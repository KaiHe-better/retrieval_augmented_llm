These fibroblasts are large irregular\nnucleated cells derived mainly from the proliferation of the fixed\nconnective-tissue cells of the part, and to a less extent from the\nlymphocytes and other mononuclear cells which have migrated from the\nvessels. Among the fibroblasts, larger multi-nucleated cells--_giant\ncells_--are sometimes found, particularly when resistant substances,\nsuch as silk ligatures or fragments of bone, are embedded in the\ntissues, and their function seems to be to soften such substances\npreliminary to their being removed by the phagocytes. Numerous\n_polymorpho-nuclear leucocytes_, which have wandered from the vessels,\nare also present in the spaces. These act as phagocytes, their function\nbeing to remove the red corpuscles and fibrin of the original clot, and\nthis performed, they either pass back into the circulation in virtue of\ntheir amoeboid movement, or are themselves eaten up by the growing\nfibroblasts. Beyond this phagocytic action, they do not appear to play\nany direct part in the reparative process. These young capillary loops,\nwith their supporting cells and fluids, constitute granulation tissue,\nwhich is usually fully formed in from three to five days, after which it\nbegins to be replaced by cicatricial or scar tissue.\n _Formation of Cicatricial Tissue._--The transformation of this temporary\ngranulation tissue into scar tissue is effected by the fibroblasts,\nwhich become elongated and spindle-shaped, and produce in and around\nthem a fine fibrillated material which gradually increases in quantity\ntill it replaces the cell protoplasm. In this way white fibrous tissue\nis formed, the cells of which are arranged in parallel lines and\neventually become grouped in bundles, constituting fully formed white\nfibrous tissue. In its growth it gradually obliterates the capillaries,\nuntil at the end of two, three, or four weeks both vessels and cells\nhave almost entirely disappeared, and the original wound is occupied by\ncicatricial tissue. In course of time this tissue becomes consolidated,\nand the cicatrix undergoes a certain amount of contraction--_cicatricial\ncontraction_.\n\ndocument (2) \n\n_The process of granulation_ is not dissimilar to that described above,\nsave only in its gross appearances. Granulations consist of vascular\nbuds surrounded by leukocytes and lightly covered by them, while around\nthe base of each bud epithelioid and spindle cells arrange themselves,\nthese fixed cells organizing themselves more and more, as the wound\nfills up, with the more superficial layers of granulations. In time\nthey are converted into a dense fibrous tissue which forms later what\nis known as the _scar_. As before, also, the spaces between the young\ncapillary loops are filled with large nucleated cells derived from\nthe fixed cells of the tissue, and from the endothelial lining of the\nnewly formed vessels. Thus fibroblasts are produced in each case, and\nare often more or less mingled with giant cells, especially if some\nforeign body, such as a silk ligature, be embodied in the tissues. The\nparticular function of the leukocytes seems to be the removal of red\ncorpuscles and fibrin from the original clot.\n The _granulation tissue_ thus constituted by capillary loops and\nproliferating cells constitutes the basis of all wound repair. Later\nthis tissue assumes more of the fibrous and less of the cellular\ncharacter, while the fibroblasts arrange themselves in accordance with\nthe mechanical requirements of the tissues and the stress or strain\nplaced upon them. This tissue is at first vascular, but as it condenses\nits capillaries become less numerous and smaller, and the final white\nfibrous scar is usually almost bloodless.\n When there has been loss of skin, or when skin edges are not brought\ntogether, the deeper process of granulation needs an epithelial\ncovering, which cannot be afforded by mesoblastic or endothelial cells.\nThe formation of an epithelial or epidermal covering is a process\npeculiar to epithelial tissue alone, and takes place mainly from the\ncells of the rete Malpighii.\n\ndocument (3) \n\nA complex form of so-called dermoid cyst is met with in which there are\nunstriped muscle fiber, teeth, mammary glands, etc. These belong rather\nto the class of teratomas, as they contain more or less tissue not of\nepiblastic origin.\n A _dermoid tumor_ is one lacking cystic characteristics, made up of\ntissue largely developed from the epiblast, with more or less tissue of\nmesoblastic origin. Such a tumor may contain much connective tissue,\nfat, fetal hyaline cartilage, and nerve tissue, while from its exterior\nlong hair may grow, and teeth project from its surface or be embedded\nwithin its substance. Such tumors are generally found in the pharynx\nand about the rectum.\n The explanation of dermoids and teratomas may be gleaned from\nembryology, and rests upon the arrangement of the different\nblastodermic layers of the developing ovum, and upon the facts already\nalluded to in explaining Cohnheim s hypothesis of the origin of tumors.\nStrictly speaking, a _dermoid_ should contain only that which may be\ndeveloped from the _epiblastic_ layer. It is well known that teeth\nand hair, as well as sebaceous material, are epiblastic products.\nConsequently such material may be found within a dermoid and needs\nno further explanation than an epiblastic inclusion, according to\nCohnheim s views. But so soon as such a tumor contains bone, muscle,\netc. (_i. e._, tissues of mesoblastic origin), we should drop the term\n_dermoid_ and consider it a _teratoma_. Such is the distinction between\nthese two terms. According to Wilm s researches, any tumor of this sort\nwhich contains epithelial products as teeth or hair is sure to contain\nalso mesoblastic elements, and thus to belong to the latter. The term\n_epidermoids_ has been applied to the former.\n\ndocument (4) \n\n#Fibroma.#--A fibroma is a tumour composed of fibrous connective tissue.\nA distinction may be made between the _soft fibroma_, which is\ncomparatively rich in cells and blood vessels, and in which the fibres\nare arranged loosely; and the _hard fibroma_, which is composed of\nclosely packed bundles of fibres often arranged in a concentric fashion\naround the blood vessels. The cut surface of the soft fibroma presents a\npinkish-white, fleshy appearance, resembling the slowly growing forms of\nsarcoma; that of a hard fibroma presents a dry, glistening appearance,\naptly compared to watered silk. The soft variety grows much more rapidly\nthan the hard. In certain fibromas--in those, for example, which grow\nfrom the periosteum of the base of the skull and project into the\nnaso-pharynx--the blood vessels are dilated into sinuses and have no\nproper sheaths; they therefore tend to remain open when divided, and to\nbleed excessively. Transition forms between soft fibroma and sarcoma are\nmet with, so that in operating for their removal it is safer to take\naway the capsule along with the tumour, and the patient should be kept\nunder observation in view of the risk of recurrence.\n The skin--especially the skin of the buttock--is one of the favourite\nseats of fibroma, and it may occur in a multiple form. It is met with\nalso in the subcutaneous and intermuscular cellular tissue, and in the\nabdominal wall, where it sometimes attains considerable dimensions.\nVarious forms of fibroma are met with in the mamma and are described\nwith diseases of that organ. The fibrous overgrowths in the skin, known\nas _keloid_ and _molluscum fibrosum_, and those met with in the _sheaths\nof nerves_, are described elsewhere. Fibroid tumours of the uterus are\ndescribed with myoma.\n _Diffuse fibroma_ or _Fibromatosis_, analogous to lipomatosis, is met\nwith in the connective tissue of the skin and sheaths of nerves, and\nconstitutes one form of neuro-fibromatosis; a similar change is also met\nwith in the stomach and colon.\n\ndocument (5) \n\n=Fibroma.=--Fibromas are tumors composed of fibrous tissue, which, when\nof pure type, are found to be not so common as was formerly supposed,\nthe majority of tumors hitherto roughly grouped as fibromas containing\neither muscle tissue or sarcomatous elements, which takes them out of\nthe category of pure fibroma. A typical fibroma is ordinarily dense,\nand is composed of wavy bundles of fibrous tissue whose cells are long\nand slender and closely packed together, the mass being permeated by\ndistinct bloodvessels.\n Fibroma occurs most commonly in the _ovary_, the _uterus_, the\n_intestine_, the _gum_ (epulis), in _nerve sheaths_, and in the\n_skin_ in the form of so-called _painful subcutaneous tubercles_ and\n_molluscum fibrosum_. There is also a fibrous tumor of the skin, known\nas _keloid_, sustaining to fibroma the same relation that exists\nbetween exostosis and osteoma.\n _Painful subcutaneous tubercle_ is a sample of pure fibroma in the\nshape of a small, flattened, pea-like tumor which never attains great\nsize. It is situated loosely in the subcutaneous structure and may form\na visible prominence. Insignificant as it would thus appear, it becomes\nthe seat of exasperating pain, particularly when touched or handled,\nwhich may radiate to considerable distances. The etiology of these\ngrowths is unknown.\n In the ovary, the uterus, the intestine, and the larynx true fibrous\ntumors are pathological curiosities rather than common lesions.\n [Illustration: FIG. 74\n Keloid of external ear: _a_, dense tissue of skin; _b_, fibrous\nconnective tissue; _c_, epidermis.
