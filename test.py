With treatment, it is generally agreed that pregnancy does not alter maternal outcome from thermal injury compared with that of nonpregnant women ofsimilar age. As perhaps expected, maternal and fetal survival parallels the percentage of burned surface area (Parikh, 2015). Karimi and colleagues (2009) reported higher mortality rates for both with suicidal attempts and with inhalational injuries. The composite mortality rate for nearly 400 women from seven studies increased in a linear fashion as the percent of burned body surface area increased 47-12). For 20-, 40-, and 60-percent burns, the maternal mortality rates were approximately 4, 30, and 93 percent, respectively. he corresponding fetal mortality rates were 20, 48, and 96 percent, respectively. With severe burns, the woman usually enters labor spontaneously within a few days to a week and often delivers a stillborn. Contributory factors are hypovolemia, pulmonary injury, septicemia, and the intensely catabolic state (Radosevich, 2013).\n Following serious abdominal burns, skin contractures that develop may be painful during a subsequent pregnancy and may even require surgical decompression and split-skin autografts (Mitsukawa, 2015; Radosevich, 2013). Loss or distortion of nipples may cause problems in breastfeeding. Mitsukawa and associates (2015) reported that contracture release was indicated with scars spanning more thanr>75 percent of the total abdominal area. Alternatively, normal abdominal tissue expansion due to pregnancy appears to be an excellent source for obtaining skin grafts postpartum to correct scar deformities at other body sites (Del Frari, 2004).\n Earlier case reports suggested a high fetal mortality rate with electric shock (Fatovich, 1993). In a prospective cohort study, however, Einarson and coworkers (1997) showed similar perinatal outcomes in 31 injured women compared with those of noninjured controls. They concluded that traditional 110volt North American electrical current likely is less dangerous than the 220-volt currents available in Europe. A woman with been related to a mild electrical shock at 22 weeks was described (Sozen, 2004). Another woman with brain death from cardiac arrest was reported (Sparic, 2014). Thermal burns with electro cution may be extensive.\n\ndocument (2) \n\nSamarasekera EJ et al: Topical therapies for the treatment of plaque psoriasis: Systematic review and network meta-analyses. Br J Dermatol 2013;168:954.\n Initiation of oral doxycycline therapy was discussed with the patient. She expressed concerns regarding possible adverse effects of prolonged systemic therapy. In light of this, daily morning application of brimonidine 0.33% gel was added to her treatment regimen. The patient noted prompt response with significant improvement of her facial redness.\n Drugs Used in the Treatment of Gastrointestinal Diseases\n Kenneth R. McQuaid, MD\n A 21-year-old woman comes with her parents to discuss therapeutic options for her Crohn s disease. She was diag-nosed with Crohn s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate con-trol of her symptoms and disease? What are the long-term management options?\n Many of the drug groups discussed elsewhere in this book have important applications in the treatment of diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and other organs. Other groups are used almost exclusively for their effects on the gut; these are discussed in the following text according to their therapeutic uses.\n\ndocument (3) \n\nPainless vaginal bleeding is reported by 90 percent of women with a cervical pregnancy-a third of these have massive hemorrhage (Ushakov, 1997). As pregnancy progresses, a distended, thin-walled cervix with a partially dilated external os may be evident. Above the cervical mass, a slightly enlarged uterine fundus can be felt. Identification of cervical pregnancy is based on speculum examination, palpation, and TVS. Sonographic indings typical of cervical pregnancy are shown and described in Figure 19-10. MR imaging and 3-D sonography have also been used to confirm the diagnosis Q ung, 2001; Sherer, 2008).\n Cervical pregnancy may be treated medically or surgically. Conservative management strives to minimize hemorrhage, resolve the pregnancy, and preserve fertility. In many centers, including ours, methotrexate has become the first-line therapy in stable women, and administration follows protocols listed in Table 19-1 (Verma, 2011; Zakaria, 2011). he drug has also been injected directly into the gestational sac, alone or with systemic doses Qeng, 2007; 1urji, 2015). Others describe MTX infusion combined with uterine artery embolization"chemoembolization" (Xiaolin, 2010).\n FIGURE 19-10 Cervical pregnancy. Transvaginal sonographic findings may include: (1) an hourglass uterine shape and ballooned cervical canal; (2) gestational tissue at the level of the cervix (black arrow); (3) absent intrauterine gestational tissue (white arrows); and (4) a portion of the endocervical canal seen interposed between the gestation and the endometrial canal.

Initial blood tests include a complete blood count, a determination of blood type with h status, and an antibody screen. The Institute of Medicine recommends universal human immunodeiciency virus (HIV) testing, with patient notiication and right of refusal, as a routine part of prenatal care. The CDC (Branson, 2006) as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (20 16f, 2017) continue to support this practice. If a woman declines testing, this is recorded in the prenatal record. All pregnant women are also screened for hepatitis B virus infection, syphilis, and immunity to rubella at the initial visit. Based on their prospective investigation of 1000 women, Murray and coworkers (2002) concluded that in the absence of hypertension, routine urinalysis beyond the irst prenatal visit was not necessary. A urine culture is recommended by most because treating bacteruria signiicantly reduces the likelihood of developing symptomatic urinary tract infections in pregnancy (Chap. 53, p. 1026).\n Chlamydia trachomatis is isolated from the cervix in 2 to 13 percent of pregnant women. he American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017) recommend that all women be screened for chlamydia during the irst prenatal visit, with additional third-trimester testing for those at increased risk. Risk factors include unmarried status, recent change in sexual partner or multiple concurrent partners, age younger than 25 years, inner-city residence, history or presence of other sexually transmitted diseases, and little or no prenatal care. For those testing positive, treatment described in Chapter 65 (p. 1240) is followed by a second testing-a test of cure-3 to 4 weeks after treatment completion.\n\ndocument (5) \n\nFrom Wendel, 1985, with permission.\n Distinct from allergy, a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction develops following penicillin treatment in most women with primary syphilis and approximately half with secondary infection. Uterine contractions, mild maternal temperature elevation, decreased fetal movement, and fetal heart rate decelerations are findings. Reaction treatment is supportive with antipyretics as needed, hydration, and oxygen supplementation (Klein, 1990). In a study of 50 gravidas who received benzathine penicillin for syphilis, Myles and associates (1998) reported a 40-percent incidence of Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions. Of the 31 women monitored electronically, 42 percent developed regular uterine contractions, and 39 percent developed variable decelerations. All contractions resolved within 24 hours of therapy. Accordingly, for fetuses of viable age, some recommend administering the irst dose of antibiotic in labor and delivery and with continuous fetal monitoring for at least 24 hours (Rae, 2017). Others recommend this only if sonographic signs of fetal syphilis, described earlier, are found (Duf, 2014; Wendel, 2002). If this second plan is elected, patients are counseled on reaction signs and encouraged to seek evaluation if they develop.\n Of notiiable STDs, infections caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae are the second most common. The incidence of gonorrhea in the United States has continued to rise since 2009, and in 2015, the rate was 124 cases per 100,000 persons (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016c). he highest rates in women of any ethnicity were in those aged 15 to 24 years. In pregnant women, its prevalence approximates 0.6 percent (Blatt, 2012). In most pregnant women, infection is limited to the lower genital tract-the cervix, urethra, and periurethral and vestibular glands. Acute salpingitis is rare in pregnancy. But, pregnant women account for a disproportionate number of disseminated gonococcal infections (Bleich, 2012).\n\n'
