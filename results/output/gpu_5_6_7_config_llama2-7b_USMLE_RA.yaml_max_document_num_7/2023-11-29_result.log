of the PIP joints produce traction on the neurovascular structures but usually do not lacerate them. In general, the patient should not be sent home with a joint that remains dislocated. Most commonly, the distal part is dorsal to the proximal shaft and sits in a hyperextended position. For this patient, the examiner gently applies pressure to the base of the distal part until it passes beyond the head of the proximal phalanx. Once there, the relocated PIP joint is gently flexed, confirming the joint is in fact reduced. The joint is splinted in slight flexion to

CHAPTER 43 Disorders of Hearing

FIguRE 43-3 Presbyacusis or age-related hearing loss. The audiogram shows a moderate to severe downsloping sensorineural hearing loss typical of presbyacusis. The loss of high-frequency hearing is associated with a decreased speech discrimination score; consequently, patients complain of lack of clarity of hearing, especially in a noisy background. HL, hearing threshold level; SRT, speech reception threshold.

invariably appears as the disease progresses and increases in severity during acute attacks. The annual incidence of Ménière’s disease is 0.5– 7.5 per 1000; onset is most frequently in the fifth decade of life but may also occur in young adults or the elderly. Histologically, there is distention of the endolymphatic system (endolymphatic hydrops) leading to degeneration of vestibular and cochlear hair cells. This may result from endolymphatic sac dysfunction secondary to infection, trauma, autoimmune disease, inflammatory causes, or tumor; an idiopathic etiology constitutes the largest category and is most accurately referred to as Ménière’s disease. Although any pattern of hearing loss can be observed, typically, low-frequency, unilateral sensorineural hearing impairment is present. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be obtained to exclude retrocochlear pathology such as a cerebellopontine angle tumor or demyelinating disorder. Therapy is directed toward the control of vertigo. A 2-g/d low-salt diet is the mainstay of treatment for control of rotatory vertigo. Diuretics, a short course of glucocorticoids, and intratympanic gentamicin may also be useful adjuncts in recalcitrant cases. Surgical therapy of vertigo is reserved for unresponsive cases and includes endolymphatic sac decompression, labyrinthectomy, and vestibular nerve section. Both labyrinthectomy and vestibular nerve section abolish rotatory vertigo in >90% of cases. Unfortunately, there is no effective therapy for hearing loss, tinnitus, or aural fullness from Ménière’s disease.

document (1) 

In typical Ménière disease, the attacks of vertigo are abrupt and last for several minutes to an hour or longer. The vertigo is unmistakably whirling or rotational and usually so severe that the patient cannot stand or walk. Varying degrees of nausea and vomiting, low-pitched tinnitus, a feeling of fullness in one ear and a diminution in hearing are practically always associated. Nystagmus is present during the acute attack; it is horizontal in type, usually with a rotary component and with the slow phase to the side of the affected ear. On attempting to touch a target with the eyes closed, there is past pointing as well as a tendency to fall toward the affected ear when standing or walking. The patient prefers to lie with the faulty ear uppermost and is disinclined to look toward the normal side, which exaggerates the nystagmus and dizziness. As the attack subsides, hearing improves, as does the sensation of fullness in the ear; with further attacks, however, there is a progressive increase in deafness.

The attacks vary considerably in frequency and severity. They may recur several times weekly for many weeks on end, or there may be remissions of several years’ duration. Frequently recurring attacks may give rise to a mild chronic state of disequilibrium and a reluctance to move the head or to turn quickly. With milder forms of the disease, the patient may complain more of head discomfort and of difficulty in concentrating than of vertigo and then may be considered to signify anxiety. Symptoms of anxiety are common in patients with Ménière disease, particularly in those with frequent severe attacks.

There was a history of laryngeal cancer and renal cancer but with no evidence of recurrent disease; these malignancies were not considered contributory to his SIAD. Biopsy of the lung mass ultimately confirmed the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer, which is responsible for ~75% of malignancy-associated SIAD; ~10% of patients with this neuroendocrine tumor will have a plasma Na+ concentration of <130 meq/L at presentation. The patient had no other “nonosmotic” stimuli for an increase in AVP, with no

sought medical advice soon after the appearance of the initial symptom, some later, after other symptoms had occurred. One-third of the patients were troubled by vertigo associated with nausea, vomiting, and pressure in the ear. The vertiginous symptoms differed from those of Ménière disease in that discrete attacks separated by periods of normalcy were rare. The vertigo coincided more or less with hearing loss and tinnitus (most often a unilateral high-pitched ringing, sometimes a machinery-like roaring or hissing sound, like that of a steam kettle). Some of our patients ignored their deafness for many months or

This patient developed hyponatremia in the context of a central lung mass and postobstructive pneumonia. He was clinically euvolemic, with a generous urine Na+ concentration and low plasma uric acid concentration. He was euthyroid, with no evidence of pituitary dysfunction or secondary adrenal insufficiency. The clinical presentation is consistent with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). Although pneumonia was a potential contributor to the SIAD, it was notable that the plasma Na+ concentration decreased despite a clinical response to antibiotics. It was suspected that this patient had SIAD due to small-cell lung cancer, with

Certain biologic and clinical data assume clinical importance. The highest incidence is in the fifth and sixth decades of life, and the sexes are equally affected. Familial occurrence is a mark, usually, of von Recklinghausen disease. The earliest symptom reported by the 46 patients in the decades-old but instructive series of Ojemann and coworkers was loss of hearing (33 of 46 patients); headache (4 patients); disturbed sense of balance (3 patients); unsteadiness of gait (3 patients); and facial pain, tinnitus, and facial weakness, each in a single case.

Systemic embolic disease manifestations, such as fever, abdominal pain, and weight loss, are present in less than half of patients, although cutaneous manifestations including livedo reticularis and localized toe gangrene may be more common. Worsening hypertension and deteriorating kidney function are common, sometimes reaching a malignant phase. Progressive renal failure can occur and require dialytic support. These cases often develop after a stuttering onset over many weeks and have an ominous prognosis. Mortality rate after 1 year reaches 38%, and although some may eventually recover sufficiently to no longer require dialysis, many do not.

Beyond the clinical manifestations above, laboratory findings include rising creatinine, transient eosinophilia (60–80%), elevated sedimentation rate, and hypocomplementemia (15%). Establishing this diagnosis can be difficult and is often by exclusion. Definitive diagnosis depends on kidney biopsy demonstrating microvessel occlusion with cholesterol crystals that leave a “cleft” in the vessel. Biopsies obtained from patients undergoing surgical revascularization of the kidney indicate that silent cholesterol emboli are frequently present before any further manipulation is performed.

No effective therapy is available for atheroembolic disease once it has developed. Withdrawal of anticoagulation is recommended. Late recovery of kidney function after supportive measures sometimes occurs, and statin therapy may improve outcome. The role of embolic protection devices in the renal circulation is unclear, but a few prospective trials have failed to demonstrate major benefits. These devices are limited to distal protection during the endovascular procedure and offer no protection from embolic debris after removal.

Occlusion of large renal vessels, including arteries and veins, is an uncommon cause of acute renal failure. A significant reduction in GFR by this mechanism suggests bilateral processes or, in a patient with a single functioning kidney, a unilateral process. Renal arteries can be occluded with atheroemboli, thromboemboli, in situ thrombosis, aortic dissection, or vasculitis. Atheroembolic renal failure can occur spontaneously but most often is associated with recent aortic instrumentation. The emboli are cholesterol-rich and lodge in medium and small renal arteries, with a consequent eosinophil-rich inflammatory reaction. Patients with atheroembolic acute renal failure often have a normal urinalysis, but the urine may contain eosinophils and casts. The diagnosis can be confirmed by renal biopsy, but this procedure is often unnecessary when other stigmata of atheroemboli are present (livedo reticularis, distal peripheral infarcts, eosinophilia).

In the United States, macular degeneration is the leading cause of permanent bilateral visual loss in the elderly.

Risk factors include age > 40 years, African-American ethnicity, diabetes, and myopia.

Hx/PE: Usually asymptomatic until late in the clinical course, when patients may begin to notice visual deficits. Should be suspected in patients > 35 years of age who need frequent lens changes and have mild headaches, visual disturbances, and impaired adaptation to darkness. The earliest visual defect is seen in the peripheral nasal fields. Cupping of the optic nerve head is seen on funduscopic exam.

Visual acuity has been estimated to be 20/200 in newborns and 20/20 in6-month-old infants. Standard visual charts displaying picturesinstead of letters can be used to assess visual acuity in toddlers.Peripheral vision is tested by surreptitiously bringing objectsinto the visual field from behind. A reduced pupillary reactionto light suggests anterior visual pathway lesions, including theretina, optic nerves, and chiasm. Unilateral optic nerve lesionsare identified by the swinging flashlight test. With an optic nerveabnormality, both pupils constrict when light is directed into thenormal eye. When light is swung over to the abnormal eye, bothpupils dilate inappropriately; this is called an afferent pupillary defect or Marcus Gunn pupil. Interruption of the sympatheticinnervation to the pupil produces Horner’s syndrome (ptosis,miosis, and unilateral facial anhidrosis). In this instance, anisocoria (unequal pupils) is more pronounced in a dark room,because the affected pupil is unable to dilate appropriately.Lesions of the posterior visual pathway, including the lateralgeniculate, optic radiations, and occipital cortex, have normalpupillary light reactions but are expressed by loss of visual fields.

These three cranial nerves control eye movement and are most easily examined with the use of a colorful toy to capture the child’s attention. For infants too young to fix and follow, rotating the infant’s head assesses oculocephalic vestibular reflexes (doll’s eye maneuver). If the brainstem is intact, rotating a newborn or comatose patient’s head to the right causes the eyes to move to the left, and vice versa. In awake, older patients, voluntary eye movements mask the reflex.

Intraocular pressure will rise if the normal cycle of aqueous humor fluid production and absorption is disturbed so that the amount of fluid increases. This condition is glaucoma and can lead to a variety of visual problems including blindness, which results from compression of the retina and its blood supply.

In the clinic

With increasing age and in certain disease states the lens of the eye becomes opaque. Increasing opacity results in increasing visual impairment. A common operation is excision of the cloudy lens and replacement with a new man-made lens.

In the clinic

Direct visualization of the postremal (vitreous) chamber of the eye is possible in most clinical settings. It is achieved using an ophthalmoscope, which is a small battery-operated light with a tiny lens that allows direct visualization of the postremal (vitreous) chamber and the posterior wall of the eye through the pupil and the lens. It is sometimes necessary to place a drug directly onto the eye to dilate the pupil for better visualization.

The optic nerve, observed as the optic disc, is easily seen. The typical four branches of the central retinal artery and the fovea are also seen.

Using ophthalmoscopy the physician can look for diseases of the optic nerve, vascular abnormalities, and changes within the retina (Fig. 8.109).

In the clinic

High-definition optical coherence tomography (HD-OCT) (Fig. 8.111) is a procedure used to obtain subsurface images of translucent or opaque materials. It is similar to ultrasound, except that it uses light instead of sound to produce high-resolution cross-sectional images. It is especially useful in the diagnosis and management of optic nerve and retinal diseases.

An epiretinal membrane (Fig. 8.112) is a thin sheet of fibrous tissue that develops on the surface of the retina in the area of the macula and can cause visual problems. If the visual problems are significant, surgical removal of the membrane may be necessary.

Occurs when the iris dilates and pushes against the lens of the eye, disrupting ﬂow of aqueous humor into the anterior chamber. Pressure in the posterior chamber then pushes the peripheral iris forward and blocks the angle.

Risk factors include family history, older age, Asian ethnicity, hyperopia, prolonged pupillary dilation (prolonged time in a dark area, stress, medications), anterior uveitis, and lens dislocation.

Hx/PE: Classically presents with extreme eye pain, blurred vision, headache, nausea, and vomiting. A hard, red eye is seen (from acute closure of a narrow anterior chamber angle); the pupil is dilated and nonreactive to light. IOP is ↑. If it resolves spontaneously prior to presentation (e.g., with pupillary constriction in sunlight), ophthalmologic examination may reveal narrow angles in one or both eyes.

Dx: Diagnosis is based on clinical history and examination. Those that resolve may mimic a migraine headache with blurred vision; the distinction is that the headaches and blurred vision are more likely to be triggered by darkness (due to pupillary dilation) rather than by bright lights (migraine).

Most patients with this disease pres-ent with abdominal pain. Other symptoms include nausea and vomiting, weight loss, anorexia, and altered bowel habits. This may appear as a chronic or acute disorder. On physical exam, patients may be found to have tenderness and distension. Up to 50% of patients are found to have an abdominal mass that often transmits aortic pulsations.Abdominal CT with IV contrast

140/90 mm Hg) increases the risk of eventual end-organ damage. Starting at 115/75 mm Hg, cardiovascular disease risk doubles with each increment of 20/10 mm Hg throughout the blood pressure range. Both systolic hypertension and diastolic hypertension are associated with end-organ damage; so-called isolated systolic hypertension is not benign. The risks—and therefore the urgency of instituting therapy—increase in proportion to the magnitude of blood pressure elevation. The risk of end-organ damage at any level of blood pressure or age is greater in African Americans and relatively less in premenopausal women than in men. Other positive risk factors include smoking; metabolic syndrome, including obesity, dyslipidemia, and diabetes; manifestations of end-organ damage at the time of diagnosis; and a family history of cardiovascular disease.

It should be noted that the diagnosis of hypertension depends on measurement of blood pressure and not on symptoms reported by the patient. In fact, hypertension is usually asymptomatic until overt end-organ damage is imminent or has already occurred.

Etiology of Hypertension

A specific cause of hypertension can be established in only 10–15% of patients. Patients in whom no specific cause of hypertension can be found are said to have essential or primary hypertension. Patients with a specific etiology are said to have secondary hypertension. It is important to consider specific causes in each case, however, because some of them are amenable to definitive surgical treatment: renal artery constriction, coarctation of the aorta, pheochromocytoma, Cushing’s disease, and primary aldosteronism.

commonly affects individuals in the fourth to sixth decades of life. Some studies suggest a 2:1 male-to-female predominance, but others have not found a gender predilection. Patients with this condition present with nonspecific findings. Most patients are diagnosed after ure-teral obstruction. Patients may complain of dull or acute back or flank pain. Systemic complaints include anorexia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, fever, and malaise. Decreased urinary out-put may ensue if the ureters become fibrotic. Because of renal artery impingement, patients are commonly hypertensive on exam. Other physical exam findings include lower extremity edema

Decompensation may warrant balloon pericardiotomy and pericardial window.

Until recently, rheumatic fever (which affects the mitral valve more often than the aortic valve) was the most common cause of valvular heart disease in U.S. adults; the leading cause is now mechanical degeneration. Subtypes are listed in Table 2.1-18 along with their etiologies, presentation, diagnosis, and treatment.

Aortic aneurysms are most commonly associated with atherosclerosis. Most are abdominal, and > 90% originate below the renal arteries.

Usually asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on exam or radiologic study.

Risk factors include hypertension, high cholesterol, other vascular disease, a family history, smoking, gender (males > females), and age.

Patients with a bileaﬂet aortic valve with no risk factors (atrial fibrillation, previous thromboembolism, left ventricular dysfunction, a hypercoagulable state, older generation thrombogenic valve) generally do not require anticoagulation bridging. Warfarin should be stopped 72 hours prior to the procedure and resumed 24 hours after the procedure. In contrast, patients with a mechanical aortic valve and any above mentioned risk factor, or a mechanical mitral valve, should be bridged with intravenous unfractionated heparin when the INR falls below 2. The heparin drip should be stopped approximately 6 to 8 hours before the procedure and restarted as soon as possible after surgery when the patient is deemed stable from postoperative bleeding risk. The heparin bridge can be stopped when the INR reaches therapeutic levels (207).

In the postoperative period, patients with mitral stenosis should be carefully monitored for pulmonary edema because they may not be able to compensate for the amount of intravenous ﬂuid administered during surgery. Prevention of tachycardia is important, as it may lead to pulmonary edema. Patients with mitral stenosis frequently have pulmonary hypertension and decreased airway compliance. They may require more pulmonary support and therapy postoperatively, including prolonged mechanical ventilation.

Cardiac catheterization is performed after the patient has fasted for 6 hours and has received intravenous conscious sedation to remain awake but sedated during the procedure. All patients with suspected coronary artery disease are pretreated with 325 mg aspirin. In patients in whom the procedure is likely to progress to a percutaneous coronary intervention, an additional antiplatelet agent should be started: clopidogrel (600-mg loading dose and 75 mg daily) or prasugrel (60-mg loading dose and 10 mg daily), or ticagrelor (180-mg loading and 90 mg twice daily). Prasugrel should not be selected for individuals with prior stroke or transient ischemic attack. Warfarin is held starting 2–3 days prior to the catheterization to allow the international normalized ratio (INR) to fall to <1.7 and limit access-site bleeding complications. Cardiac catheterization is a sterile procedure, so antibiotic prophylaxis is not required.

Cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography provide a detailed hemodynamic and anatomic assessment of the heart and coronary arteries. The selection of procedures is dependent on the patient’s symptoms and clinical condition, with some direction provided by noninvasive studies.

Left Heart Catheterization This procedure measures pressures in the left heart as a determinant of left ventricular performance. With the aid of fluoroscopy, a catheter is guided to the ascending aorta and across the aortic valve into the left ventricle to provide a direct measure of left ventricular pressure. In patients with a tilting-disc prosthetic aortic valve, crossing the valve with a catheter is contraindicated, and the left heart may be accessed via a transseptal technique from the right atrium using a needle-tipped catheter to puncture the atrial septum at the fossa ovalis. Once the catheter crosses from the right to the left atrium, it can be advanced across the mitral valve to the left ventricle. This technique is also used for mitral valvuloplasty. Heparin is given for prolonged procedures to limit the risk of stroke from embolism of clots that may form on the catheter. For patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, the direct thrombin inhibitors bivalirudin (0.75 mg/kg bolus, 1.75 mg/kg per hour for the duration of the procedure) or argatroban (350 μg/kg bolus, 15 μg/kg per minute for the duration of the procedure) may be used.

If intravenous or oral administration of hormonal therapy controls the bleeding, oral progestin therapy should be instituted and continued for several days to stabilize the endometrium. This therapy can be accomplished by using a combination oral contraceptive, usually one with 30 to 35 mg of estrogen, or by using the tapering regimen previously described. The medication can be tapered and ultimately must be stopped to allow withdrawal bleeding, which may be heavy, given an excessively built-up endometrium. Low-dose combination oral contraception once daily should be continued for three to six cycles, or longer if desired, to provide normal menstrual cycles. Manipulation of the regimen by increasing or decreasing the dose of oral contraceptives to twice a day or three times a day after the initial high dose therapy should be discouraged.

In general, the prognosis for regular ovulatory cycles and subsequent normal fertility in young women who experience an episode of abnormal bleeding is good, particularly for patients who develop abnormal bleeding as a result of anovulation within the first years after menarche and in whom there are no signs of other specific conditions. Some girls, including those in whom there is an underlying medical cause, such as PCOS, will continue to have abnormal bleeding into middle and late adolescence and adulthood and will benefit from the ongoing use of oral contraceptives to manage hirsutism, acne, and irregular periods. Ovulation induction may ultimately be necessary to achieve fertility in these individuals, although teens should be advised that they should not assume that they are infertile. Individuals with coagulopathies may benefit from ongoing oral contraceptive use, use of tranexamic acid, or intranasal desmopressin (99).

A progestin-releasing intrauterine device (IUD) can be effective in managing heavy bleeding, and may be appropriate for adolescent use (100,101). The levonorgestrel IUD is approved by the FDA for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding in women requiring contraception and is recommended as first-line medical therapy for this group of women (102).

For patients with underlying medical conditions, such as coagulopathies, a malignancy requiring chemotherapy, or developmental disabilities, long-term therapeutic amenorrhea with menstrual suppression using the following regimens may be necessary or helpful (103): 1.

Fibroadenoma Fibroadenomas are the most common benign tumors of the breast. In one series, they accounted for 50% of all breast biopsies (141). They usually occur in young women (age 20 to 35 years) and may occur in teenagers (142). In women younger than 25 years, fibroadenomas are more common than cysts. They rarely occur after menopause, although occasionally they are found, often calcified, in postmenopausal women. For this reason, it is postulated that fibroadenomas are responsive to estrogen stimulation. A study reports the de novo occurrence of fibroadenoma in 51 women older than age 35 years who had no evidence of a palpable or mammographic visualized lesion in well-documented prior visits (143). Fibroadenomas may appear as single masses or as multiple lesions.

Clinically, a young woman usually notices a mass while showering or dressing. Most masses are 2 to 3 cm in diameter when detected, but they can become extremely large (i.e., the giant fibroadenoma). On physical examination, they are firm, smooth, and rubbery. They do not elicit an inﬂammatory reaction, are freely mobile, and cause no dimpling of the skin or nipple retraction. They are often bilobed, and a groove can be palpated on examination. On mammographic and ultrasonographic imaging, the typical features are of a well-defined, smooth, solid mass with clearly defined margins and dimensions that are longer than wide and craniocaudad dimensions that are less than the length.

Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5°C [101.3°F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug interactions?

The basic formulas of the sulfonamides and their structural similarity to p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) are shown in Figure 46–1. Sulfonamides with varying physical, chemical, pharmacologic, and antibacterial properties are produced by attaching substituents to the amido group ( ⎯ SO2 ⎯ NH ⎯ R) or the amino group ( ⎯ NH2) of the sulfanilamide nucleus. Sulfonamides tend to be much more soluble at alkaline than at acid pH. Most can be prepared as sodium salts, which are used for intravenous administration.

2023-11-29 14:08:50,470 query: A 24-year-old G2P1 woman at 39 weeks’ gestation presents to the emergency department complaining of painful contractions occurring every 10 minutes for the past 2 hours, consistent with latent labor. She says she has not experienced vaginal discharge, bleeding, or fluid leakage, and is currently taking no medications. On physical examination, her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, heart rate is 86/min, and temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F). She has had little prenatal care and uses condoms inconsistently. Her sexually transmitted infections status is unknown. As part of the patient’s workup, she undergoes a series of rapid screening tests that result in the administration of zidovudine during delivery. The infant is also given zidovudine to reduce the risk of transmission. A confirmatory test is then performed in the mother to confirm the diagnosis of HIV. Which of the following is most true about the confirmatory test?

HIV Infection (See also Chap. 226) The predominant cause of HIV infection in children is transmission of the virus from mother to newborn during the perinatal period. All pregnant women should be screened for HIV infection. Factors that increase the risk of mother-to-newborn transmission include high maternal viral load, low maternal CD4+ T cell count, prolonged labor, prolonged duration of membrane rupture, and the presence of other genital tract infections, such as syphilis or herpes. Prior to the widespread use of antiretroviral treatment, the perinatal transmission rate was in the range of 20%. In women with a good response to antiretroviral treatment, the transmission rate is about 1%. Measurement of maternal plasma HIV RNA copy number guides the decision for vaginal versus cesarean delivery. For women with <1000 copies of plasma HIV RNA/ml who are receiving combination antiretroviral therapy, the risk of transmission to the newborn is approximately 1% regardless of mode of delivery or duration of membrane rupture. These women may elect to attempt a vaginal birth following the spontaneous onset of labor. For women with a viral load of ≥1000 copies/ml prior to 38 weeks of gestation, a scheduled prelabor cesarean at 38 weeks is recommended to reduce the risk of HIV transmission to the newborn. To reduce the risk of mother-to-newborn transmission, women with >400 copies of HIV RNA/ml should be treated during the intrapartum interval with zidovudine. All newborns of HIV-infected mothers should be treated with zidovudine for 6 months after birth. Women who are HIV-positive may transmit the virus through their breast milk. In developed countries, HIV-infected mothers are advised not to breast-feed.

(See also Chap. 148) For rubella-nonimmune individuals contemplating pregnancy, measles-mumps-rubella vaccine should be administered, ideally at least 3 months prior to conception but otherwise in the immediate postpartum period. In addition, pregnancy is not a contraindication for vaccination against influenza, tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap), and these vaccines are recommended for appropriate individuals.

Hospitalized premature infant (<28 weeks of gestation or ≤1000-g birth weight), regardless of maternal history of varicella or VZV serologic status

In individuals >50 years of age, a VZV vaccine with 18 times the viral content of the Oka vaccine decreased the incidence of shingles by 51%, the burden of illness by 61%, and the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia by 66%. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has therefore recommended that persons in this age group be offered this vaccine in order to reduce the frequency of shingles and the severity of postherpetic neuralgia.

A second approach is to administer varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) to individuals who are susceptible, are at high risk for developing complications of varicella, and have had a significant exposure. This product should be given within 96 h (preferably within 72 h) of the exposure. Indications for administration of VZIG appear in Table 217-1.

Lastly, antiviral therapy can be given as prophylaxis to individuals at high risk who are ineligible for vaccine or who are beyond the 96-h window after direct contact. While the initial studies have used acyclovir, similar benefit can be anticipated with either valacyclovir or famciclovir. Therapy is instituted 7 days after intense exposure. At this time, the host is midway into the incubation period. This approach significantly decreases disease severity, if not totally preventing disease.

Epstein-Barr virus Infections, 218 Including Infectious Mononucleosis

Congenital CMV infections pose a much greater problem than does rubella. There is no way of identifying the infected fetus prior to birth or to prevent inapparent infections in the pregnant woman. As indicated above, if the pregnant woman has measurable titers of antibodies to CMV at the time of conception, her infant is relatively protected. Moreover, some infected infants (with viruria) may appear normal at birth but develop neural deafness and developmental delay several years later. Viral replication in infected organs continues after the first year and health workers are at risk. A second child may be infected.

There is no known treatment. The difficulties in prenatal diagnosis of maternal infection preclude planned abortion. Routine serologic testing should be done on every young woman of childbearing age. Until an effective vaccine becomes available, pregnancy should be avoided if a sexual partner is infected.

In the United States, approximately 10 percent of cases of AIDS have occurred in women, almost all of them of childbearing age, and the rate of new cases is increasing at a faster rate among them than among men. The numbers are higher in many developing countries. In children, practically all instances of AIDS come from an HIV-infected mother (“vertical transmission”). The infection may be acquired in utero, during delivery, or from breast-feeding. The relative importance of each of these modes of transmission has not been settled.

Recommended routine tests at the first prenatal encounter are listed in Table 9-1. Initial blood tests include a complete blood count, a determination of blood type with h status, and an antibody screen. The Institute of Medicine recommends universal human immunodeiciency virus (HIV) testing, with patient notiication and right of refusal, as a routine part of prenatal care. The CDC (Branson, 2006) as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (20 16f, 2017) continue to support this practice. If a woman declines testing, this is recorded in the prenatal record. All pregnant women are also screened for hepatitis B virus infection, syphilis, and immunity to rubella at the initial visit. Based on their prospective investigation of 1000 women, Murray and coworkers (2002) concluded that in the absence of hypertension, routine urinalysis beyond the irst prenatal visit was not necessary. A urine culture is recommended by most because treating bacteruria signiicantly reduces the likelihood of developing symptomatic urinary tract infections in pregnancy (Chap. 53, p. 1026).

Chlamydia trachomatis is isolated from the cervix in 2 to 13 percent of pregnant women. he American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017) recommend that all women be screened for chlamydia during the irst prenatal visit, with additional third-trimester testing for those at increased risk. Risk factors include unmarried status, recent change in sexual partner or multiple concurrent partners, age younger than 25 years, inner-city residence, history or presence of other sexually transmitted diseases, and little or no prenatal care. For those testing positive, treatment described in Chapter 65 (p. 1240) is followed by a second testing-a test of cure-3 to 4 weeks after treatment completion.

LABORATORY STUDIES Blood The smear shows large erythrocytes and a paucity of platelets and granulocytes. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is commonly increased. Reticulocytes are absent or few, and lymphocyte numbers may be normal or reduced. The presence of immature myeloid forms suggests leukemia or MDS; nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) suggest marrow fibrosis or tumor invasion; abnormal platelets suggest either peripheral destruction or MDS.

Bone Marrow The bone marrow is usually readily aspirated but dilute on smear, and the fatty biopsy specimen may be grossly pale on withdrawal; a “dry tap” instead suggests fibrosis or myelophthisis. In severe aplasia, the smear of the aspirated specimen shows only red cells, residual lymphocytes, and stromal cells; the biopsy (which should be >1 cm in length) is superior for determination of cellularity and shows mainly fat under the microscope, with hematopoietic cells occupying <25% of the marrow space; in the most serious cases, the biopsy is virtually all fat. The correlation between marrow cellularity and disease severity is imperfect, in part because marrow cellularity declines physiologically with aging. Additionally, some patients with moderate disease by blood counts will have empty iliac crest biopsies, whereas “hot spots” of hematopoiesis may be seen in severe cases. If an iliac crest specimen is inadequate, cells may also be obtained by aspiration from the sternum. Residual hematopoietic cells should have normal morphology, except for mildly megaloblastic erythropoiesis; megakaryocytes are invariably greatly reduced and usually absent. Granulomas may indicate an infectious etiology of the marrow failure.

The performance of laboratory tests should be guided to some extent by the clinical findings. Infections of the respiratory tract aSPLENIa (bronchi, sinuses) mostly suggest a defective antibody response. In Primary failure of the development of a spleen is an extremely rare general, invasive bacterial infections can result from complement diseasethatcanbeeithersyndromic(inIvemarksyndrome)orisolated deficiencies, signaling defects of innate immune responses, asplenia, with an autosomal dominant expression; in the latter case, mutations or defective antibody responses. Viral infections, recurrent Candida in the ribosomal protein SA gene were recently found. Due to the aNormal counts vary with age. For example, the lymphocyte count is between 3000 and 9000/μL of blood below the age of 3 months and between 1500 and 2500/μL in adults.

absence of natural filtration of microbes in the blood, asplenia predisposes affected individuals to fulminant infections by encapsulated bacteria. Although most infections occur in the first years of life, cases may also arise in adulthood. The diagnosis is confirmed by abdominal ultrasonography and the detection of Howell-Jolly bodies in red blood cells. Effective prophylactic measures (twice-daily oral penicillin and appropriate vaccination programs) usually prevent fatal outcomes.

Recently an immunodeficiency combining monocytopenia and dendritic and lymphoid (B and natural killer [NK]) cell deficiency (DCML), also called monocytopenia with nontuberculous mycobacterial infections (mono-MAC), has been described as a consequence of a dominantmutationinthegene GATA2,atranscriptionfactorinvolved in hematopoiesis. This condition also predisposes to lymphedema,

The median presenting leukocyte count is about 15,000/μL. Between 25 and 40% of patients have counts <5000/μL, and 20% have counts >100,000/μL. Fewer than 5% have no detectable leukemic cells in the blood. The morphology of the malignant cell varies in different subsets. In AML, the cytoplasm often contains primary (nonspecific) granules, and the nucleus shows fine, lacy chromatin with one or more nucleoli characteristic of immature cells. Abnormal rod-shaped granules called Auer rods are not uniformly present, but when they are, myeloid lineage is virtually certain (Fig. 132-1). Poor neutrophil function may be noted functionally by impaired phagocytosis and migration and morphologically by abnormal lobulation and deficient granulation.

Platelet counts <100,000/μL are found at diagnosis in ~75% of patients, and about 25% have counts <25,000/μL. Both morphologic and functional platelet abnormalities can be observed, including large and bizarre shapes with abnormal granulation and inability of platelets to aggregate or adhere normally to one another.

Pretreatment Evaluation Once the diagnosis of AML is suspected, a rapid evaluation and initiation of appropriate therapy should follow. In addition to clarifying the subtype of leukemia, initial studies should evaluate the overall functional integrity of the major organ systems, including the cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, and renal systems (Table 132-4). Factors that have prognostic significance, either for achieving CR or for predicting the duration of CR, should also be assessed before initiating treatment, including cytogenetics and molecular markers (see above). Leukemic cells should be obtained from all patients and cryopreserved for future use as new tests and therapeutics become available. All patients should be evaluated for infection.

Most patients are anemic and thrombocytopenic at presentation. Replacement of the appropriate blood components, if necessary, should begin promptly. Because qualitative platelet dysfunction or the presence of an infection may increase the likelihood of bleeding, evidence of hemorrhage justifies the immediate use of platelet transfusion, even if the platelet count is only moderately decreased.

In typical Ménière disease, the attacks of vertigo are abrupt and last for several minutes to an hour or longer. The vertigo is unmistakably whirling or rotational and usually so severe that the patient cannot stand or walk. Varying degrees of nausea and vomiting, low-pitched tinnitus, a feeling of fullness in one ear and a diminution in hearing are practically always associated. Nystagmus is present during the acute attack; it is horizontal in type, usually with a rotary component and with the slow phase to the side of the affected ear. On attempting to touch a target with the eyes closed, there is past pointing as well as a tendency to fall toward the affected ear when standing or walking. The patient prefers to lie with the faulty ear uppermost and is disinclined to look toward the normal side, which exaggerates the nystagmus and dizziness. As the attack subsides, hearing improves, as does the sensation of fullness in the ear; with further attacks, however, there is a progressive increase in deafness.

The attacks vary considerably in frequency and severity. They may recur several times weekly for many weeks on end, or there may be remissions of several years’ duration. Frequently recurring attacks may give rise to a mild chronic state of disequilibrium and a reluctance to move the head or to turn quickly. With milder forms of the disease, the patient may complain more of head discomfort and of difficulty in concentrating than of vertigo and then may be considered to signify anxiety. Symptoms of anxiety are common in patients with Ménière disease, particularly in those with frequent severe attacks.

Dx:

Acute peripheral vestibulopathy demonstrates the following:

An abnormal vestibulo-ocular reﬂex (VOR) as determined by a bedside head impulse test (i.e., rapid head rotation from lateral to center while staring at the examiner’s nose).

A predominantly horizontal nystagmus that always beats in one direction, opposite the lesion.

No vertical eye misalignment by alternate cover testing.

If patients are “high risk” (i.e., if they have atypical eye findings or any neurologic symptoms or signs, cannot stand independently, have head or neck pain, are > 50 years of age, or have one or more stroke risk factors), they should be imaged by MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging.

For low-risk patients, consider caloric testing as ancillary support for the diagnosis.

Labyrinthitis (with auditory symptoms) is mimicked by lateral pontine/ cerebellar stroke (AICA arterial territory). Vestibular neuritis (without auditory symptoms) is mimicked by lateral medullary/cerebellar stroke (PICA arterial territory).

Tx: Acute treatment consists of corticosteroids given < 72 hours after symptom onset and vestibular sedatives (e.g., meclizine). The condition usually subsides spontaneously within weeks to months. Once the hyperacute stage has passed, cautious engagement in normal physical activities and exercise should be encouraged.

A cause of recurrent vertigo with auditory symptoms that affects at least 1 in 500 in the United States. More common among females.

Hx/PE: Presents with recurrent episodes of severe vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, or ear fullness, often lasting hours to days. Nausea and vomiting are typical. Patients progressively lose low-frequency hearing over years and may become deaf on the affected side.

Dizziness can be divided into episodes that last for seconds, minutes, hours, or days. Common causes of brief dizziness (seconds) include benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and orthostatic hypotension, both of which typically are provoked by changes in head and body position. Attacks of vestibular migraine and Ménière’s disease often last hours. When episodes are of intermediate duration (minutes), transient ischemic attacks of the posterior circulation should be considered, although migraine and a number of other causes are also possible.

Symptoms that accompany vertigo may be helpful in distinguishing peripheral vestibular lesions from central causes. Unilateral hearing loss and other aural symptoms (ear pain, pressure, fullness) typically point to a peripheral cause. Because the auditory pathways quickly become bilateral upon entering the brainstem, central lesions are unlikely to cause unilateral hearing loss, unless the lesion lies near the root entry zone of the auditory nerve. Symptoms such as double vision, numbness, and limb ataxia suggest a brainstem or cerebellar lesion.

Because dizziness and imbalance can be a manifestation of a variety of neurologic disorders, the neurologic examination is important in the evaluation of these patients. Particular focus should be given to assessment of eye movements, vestibular function, and hearing.

Ageusia, or Loss of the Sense of Taste (Table 11-2)

Apart from the loss of taste sensation that accompanies normal aging, smoking is probably the most common cause of impairment of taste sensation. Extreme drying of the tongue from any cause may lead to temporary loss or reduction of the sense of taste (ageusia or hypogeusia), as saliva is essential for normal taste function. Saliva acts as a solvent for chemical substances in food and for conveying them to taste receptors. Dryness of the mouth (xerostomia) from inadequate saliva, as occurs in Sjögren syndrome; hyperviscosity of saliva, as in cystic fibrosis; irradiation of head and neck; and pandysautonomia all interfere with taste. Also, in familial dysautonomia (Riley-Day syndrome), the number of circumvallate and fungiform papillae is reduced, accounting for a diminished ability to taste sweet and salty foods. If unilateral, ageusia is seldom the source of complaint. Taste is frequently lost over the anterior two-thirds of one side of the tongue in cases of mundane Bell palsy, as indicated previously and in Chap. 44.

Mid-Systolic Murmurs Mid-systolic murmurs begin at a short interval after , end before S (Fig. 51e-1C), and are usually crescendo-decrescendo in configuration. Aortic stenosis is the most common cause of a mid-systolic murmur in an adult. The murmur of AS is usually loudest to the right of the sternum in the second intercostal space (aortic area, Fig. 51e-2) and radiates into the carotids. Transmission of the mid-systolic murmur to the apex, where it becomes higher-pitched, is common (Gallavardin effect; see above).

Differentiation of this apical systolic murmur from MR can be difficult. The murmur of AS will increase in intensity, or become louder, in the beat after a premature beat, whereas the murmur of MR will have constant intensity from beat to beat. The intensity of the AS murmur also varies directly with the cardiac output. With a normal cardiac output, a systolic thrill and a grade 4 or higher murmur suggest severe AS. The murmur is softer in the setting of heart failure and low cardiac output. Other auscultatory findings of severe AS include a soft or absent A2, paradoxical splitting of S2, an apical S4, and a late-peaking systolic murmur. In children, adolescents, and young adults with congenital valvular AS, an early ejection sound (click) is usually audible, more often along the left sternal border than at the base. Its presence signifies a flexible, noncalcified bicuspid valve (or one of its variants) and localizes the left ventricular outflow obstruction to the valvular (rather than subor supravalvular) level.

The ejection sound is the only right-sided acoustic event that decreases in intensity with inspiration. This phenomenon reflects premature opening of the pulmonic valve by the elevated RV end-diastolic (postatrial a wave) pressure. The systolic murmur increases in intensity during inspiration. With progressively severe PS, the ejection sound moves closer to the first heart sound and eventually

Influenza A and B viruses are major human pathogens and the most extensively studied of the Orthomyxoviridae. Type A and type B viruses are morphologically similar. The virions are irregularly shaped spherical particles, measure 80–120 nm in diameter, and have a lipid envelope from the surface of which the H and N glycoproteins project (Fig. 224-1). The hemagglutinin is the site by which the virus binds to sialic acid cell receptors, whereas the neuraminidase degrades the receptor and plays a role in the release of the virus from infected cells after replication has taken place. Influenza viruses enter cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis, forming a virus-containing endosome. The viral hemagglutinin mediates fusion of the endosomal membrane with the virus envelope, and viral nucleocapsids are subsequently released into the cytoplasm. Immune responses to the H antigen are the major determinants of protection against infection with influenza virus, whereas those to the N antigen limit viral spread and contribute to reduction of the infection. The lipid envelope of influenza A virus also contains the M proteins M1 and M2, which are involved in stabilization of the lipid envelope and in virus assembly. The virion also contains the NP antigen, which is associated with the viral genome, as well as three polymerase (P) proteins that are essential for transcription

and synthesis of viral RNA. Two nonstructural proteins function as an interferon antagonist and posttranscriptional regulator (NS1) and a nuclear export factor (NS2 or NEP).

The genomes of influenza A and B viruses consist of eight single-strand RNA segments, which code for the structural and nonstructural proteins. Because the genome is segmented, the opportunity for gene reassortment during infection is high; reassortment often takes place during infection of cells with more than one influenza A virus.

Certain viruses, such as HSV (Chap. 216), are not completely cleared from the body after infection, but instead enter a latent state; in these cases, clinical latency is accompanied by microbiologic latency. This is not the case with HIV infection as described above. Chronicity associated with persistent virus replication can also be seen in certain cases of HBV and HCV infections (Chap.

document (3) 

Of all the pathogens, DNA viruses that can establish chronic infections have evolved the greatest diversity of mechanisms for subverting or escaping immune defenses. Unlike RNA viruses, DNA viruses have relatively low mutation rates and are thus less able to employ antigenic variation to evade immune defenses. However, because their lower rate of mutation allows them to support much larger genomes, these viruses have been able to accommodate a remarkable number of viral genes encoding proteins that can subvert nearly every aspect of antiviral defense. In the case of poxvirus, adenovirus, and especially herpesviruses, all of them

all of them large DNA viruses that will be our focus here, over 50% of the genome can be dedicated to immune evasionrelated genes. Further, some of these viruses, particularly the herpesviruses, have evolved mechanisms that allow them to enter a state known as latency, in which the virus is not actively replicated. In the latent state, the virus does not cause disease; however, because no viral peptides are produced to load MHC class I molecules that signal the virus’s presence to cytolytic T cells, it cannot be eliminated, and can establish lifelong infections. As we

lifelong infections. As we will discuss in Section 1324, latent infections can be reactivated, resulting in recurrent illness. Of the eight types of herpesvirus that infect humans, at least one of the five most common types—herpes simplex virus (HSV)1 and 2 (both of which can cause labial and genital herpes), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV, which causes infectious mononucleosis), varicellazoster (which causes chickenpox and shingles), and cytomegalovirus (CMV)—infects nine out of ten people, and typically establishes lifelong latency. Here we highlight major mechanisms by which these viruses succeed (Fig. 13.23).

2023-11-29 14:08:53,413 query: A 59-year-old overweight woman presents to the urgent care clinic with the complaint of severe abdominal pain for the past 2 hours. She also complains of a dull pain in her back with nausea and vomiting several times. Her pain has no relation with food. Her past medical history is significant for recurrent abdominal pain due to cholelithiasis. Her father died at the age of 60 with some form of abdominal cancer. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), respirations are 15/min, pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 122/98 mm Hg. Physical exam is unremarkable. However, a CT scan of the abdomen shows a calcified mass near her gallbladder. Which of the following diagnoses should be excluded first in this patient?

A 52-year-old woman visited her family physician with complaints of increasing lethargy and vomiting. The physician examined her and noted that compared to previous visits she had lost significant weight. She was also jaundiced, and on examination of the abdomen a well-defined 10-cm rounded mass was palpable below the liver edge in the right upper quadrant (Fig. 4.185).

The clinical diagnosis was carcinoma of the head of the pancreas.

It is difficult to appreciate how such a precise diagnosis can be made clinically when only three clinical signs have been described.

The patient’s obstruction was in the distal bile duct.

When a patient has jaundice, the causes are excessive breakdown of red blood cells (prehepatic), hepatic failure (hepatic jaundice), and posthepatic causes, which include obstruction along the length of the biliary tree.

The patient had a mass in her right upper quadrant that was palpable below the liver; this was the gallbladder.

In healthy individuals, the gallbladder is not palpable. An expanded gallbladder indicates obstruction either within the cystic duct or below the level of the cystic duct insertion (i.e., the bile duct).

The patient’s vomiting was related to the position of the tumor.

It is not uncommon for vomiting and weight loss (cachexia) to occur in patients with a malignant disease. The head of the pancreas lies within the curve of the duodenum, primarily adjacent to the descending part of the duodenum. Any tumor mass in the region of the head of the pancreas is likely to expand and may encase and invade the duodenum. Unfortunately, in this patient’s case, this happened, producing almost complete obstruction. Further discussion with the patient revealed that she was vomiting relatively undigested food soon after each meal.

A CT scan demonstrated further complications.

document (1) 

The pain is referred.

The visceral afferent (sensory) nerve fibers from the ureter pass into the spinal cord, entering the first and second lumbar segments of the spinal cord. Pain is thus referred to cutaneous regions innervated by somatic sensory nerves from the same spinal cord levels.

The patient was investigated by a CT scan.

Traditionally, a plain radiograph was used to look for the radiopaque stone (90% of renal stones are radiopaque) and this often proceeded to intravenous urography to determine precise location of renal stones. Currently, low-dose CT of the collecting system is used to visualize the renal stones and pinpoint the level of obstruction, using low radiation dose and no intravenous contrast.

An ultrasound scan may also be useful to assess for pelvicaliceal dilation and may reveal stones at the pelviureteral junction or the vesicoureteric junction. Ultrasound is also valuable for assessing other causes of obstruction (e.g., tumors at and around the ureteric orifices in the bladder) and is particularly useful in pregnant women when imaging with the use of radiation is a concern.

Usually an intravenous urogram would be carried out to enable assessment of the upper urinary tracts and precise location of the stone.

Not infrequently, CT scans of the abdomen are also obtained. These scans not only give information about the kidneys, ureters, and bladder but also show the position of the stone and other associated pathology.

If this patient’s infrascapular pain was on the right and predominantly within the right lower abdomen, appendicitis would also have to be excluded. A CT scan would enable differentiation of appendicitis and urinary colic.

A 27-year-old woman was admitted to the surgical ward with appendicitis. She underwent an appendectomy. It was noted at operation that the appendix had perforated and there was pus within the abdominal cavity. The appendix was removed and the stump tied. The abdomen was washed out with warm saline solution. The patient initially made an uneventful recovery, but by day 7 she had become unwell, with pain over her right shoulder and spiking temperatures.

document (2) 

The typical history for appendicitis is a central abdominal, colicky (intermittent waxing and waning) pain, which over a period of hours localizes to become a constant pain in the right iliac fossa. The central colicky pain is typical for a poorly localized visceral type of pain. As the parietal peritoneum becomes inflamed, the pain becomes localized. Although this patient does have right iliac fossa pain, the history is not typical for appendicitis (although it must be remembered that patients may not always have a classical history for appendicitis).

The surgical intern asked a more senior colleague for an opinion.

The senior colleague considered other anatomical structures that lie within the right iliac fossa as a potential cause of pain. These include the appendix, the cecum, and the small bowel. Musculoskeletal pain and referred pain could also be potential causes. In women, pain may also arise from the ovary, fallopian tube, and uterus. In a young patient, diseases of these organs are rare. Infection and pelvic inflammatory disease may occur in the younger patient and need to be considered.

The patient gave no history of these disorders.

Upon further questioning, however, the patient revealed that her last menstrual period was 6 weeks before this examination. The senior physician realized that a potential cause of the abdominal pain was a pregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy). The patient was rushed for an abdominal ultrasound, which revealed no fetus or sac in the uterus. She was also noted to have a positive pregnancy test. The patient underwent surgery and was found to have a ruptured fallopian tube caused by an ectopic pregnancy.

Whenever a patient has apparent pelvic pain, it is important to consider the gender-related anatomical differences. Ectopic pregnancy should always be considered in women of childbearing age.

A 35-year-old woman visited her family practitioner because she had a “bloating” feeling and an increase in abdominal girth. The family practitioner examined the lower abdomen, which revealed a mass that extended from the superior pubic rami to the level of the umbilicus. The superior margin of the mass was easily palpated, but the inferior margin appeared to be less well defined.

IBS is a disorder that affects all ages, although most patients have their first symptoms before age 45. Older individuals have a lower reporting frequency. Women are diagnosed with IBS two to three times as often as men and make up 80% of the population with severe IBS. As indicated in Table 352-1, pain or abdominal discomfort is a key symptom for the diagnosis of IBS. These symptoms should be improved with defecation and/or have their onset associated with a change in frequency or form of stool. Painless diarrhea or constipation does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria to be classified as IBS. Supportive symptoms that are not part of the diagnostic criteria include defecation straining, urgency or a feeling of incomplete bowel movement, passing mucus, and bloating.

Abdominal Pain According to the current IBS diagnostic criteria, abdominal pain or discomfort is a prerequisite clinical feature of IBS. Abdominal pain in IBS is highly variable in intensity and location. It is frequently episodic and crampy, but it may be superimposed on a background of constant ache. Pain may be mild enough to be ignored or it may interfere with daily activities. Despite this, malnutrition due to inadequate caloric intake is exceedingly rare with IBS. Sleep deprivation is also unusual because abdominal pain is almost uniformly present only during waking hours. However, patients with severe IBS frequently wake repeatedly during the night; thus, nocturnal pain is a poor discriminating factor between organic and functional bowel disease. Pain is often exacerbated by eating or emotional stress and improved by passage of flatus or stools. In addition, female patients with IBS commonly report worsening symptoms during the premenstrual and menstrual phases.

2023-11-29 14:08:54,056 query: A 7-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician’s office for a follow-up visit. He was diagnosed with asthma when he was 3 years old and has since been on treatment for the condition. He is currently on a β-agonist inhaler because of exacerbation of his symptoms. He has observed that his symptoms are more prominent in springtime, especially when the new flowers are blooming. His mother has a backyard garden and whenever he goes out to play there, he experiences chest tightness with associated shortness of breath. He has been advised to take more precaution during this seasonal change and to stay away from pollen. He is also being considered for an experimental therapy, which attenuates the activity of certain mediators which cause his asthmatic attack. The targeted mediator favors the class switching of antibodies. A reduction in this mechanism will eventually reduce the exaggerated response observed during his asthmatic attacks, even when exposed to an allergen. Which of the following mediators is described in this experimental study?

Approximately 60% of children with allergic rhinitis have symptoms of reactive airways disease/asthma (see Chapter 78). Chronic allergic inflammation leads to chronic cough from postnasal drip; eustachian tube dysfunction and otitis media; sinusitis; and tonsillar and adenoid hypertrophy, which may lead to obstructive sleep apnea. Children with allergic rhinitis may experience sleep disturbances, limitations of activity, irritability, and mood and cognitive disorders that adversely affect their performance at school and their sense of well-being.

Seasonal allergic rhinitis is a common and prominent condition that may not improve as children grow older. Patients become more adept at self-management. Perennial allergic rhinitis improves with allergen control of indoor allergens.

Removal or avoidance of the offending allergen is advised. The only effective measure for minimizing animal allergens from pets is removal of the pet from the home. Avoidance of pollen and outdoor molds can be accomplished by staying indoors in a controlled environment. Air conditioning and keeping windows and doors closed lower exposure to pollen. High-efficiency particle air filters reduce exposure to allergens (e.g., pet dander). Sealing the mattress, pillow, and covers in allergen-proof encasings is the most effective strategy for reduction of mite allergen. Bedding should be washed in hot water (>130 °F) every week.

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, pruritic, relapsing inflammatory skin condition. The pathogenesis is multifactorial and involves a complex interplay of factors, including genetic predisposition, immunologic abnormalities, disturbances in skin barrier function, environmental interactions, and infectious triggers. Several genes encoding epidermal (filaggrin) or other epithelial structural proteins and genes encoding major elements of the immune system play a major role in atopic dermatitis.

self-management skills. Because many children with asthma have coexisting allergies, steps to minimize allergen exposure should be taken (Table 78-3). For all children with asthma, exposures to tobacco and wood smoke and to persons with viral infections should be minimized. Influenza immunizations are indicated. Asthma medications can be divided into long-term control medications and quick-relief medications.

Inhaled corticosteroids are the most effective anti-inflammatory medications for the treatment of chronic, persistent asthma and are the preferred therapy when initiating longterm control therapy. Early intervention with inhaled corticosteroids reduces morbidity but does not alter the natural history of asthma. Regular use reduces airway hyperreactivity, the need for rescue bronchodilator therapy, risk of hospitalization, and risk of death from asthma. Inhaled corticosteroids are available as an inhalation aerosol, dry powder inhaler, and nebulizer solution.

asthma and allergy. Exacerbating factors include viral infections, exposure to allergens and irritants (e.g., smoke, strong odors, fumes), exercise, emotions, and change in weather/humidity. Nighttime symptoms are common. Rhinosinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (especially aspirin) can aggravate asthma. Treatment of these conditions may lessen the frequency and severity of the asthma.

During acute episodes, tachypnea, tachycardia, cough, wheezing, and a prolonged expiratory phase may be present. Physical findings may be subtle. Classic wheezing may not be prominent if there is poor air movement from airway obstruction. As the attack progresses, cyanosis, diminished air movement, retractions, agitation, inability to speak, tripod sitting position, diaphoresis, and pulsus paradoxus (decrease in blood pressure of >15 mm Hg with inspiration) may be observed. Physical examination may show evidence of other atopic diseases such as eczema or allergic rhinitis.

Objective measurements of pulmonary function (spirometry) help establish the diagnosis and direct the treatment of asthma. Spirometry is used to monitor response to treatment, assess degree of reversibility with therapeutic intervention, and measure the severity of an asthma exacerbation. Children older than 5 years of age can perform spirometry maneuvers. Variability in predicted peak flow reference values make spirometry preferred to peak flow measures in the diagnosis of asthma. For younger children who cannot perform spirometry maneuvers or peak flow, a therapeutic trial of controller medications helps in the diagnosis of asthma.

The risk profile for BRUE in infants remains largely unknown. The pediatrician who saw the boy in the emergency department is trying to identify risk factors for BRUE. She is aware of several confounders, including age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness.

In most cases, a careful history can lead to a correct diagnosis. Questions should include history of premature birth, prior apnea, level of consciousness at the time of the event, presence or absence of respiratory effort, limpness or stiffness, jerking movements (seizure), feeding history, intercurrent illnesses, any trauma, and the social situation of the family. The physical examination should focus on bruising and injury, the general and neurologic condition of the infant, nutritional status, respiratory pattern, and cardiac status. The laboratory evaluation may include serum electrolytes, serum glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell count, a chest radiograph, and blood gas analysis. Testing for respiratory viruses and pertussis in patients with evidence of respiratory infection should occur. If gastroesophageal reflux is suspected, a barium swallow or pH probe study may be useful. Cardiorespiratory monitoring for 12 to 24 hours in the hospital can provide information on respiratory and cardiac patterns and feeding difficulties (choking, gagging, emesis); provide time to get more history and assess the home situation; and alleviate parental anxiety. Useful tests to determine CNS causes include a head computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) (for seizures).

There are no standard recommendations for when home monitoring should be prescribed. Polysomnography is not useful in predicting which children with ALTEs are likely to progress to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The key to prevention of future events is to identify the underlying cause and treat it. Teaching parents infant cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and attempting to alleviate anxiety surrounding the event are recommended.

Diagnosis of Neonatal Metabolic Diseases

An important clue, of course, is provided by the history of a neonatal disease or unexplained death earlier in the same sibship or in a male maternal relative. A history that protein foods are rejected by the infant, or even a history among relatives of a dislike of protein or feeding difficulties in infancy, should raise the suspicion of an inherited hyperammonemic disorder or an organic acidemia. Measurements of blood ammonia and lactate and of the urine for ketones and reducing substances (that react with cupric sulfate) are the key laboratory tests. A wide-spectrum screening program may disclose a biochemical abnormality; this is the optimal state of affairs, especially when this type of screening provides the information before symptoms appear.

A number of nonhereditary metabolic diseases must be distinguished from the hereditary ones in this period of life. Hypocalcemia is one of the most frequent causes of neonatal seizures; tetany, spasms, and tremulous movements are usually present. Its cause is unknown, but the disorder is easily corrected, with excellent prognosis. Symptomatic hypoglycemic reactions are frequent in neonates. Premature infants are the most susceptible. Seizures, tremulousness, and drowsiness occur with blood sugar levels of less than 30 mg/dL in the mature infant, and less than 20 mg/dL in the premature. Maternal toxemia and diabetes mellitus also predispose to hypoglycemia. Other causes of hypoglycemia are adrenal insufficiency, galactosemia, an idiopathic pancreatic islet-cell hyperplasia, the treatable fatty-acid beta-oxidation disorders, and a congenital deficiency of CSF glucose transport— causing persistent hypoglycorrhachia and refractory seizures unless blood glucose levels are kept high. The damaging effects of untreated hypoglycemia were well documented by Koivisto and colleagues. Also now identified is a disorder of CSF serine transport causing failure to thrive, severe developmental disability with spasticity and intractable epilepsy. The diagnosis is made by measuring CSF amino acids; treatment is with high-dose oral serine. Cretinism and idiopathic hypercalcemia are other recognizable entities that appear during this age period.

Fetal anomalies may be detected by ultrasonography. Emphasis should be placed on visualization of the genitourinary tract; the head (for anencephaly or hydrocephaly), neck (for thickened nuchal translucency), and back (for spina bifida); skeleton; gastrointestinal tract; and heart. Four-chamber and great artery views are required for detection of heart anomalies. Chromosomal anomaly syndromes are often associated with an abnormal “triple test” (low estriols, low maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels, and elevated placental chorionic gonadotropin levels). If a fetal abnormality is detected, fetal therapy or delivery with therapy in the neonatal intensive care unit may be lifesaving.

The approach to the birth of an infant requires a detailed history (Table 58-3). Knowing the mother’s risk factors enables the delivery room team to anticipate problems that may occur after birth. The history of a woman’s labor and delivery can reveal events that might lead to complications affecting either the mother or the neonate, even when the pregnancy was previously considered low risk. Anticipating the need to resuscitate a newborn as a result of fetal distress increases the likelihood of successful resuscitation.

The transition from fetal to neonatal physiology occurs at birth. Oxygen transport across the placenta results in a gradient between the maternal and fetal Pao2. Although fetal oxygenated blood has a low Pao2 level compared with that of adults and infants, the fetus is not anaerobic. Fetal oxygen uptake and consumption are similar to neonatal rates, even though the thermal environments and activity levels of fetuses and neonates differ. The oxygen content of fetal blood

Examination of the chest includes inspection of the chest wall to identify asymmetry resulting from absence of the pectoralis muscle and inspection of the breast tissue to determine gestational age and detect a breast abscess. Boys and girls may have breast engorgement and produce milk; milk expression should not be attempted. Supernumerary nipples may be bilateral and may be associated with renal anomalies.

Examination of the lungs includes observations of the rate, depth, and nature of intercostal or sternal retractions. Breath sounds should be equal on both sides of the chest, and rales should not be heard after the first 1 to 2 hours of life. Diminished or absent breath sounds on one side suggest pneumothorax, collapsed lung, pleural effusion, or diaphragmatic hernia. Shift of the cardiac impulse away from a tension pneumothorax and diaphragmatic hernia and toward the collapsed lung is a helpful physical finding for differentiating these disorders. Subcutaneous emphysema of the neck or chest also suggests a pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum, whereas bowel sounds auscultated in the chest in the presence of a scaphoid abdomen suggest a diaphragmatic hernia.

The position of the heart in infants is more midline than in older children. The first heart sound is normal, whereas the second heart sound may not be split in the first day of life. Decreased splitting of the second heart sound is noted in PPHN, transposition of the great vessels, and pulmonary atresia. Heart murmurs in newborns are common in the delivery room and during the first day of life. Most of these murmurs are transient and are due to closure of the ductus arteriosus, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, or a small ventral septal defect. Pulses should be palpated in the upper and lower extremities (over the brachial and femoral arteries). Blood pressure in the upper and lower extremities should be measured in all patients with a murmur or heart failure. An upperto-lower extremity gradient of more than 10 to 20 mm Hg suggests coarctation of the aorta.

The pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P2) also is often accentuated with elevated PA pressures, and the two components of the second heart sound (S2) are closely split. The opening snap (OS) of the mitral valve is most readily audible in expiration at, or just medial to, the cardiac apex. This sound generally follows the sound of aortic valve closure (A2) by 0.05–0.12 s. The time interval between A2 and OS varies inversely with the severity of the MS. The OS is followed by a low-pitched, rumbling, diastolic murmur, heard best at the apex with the patient in the left lateral recumbent position (see Fig. 267-5); it is accentuated by mild exercise (e.g., a few rapid sit-ups) carried out just before auscultation. In general, the duration of this murmur correlates with the severity of the stenosis in patients with preserved CO. In patients with sinus rhythm, the murmur often reappears or becomes louder during atrial systole (presystolic accentuation). Soft, grade I or II/VI systolic murmurs are commonly heard at the apex or along the left sternal border in patients with pure MS and do not necessarily signify the presence of MR. Hepatomegaly, ankle edema, ascites, and pleural effusion, particularly in the right pleural cavity, may occur in patients with MS and RV failure.

History and Physical Examination The chest discomfort, often severe enough to be described as frank pain, is typically located in the sub-sternal region or sometimes in the epigastrium, and radiates to the left arm, left shoulder, and/or neck. Anginal “equivalents” such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension.

Electrocardiogram ST-segment depression occurs in 20 to 25% of patients; it may be transient in patients without biomarker evidence of myocardial necrosis, but may be persistent for several days in NSTEMI. T-wave changes are common but are less specific signs of ischemia, unless they are new and deep T-wave inversions (≥0.3 mV).

Metabolic derangements are common causes of altered mental status. Disturbances of blood chemistries (glucose, sodium, calcium, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, ammonia) may produce depressed mental status. Metabolic causes of acute coma are suggested by spontaneous fluctuations in the level of consciousness, tremors, myoclonus, asterixis, visual and tactile hallucinations, and deep coma with preservation of pupillary light reflexes. Acute metabolic or toxic disorders usually produce a hypotonic, limp state, but hypertonia, rigidity, and decorticate and decerebrate posturing are sometimes observed in coma caused by hypoglycemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and short-acting barbiturates. A subacute course of somnolence progressing to difficulty arousing from a deep sleep (stupor) over hours suggests drug intoxication or organ system failure (kidney, liver) producing a metabolic encephalopathy. Care must be taken to investigate background medical conditions that may produce a decline in consciousness (e.g., diabetes mellitus, leukemia, kidney failure, liver disease). Intoxication and ingestion are common causes of acute alteration of consciousness, and a thorough history must be taken to search for the offending agent (Chapter 45). A history of social and emotional difficulties, drug abuse, or depression raises concern for self-inflicted injury or toxic ingestion.

Central nervous system infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis, usually causes abrupt alteration of mental status, althoughviral meningoencephalitis (particularly herpes simplex virus) canpresent with subacute alterations in mental status. The presenceof fever, petechiae, chills, and sweats suggests infection. Prodromal photophobia and pain on movement of the head or eyes aresymptoms of meningeal irritation. Premonitory symptoms, suchas abdominal pain, diarrhea, sore throat, conjunctivitis, cough, orrash, point toward viral encephalitis or a postinfectious syndromeas the cause of the altered consciousness.

Anxiety disorder is a chronic state, some would say a disease, punctuated by recurrent attacks of acute anxiety or panic. The acute attacks are the hallmark of the disease and some psychiatrists are reluctant to make a diagnosis of anxiety neurosis in their absence. Because of the clinical features of panic attacks and particularly their episodic nature, simulating an acute medical condition, they are of special interest to neurologists and general physicians. While anxiety may be inferred from observing the activities of young children, and is reported as a form of nervousness by older children and adolescents, more often there are physical complaints at times of transition or stress during the day or year.

Panic attacks in their full form are prone to begin after this age and are almost as dramatic as seizures. They often begin with distressing feelings of dread and foreboding. The patient is assailed by a sense of strangeness, as though his body had changed or the surroundings were unreal. He is frightened, sometimes by the prospect of imminent death (angor animi) or of losing his mind or self-control. There may be a feeling of smothering. “I am dying” or “I can’t breathe” are characteristic expressions of alarm and panic. The heart races, breathing comes in rapid gasps, the pupils may be dilated, and the patient may sweat or tremble. The palpitation and breathing difficulties are so prominent that a cardiologist is often consulted. Some of our psychiatric colleagues identify breathlessness or a suffocating feeling as central to the diagnosis of panic (and attribute psychologic meaning to the symptom), but this is not sustained in our observations of affected patients. The symptoms abate spontaneously after 15 to 30 min, leaving the patient shaken, tense, perplexed, and often embarrassed. There is no confusion, and after the episode there is full memory of the event.

document (2) 

The symptoms of anxiety may be manifest either in acute episodes, each lasting several minutes or up to an hour, or as a protracted state that may last for weeks, months, or years. In the panic attack, the patient is suddenly overwhelmed by feelings of apprehension, or a fear that he may lose consciousness and die, have a heart attack or stroke, lose his reason or self-control, become insane, or commit some horrible crime. These experiences are accompanied by a series of physiologic reactions, mainly sympathoadrenal hyperactivity, resembling the “fight-or-flight” reaction. Breathlessness, a feeling of suffocation, dizziness, sweating, trembling, palpitation, and precordial or gastric distress are typical but not invariable physical accompaniments. As a persistent and less-severe state, the patient experiences fluctuating degrees of nervousness, palpitation or excessive cardiac impulse, shortness of breath, light-headedness, faintness, easy fatigue, and intolerance of physical exertion.

Attacks tend to occur during periods of relative calm and in nonthreatening circumstances. Usually, the apprehension and physical symptoms escalate over a period of minutes to an hour and then abate over 20 to 30 min, leaving the patient tired, weak, and perplexed. The dramatic symptoms of the panic attack have usually abated by the time the patient reaches a doctor’s office or an emergency department, but the blood pressure may still be elevated, and there may be tachycardia. Otherwise, the patient looks remarkably collected. Often, discrete anxiety attacks and persistent states of anxiety merge with one another. The fear of further attacks leads many patients, particularly women, to become agoraphobic and homebound, fearing public places, especially if alone.

The diagnosis is one of exclusion, and care should be taken to ensure that patients do not have intermittent dizziness due to TIA. In patients < 50 years of age, a history of recent trauma or of severe, abrupt-onset, or persistent pain (> 72 hours) should raise concern for vertebral artery dissection with TIAs.

A brain MRI with vascular imaging (e.g., MRA) is sometimes indicated to assess potential intracranial pathology, particularly cerebrovascular disease.

Episodic ataxia type 2 can be corroborated by genetic testing.

Tx: Can usually be prevented through migraine medication, diet, or lifestyle changes. Benzodiazepines or antiemetics may be tried. Surgical therapies are not indicated.

One of the most common causes of loss of consciousness 2° to an abrupt drop in cerebral perfusion. Etiologies include cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac outﬂow obstruction, vasovagal syncope, orthostatic hypotension, micturition-related syncope, basilar TIAs, and idiopathic causes. Presyncope is described as a feeling of imminent loss of consciousness without actual fainting. Commonly confused with seizures.

Hx/PE:

Patients may report a trigger (e.g., standing for long period of time, fear/sight of blood, Valsalva maneuver).

Ménière’s disease consists of recurrent episodes, but unlike BPPV, these usually last hours to days.

Unlike Ménière’s, vestibular migraine usually has no associated auditory or aural symptoms.

Rule out vertebral artery dissection in those with persistent head or neck pain and intermittent isolated dizziness or vertigo.

■Typically follows a prodrome of lightheadedness or dizziness, muff ed sounds, constricting vision, diffuse weakness, diaphoresis, or pallor. Leads to loss of consciousness and muscle tone for < 30 seconds and recovery within seconds.

The diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma can be made accurately by an expert hematopathologist (Fig. 134-8). Cytogenetic and molecular genetic studies are not necessary for diagnosis, but some evidence has accumulated that patients whose tumors overexpress the BCL-2 protein might be more likely to relapse than others. A subset of patients have tumors with mutations in BCL6 and translocations involving MYC; these are called “double-hit” lymphomas and typically have more aggressive growth and are more poorly responsive to treatment than other diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Patients with prominent mediastinal involvement are sometimes diagnosed as a separate subgroup having primary mediastinal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This latter group of patients has a younger median age (i.e., 37 years) and a female predominance (66%). Subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, including those with an immunoblastic subtype and tumors with extensive fibrosis, are recognized by pathologists but do not appear to have important independent prognostic significance.

FIGURE 134-8 Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The neoplastic cells are heterogeneous but predominantly large cells with vesicular chro-matin and prominent nucleoli.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma can present as either primary lymph node disease or at extranodal sites. More than 50% of patients will have some site of extranodal involvement at diagnosis, with the most common sites being the gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow, each being involved in 15–20% of patients. Essentially any organ can be involved, making a diagnostic biopsy imperative. For example, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the pancreas has a much better prognosis than pancreatic carcinoma but would be missed without biopsy. Primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the brain is being diagnosed with increasing frequency. Other unusual subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma such as pleural effusion lymphoma and intravascular lymphoma have been difficult to diagnose and associated with a very poor prognosis.

Nodal Marginal Zone B-Cell Lymphoma This rare node-based disease bears an uncertain relationship with extranodal marginal zone lymphomas, which are often mucosa-associated and are called mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas, and SMZLs. Patients may have localized or generalized adenopathy. The neoplastic cell is a marginal zone B cell with monocytoid features and has been called monocytoid B-cell lymphoma in the past. Up to one-third of the patients may have extranodal involvement, and involvement of the lymph nodes can be secondary to the spread of a mucosal primary lesion. In authentic nodal primaries, the cytogenetic abnormalities associated with MALT lymphomas [trisomy 3 and t(11;18)] are very rare. The clinical course is indolent. Patients often respond to combination chemotherapy, although remissions have not been durable. Few patients have received CHOP plus rituximab, which is likely to be an effective approach to management.

Mediastinal (Thymic) Large B-Cell Lymphoma This entity was originally considered a subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; however, additional study has identified it as a distinct entity with its own characteristic clinical, genetic, and immunophenotypic features. This is a disease that can be bulky in size but usually remains confined to the mediastinum. It can be locally aggressive, including progressing to produce a superior vena cava obstruction syndrome or pericardial effusion. About one-third of patients develop pleural effusions, and 5–10% can disseminate widely to kidney, adrenal, liver, skin, and even brain. The disease affects women more often than men (male-to-female ratio is 1:2–3), and the median age is 35–40 years.

The tumor is composed of sheets of large cells with abundant cytoplasm accompanied by variable, but often abundant, fibrosis.

Intravascular Large B-Cell Lymphoma This is an extremely rare form of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma characterized by the presence of lymphoma in the lumen of small vessels, particularly capillaries. It is also known as malignant angioendotheliomatosis or angiotropic large cell lymphoma. It is sufficiently rare that no consistent picture has emerged to define a clinical syndrome or its epidemiologic and genetic features. It is thought to remain inside vessels because of a defect in adhesion molecules and homing mechanisms, an idea supported by scant data suggesting absence of expression of β-1 integrin and ICAM-1. Patients commonly present with symptoms of small-vessel occlusion, skin lesions, or neurologic symptoms. The tumor cell clusters can promote thrombus formation. In general, the clinical course is aggressive and the disease is poorly responsive to therapy. Often a diagnosis is not made until very late in the course of the disease.

Primary Effusion Lymphoma This entity is another variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that presents with pleural effusions, usually without apparent tumor mass lesions. It is most common in the setting of immune deficiency disease, especially AIDS, and is caused by human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8)/Kaposi’s sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV). It is also known as body cavity–based lymphoma. Some patients have been previously diagnosed with Kaposi’s sarcoma. It can also occur in the absence of immunodeficiency in elderly men of Mediterranean heritage, similar to Kaposi’s sarcoma but even less common.

As already mentioned, the deaf child makes the transition from crying to cooing and babbling at the usual age of 3 to 5 months. After the sixth month, however, the child becomes much quieter, and the usual repertoire of babbling sounds becomes stereotyped and unchanging, though still uttered with pleasant voice. A more conspicuous failure comes somewhat later, when babbling fails to give way to word formation. Should deafness develop within the first few years of life, the child gradually loses such speech as had been acquired but can be retaught by the lipreading method. Speech, however, is harsh, poorly modulated, and unpleasant, and accompanied by many peculiar squeals and snorting or grunting noises. Social and other acquisitions appear at the expected times in the congenitally deaf child, unlike in the developmentally delayed child. The deaf child seems eager to communicate and makes known all his needs by gesture or pantomime, often very cleverly. The deaf child may attract attention by vivid facial expressions, motions of the lips, nodding, or head shaking. The Leiter performance scale, which makes no use of sounds, will show that intelligence is normal. Deafness can be demonstrated at an early age by careful observation of the child’s responses to sounds and by free-field audiometry, but the full range of hearing cannot be accurately tested before the age of 3 or 4 years. Recording of brainstem auditory evoked potentials and testing of the labyrinths, which are frequently unresponsive in deaf mutes, may be helpful. Early diagnosis is important so as to fit the child with a hearing aid and to begin appropriate language training.

In contrast to the child in whom deafness is the only abnormality, the developmentally delayed child generally talks little but may display a rich personality. Autistic children may also be mute; if they speak, echolalia is prominent and the personal “I” is avoided. Blind children of normal intelligence tend to speak slowly and fail to acquire imitative gestures.

bleeding from these structures can be fatal. The anterior margin is often apparent, while the posterior muscular rim is attenuated. If the infant is heparinized on bypass, minimal dissection of the muscular margins is per-formed. Electrocautery is used liberally to minimize postopera-tive bleeding. Most infants who require ECMO support prior to hernia repair have large defects, often lacking the medial and posterior margins. About three-fourths of infants repaired on bypass require prosthetic material to patch the defect, suturing it to the diaphragmatic remnant or around ribs or costal cartilages for the large defects.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) occurs when GERleads to troublesome symptoms or complications such as poorgrowth, pain, or breathing difficulties. GERD occurs in a minorityof infants but is often implicated as the cause of fussiness. GERDis seen in fewer than 5% of older children. In older children, normal protective mechanisms against GER include antegradeesophageal motility, tonic contraction of the LES, and the geometry of the gastroesophageal junction. Abnormalities that causeGER in older children and adults include reduced tone of the LES, transient relaxations of the LES, esophagitis (which impairsesophageal motility), increased intra-abdominal pressure, cough,respiratory difficulty (asthma or cystic fibrosis), and hiatal hernia.

Cough Hoarseness Wheezing Abdominal Pain Failure to Thrive

The presence of GER is easy to observe in an infant who spits up. In older children, the refluxate is usually kept down by reswallowing, but GER may be suspected by associated symptoms, such as heartburn, cough, epigastric abdominal pain, dysphagia, wheezing, aspiration pneumonia, hoarse voice, failure to thrive, and recurrent otitis media or sinusitis. In severe cases of esophagitis, there may be laboratory evidence of anemia and hypoalbuminemia secondary to esophageal bleeding and inflammation.

When esophagitis develops as a result of acid reflux, esophageal motility and LES function are impaired further, creating a cycle of reflux and esophageal injury.

Chronic cough is defined as a daily cough lasting longer than 3 weeks. Common causes of chronic cough are asthma, postnasal drip (allergic rhinitis, sinusitis), and postinfectious tussive syndromes. It can also be caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease, swallowing dysfunction (infants), anatomic abnormalities (tracheoesophageal fistula, tracheomalacia), and chronic infection. Persistent cough may also be caused by exposure to irritants (tobacco and wood stove smoke) or foreign body aspiration, or it may be psychogenic in origin.

During the first several years of life, children experience frequent viral respiratory infections, especially if they have multiple older siblings or attend day care or preschool. Cough that resolves promptly and is clearly associated with a viral infection does not require further diagnostic workup. However, cough persisting longer than 3 weeks warrants further evaluation.

Chest radiographs are useful in assessing respiratory disease in children. In addition to determining lung abnormalities, they provide information about the bony thorax (rib or vertebral abnormalities), the heart (cardiomegaly, pericardial effusion), and the great vessels (right aortic arch/vascular rings, rib notching). Chest radiographs should be obtained in both the posteroanterior (PA) and lateral projections and, if possible, following a full inspiration. Estimation of lung hyperinflation based on a single PA view is unreliable; flattened diaphragms and an increased AP diameter on lateral projection is a better indicator of hyperinflation. Crowding of the blood vessels with poor inspiration can be misinterpreted as increased markings or infiltrates. External skin folds, rotation, and motion may produce distorted or unclear images. Expiratory views and fluoroscopy may detect partial bronchial obstruction due to an aspirated foreign body that results in regional hyperinflation, because the affected lung or lobe does not deflate on exhalation. Fluoroscopy can also be used to evaluate diaphragm movement.

document (2) 

Antigen tests (usually by immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [also referred to as ELISA]) of nasopharyngeal secretions for RSV, parainfluenza viruses, influenza viruses, and adenoviruses are sensitive tests to confirm the infection. Rapid viral diagnosis also is performed by polymerase chain reaction. Identifying the viral agent is helpful for cohorting children with the same infection but is not necessary to make the diagnosis of bronchiolitis.

Chest radiographs frequently show signs of lung hyperinflation, including increased lung lucency and flattened or depressed diaphragms. Areas of increased density may represent either viral pneumonia or localized atelectasis.

The major difficulty in the diagnosis of bronchiolitis is to differentiate other diseases associated with wheezing. It may be difficult to differentiate asthma from bronchiolitis by physical examination, but age of presentation, presence of fever, and absence of personal or family history of asthma are the major differential factors. Bronchiolitis occurs primarily in the first year of life and is accompanied by fever, whereas asthma usually presents in older children with previous wheezing episodes typically unaccompanied by fever unless a respiratory tract infection is the trigger for the asthma exacerbation.

Wheezing also may be due to an airway foreign body, congenital airway obstructive lesion, cystic fibrosis, exacerbation of chronic lung disease, viral or bacterial pneumonia, and other lower respiratory tract diseases (see Chapter 78). Cardiogenic asthma, which can be confused with bronchiolitis in infants, is wheezing associated with pulmonary congestion secondary to left-sided heart failure.

Wheezing associated with gastroesophageal reflux is likely to be chronic or recurrent, and the patient may have a history of frequent emesis. Cystic fibrosis is associated with poor growth, chronic diarrhea, and a positive family history. A focal area on radiography that does not inflate or deflate suggests foreign body aspiration.

Chronic bronchitis is diagnosed on clinical grounds: it is defined by the presence of a persistent productive cough for at least 3 consecutive months in at least 2 consecutive years. It is common among cigarette smokers and urban dwellers in smog-ridden cities; some studies indicate that 20% to 25% of men in the 40to 65-year-old age group have the disease. In early stages of the disease, the cough raises mucoid sputum, but airflow is not obstructed. Some patients with chronic bronchitis have evidence of hyperresponsive airways, with intermittent bronchospasm and wheezing (asthmatic bronchitis), while other bronchitic patients, especially heavy smokers, develop chronic outflow obstruction, usually with associated emphysema (COPD).

The distinctive feature of chronic bronchitis is hypersecretion of mucus, beginning in the large airways.

The incidence of bacterial meningitis is highest among children under 1 year of age. Extremely high rates are found in Native Americans, Alaskan Natives, and Australian aboriginals, suggesting that genetic factors play a role in susceptibility. Other risk factors include acquired or congenital immunodeficiencies, hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease, functional or anatomic asplenia, and crowding such as occurs in some households, day care centers, or college and military dormitories. A CSF leak (fistula), resulting from congenital anomaly or following a basilar skull fracture, increases the risk of meningitis, especially that caused by S. pneumoniae.

Enteroviruses and parechoviruses cause meningitis with peaks during summer and fall in temperate climates. These infections are more prevalent among low socioeconomic groups, young children, and immunocompromised persons. The prevalence of arboviral meningitis is determined by geographic distribution and seasonal activity of the arthropod (mosquito) vectors. In the United States, most arboviral infections occur during the summer and fall.

In nosocomial pneumonia, 60% to 70% of the organisms are gram-negative bacteria. Immunosuppressed patients may develop abscesses because of the usual pathogens as well as less virulent and opportunistic organisms such as Salmonella species, Legionella species, Pneumocystis carinii, atypical mycobacteria, and fungi.Clinical Features and Diagnosis The typical presentation may include productive cough, fever (>38.9°C), chills, leuko-cytosis

Pulmonary involvement is frequently prominent; 35% of patients have a hacking, nonproductive cough, and 23% of patients who undergo chest radiography have pulmonary densities due to interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and pleural effusions. Bibasilar rales are the most common pulmonary sign. Less common clinical manifestations include abdominal pain, confusion, stupor, seizures, ataxia, coma, and jaundice. Clinical laboratory studies frequently reveal anemia and leukopenia early in the course, leukocytosis late in the course, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, hypoalbuminemia, mildly increased serum hepatic aminotransferases, and prerenal azotemia. Complications can include respiratory failure, hematemesis, cerebral hemorrhage, and hemolysis. Severe illness necessitates the admission of 10% of hospitalized patients to an intensive care unit. Greater severity is generally associated with old age, underlying disease, and treatment with a sulfonamide; the case-fatality rate is 1%. In a study of children with murine typhus, 50% suffered only nocturnal fevers, feeling well enough for active daytime play.

Diagnosis and Treatment Serologic studies of acuteand convalescent-phase sera can provide a diagnosis, and an immunohistochemical method for identification of typhus group-specific antigens in biopsy samples has been developed. Cultivation and PCR are used only infrequently and are not widely available. Nevertheless, most patients are treated empirically with doxycycline (100 mg bid orally for 7–15 days) on the basis of clinical suspicion. Ciprofloxacin provides an alternative if doxycycline is contraindicated.

Bronchiolitis treatment consists of supportive therapy, including respiratory monitoring, control of fever, hydration, upper airway suctioning, and, if needed, oxygen administration. Indications for hospitalization include moderate to marked respiratory distress, hypoxemia, apnea, inability to tolerate oral feeding, and lack of appropriate care available at home. Hospitalization of high-risk children with bronchiolitis should be considered. Among hospitalized infants, supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula is often necessary, but intubation and ventilatory assistance for respiratory failure or apnea are required in fewer than 10% of these infants. Bronchodilators and corticosteroids are seldom effective and are not generally recommended.

Most hospitalized children show marked improvement in 2 to 5 days with supportive treatment alone. The course of the wheezing phase varies, however. Tachypnea and hypoxia may progress to respiratory failure requiring assisted ventilation. Apnea is a major concern for very young infants with bronchiolitis.

Most cases of bronchiolitis resolve completely, although minor abnormalities of pulmonary function and bronchial hyperreactivity may persist for several years. Recurrence is common but tends to be mild and should be assessed and treated similarly to the first episode. The incidence of asthma seems to be higher for children hospitalized for bronchiolitis as infants, but it is unclear whether this is causal or whether children prone to asthma are more likely to be hospitalized with bronchiolitis. There is a 1% to 2% mortality rate, highest among infants with preexisting cardiopulmonary or immunologic impairment.

Monthly injections of palivizumab, an RSV-specific monoclonal antibody, initiated just before the onset of the RSV season confers some protection from severe RSV disease. Palivizumab is indicated for some infants under 2 years old with chronic lung disease, very low birth weight, and those with hemodynamically significant cyanotic and acyanotic congenital heart disease. Immunization with influenza vaccine is recommended for all children older than 6 months and may prevent influenza-associated disease.

If the heart rate remains � 100 bpm after 5 to 10 positive pressure breaths, the attempted ventilation is inadequate and corrective steps must be taken. These can be remembered by the pneumonic MR. SOPA (Table 32-1). The two most common problems are mask leak due to an inefective seal and malposition of the airway (Schmolzer, 2011). If corrective steps do not improve the heart rate, either intubation with an endotracheal tube or placement of a laryngeal mask airway is required.

If mask ventilation is inefective or prolonged, an alternative airway is placed. For tracheal intubation, a laryngoscope with a straight blade-size 0 for a preterm newborn and size 1 for a term neonate-is used. Gentle cricoid pressure may be useful. An increasing heart rate and ETC02 detection after several breaths are the primary methods of conirming intubation of the trachea and not the esophagus. One can also look for symmetrical chest wall motion; auscultate for equal breath sounds, especially in the axillae; and auscultate for the absence of breath sounds or gurgling over the stomach.

Once in place, the tube is used for tracheal suctioning only for a suspected obstructed airway. Otherwise, an appropriate positive-pressure device is attached to the endotracheal tube. Air pufs are delivered at a rate of 40 to 60 per minute with a force adequate to stabilize the heart rate. In term infants, opening pressures of 30 to 40 cm H20 typically will expand the alveoli without causing barotrauma. Once the lung is inflated, less pressure is typically needed (20 to 25 cm

H20). For preterm infants, pressures of 20 to 25 cm

Bronchiolitis is a leading cause of hospitalization of infants. Bronchiolitis occurs almost exclusively during the first 2 years of life, with a peak age at 2 to 6 months. Many healthy children with bronchiolitis can be managed as outpatients; however, premature infants and children with chronic lung disease of prematurity, hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease, neuromuscular weakness, or immunodeficiency are at increased risk of severe, potentially fatal disease. Children acquire infection after exposure to infected family members, who typically have symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection, or from infected children in day care. In the United States, annual peaks are usually in the late winter months from December through March.

Bronchiolitis caused by RSV has an incubation period of 4 to6 days. Bronchiolitis classically presents as a progressive respiratory illness similar to the common cold in its early phasewith cough and rhinorrhea. It progresses over 3 to 7 days tonoisy, raspy breathing and audible wheezing. There is usually a low-grade fever accompanied by irritability, which mayreflect the increased work of breathing. In contrast to the classic progression of disease, young infants infected with RSV may not have a prodrome and may have apnea as the first signof infection.

Physical signs of bronchiolar obstruction include prolongation of the expiratory phase of breathing, nasal flaring, intercostal retractions, suprasternal retractions, and air trapping with hyperexpansion of the lungs. During the wheezing phase, percussion of the chest usually reveals only hyperresonance, but auscultation usually reveals diffuse wheezes and crackles throughout the breathing cycle. With more severe disease, grunting and cyanosis may be present.

Routine laboratory tests are not required to confirm the diagnosis. It is important to assess oxygenation in severe cases of bronchiolitis. Pulse oximetry is adequate for monitoring oxygen saturation. Frequent, regular assessments and cardiorespiratory monitoring of infants are necessary because respiratory failure may develop precipitously in very tired infants even though blood gas values taken before rapid decompensation are reassuring.

Predominantly a clinical diagnosis; routine cases do not need blood work or a CXR.

CXR may be obtained to rule out pneumonia and may show hyperinﬂ ation of the lungs with ﬂattened diaphragms, interstitial infiltrates, and atelectasis.

Nasopharyngeal aspirate to test for RSV is highly sensitive and specific but has little effect on management (infants should be treated for bronchiolitis regardless of whether RSV is or not).

Treatment is primarily supportive; treat mild disease with outpatient management using ﬂuids and nebulizers if needed.

Hospitalize in the setting of marked respiratory distress, O2 saturation of < 92%, toxic appearance, dehydration/poor oral feeding, a history of prematurity (< 34 weeks), age < 3 months, underlying cardiopulmonary disease, or unreliable parents.

Treat inpatients with contact isolation, hydration, and O2. A trial of aerosolized albuterol may be attempted; continue albuterol therapy only if effective.

RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis.

Ribavirin is an antiviral drug that has a controversial role in bronchiolitis treatment. It is sometimes used in high-risk infants with underlying heart, lung, or immune disease.

RSV prophylaxis with injectable polyor monoclonal antibodies (RespiGam or Synagis) is recommended in winter for high-risk patients ≤ 2 years of age (e.g., those with a history of prematurity, chronic lung disease, or congenital heart disease).

An acute viral inﬂammatory disease of the larynx, primarily within the subglottic space. Pathogens include parainf uenza virus type 1 (most common), 2, and 3; RSV; inﬂuenza; and adenovirus. Bacterial superinfection may progress to tracheitis.

Prodromal URI symptoms are typically followed by low-grade fever, mild dyspnea, inspiratory stridor that worsens with agitation, a hoarse voice, and a characteristic barking cough (usually at night).

Overwhelming Infection in Asplenic Patients (See also Chap. 325)

Patients without splenic function are at risk for overwhelming bacterial sepsis. Asplenic adult patients succumb to sepsis at 58 times the rate of the general population. Most infections are thought to occur within the first 2 years after splenectomy, with a mortality rate of ~50%, but the increased risk persists throughout life. In asplenia, encapsulated bacteria cause the majority of infections. Adults, who are more likely to have antibody to these organisms, are at lower risk than children. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common isolate, causing 50–70% of cases, but the risk of infection with Haemophilus influenzae or Neisseria meningitidis is also high. Severe clinical manifestations of infections due to E. coli, S. aureus, group B streptococci,

P. aeruginosa, Bordetella holmesii, and Capnocytophaga, Babesia, and Plasmodium species have been described.

Cause of Pneumonia microscopic and microbiologic evaluation of the fluid obtained by endoscopic bronchial lavage is often diagnostic. Lavage fluid should be cultured for Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Legionella, Nocardia, more common bacterial pathogens, fungi, and viruses. In addition, the possibility of Pneumocystis pneumonia should be considered, especially in patients with ALL or lymphoma who have not received prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). The characteristics of the infiltrate may be helpful in decisions about further diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers. Nodular infiltrates suggest fungal pneumonia (e.g., that caused by Aspergillus or Mucor). Such lesions may best be approached by visualized biopsy procedures. It is worth noting that while bacterial pneumonias classically present as lobar infiltrates in normal hosts, bacterial pneumonias in granulocytopenic hosts present with a paucity of signs, symptoms, or radiographic abnormalities; thus, the diagnosis is difficult.

Aspergillus species (Chap. 241) can colonize the skin and respiratory tract or cause fatal systemic illness. Although this fungus may cause aspergillomas in a previously existing cavity or may produce allergic bronchopulmonary disease in some patients, the major problem posed by this genus in neutropenic patients is invasive disease, primarily due to Aspergillus fumigatus or Aspergillus flavus. The organisms enter the host following colonization of the respiratory tract, with subsequent invasion of blood vessels. The disease is likely to present as a thrombotic or embolic event because of this ability of the fungi to invade blood vessels. The risk of infection with Aspergillus correlates directly with the duration of neutropenia. In prolonged neutropenia, positive surveillance cultures for nasopharyngeal colonization with Aspergillus may predict the development of disease.

Parainfluenza virus infections occur most frequently among children, in whom initial infection with serotype 1, 2, or 3 is associated with an acute febrile illness in 50–80% of cases. Children may present with coryza, sore throat, hoarseness, and cough that may or may not be croupy. In severe croup, fever persists, with worsening coryza and sore throat. A brassy or barking cough may progress to frank stridor. Most children recover over the next 1 or 2 days, although progressive airway obstruction and hypoxia ensue occasionally. If bronchiolitis or pneumonia develops, progressive cough accompanied by wheezing, tachypnea, and intercostal retractions may occur. In this setting, sputum production increases modestly. Physical examination documents nasopharyngeal discharge and oropharyngeal injection, along with rhonchi, wheezes, or coarse breath sounds. Chest x-rays can show air trapping and occasionally interstitial infiltrates.

In older children and adults, parainfluenza infections tend to be milder, presenting most frequently as a common cold or as hoarseness, with or without cough. Lower respiratory tract involvement in older children and adults is uncommon, although tracheobronchitis and community-acquired pneumonia have been reported in adults.

Parainfluenza viruses, most frequently type 3, are important pathogens in immunosuppressed patients—particularly in HSCT recipients but also in SOT recipients (especially recipients of lung transplants). Patients receiving cancer chemotherapy are also at risk for severe parainfluenza infection. Severe, prolonged, and even fatal parainfluenzaassociated respiratory illnesses have been reported in children and adults with severe immunosuppression.

The manifestations of croup are a harsh cough described as barking or brassy, hoarseness, inspiratory stridor, low-grade fever, and respiratory distress that may develop slowly or quickly. Stridor is a harsh, high-pitched respiratory sound produced by turbulent airflow. It is usually inspiratory, but it may be biphasic and is a sign of upper airway obstruction. Signs of upper airway obstruction, such as labored breathing and marked suprasternal, intercostal, and subcostal retractions, may be evident on examination (see Chapter 135). Wheezing may be present if there is associated lower airway involvement.

Anteroposterior radiographs of the neck often show the diagnostic subglottic narrowing of croup known as the steeple sign (Fig. 107-1). Routine laboratory studies are not useful in establishing the diagnosis. Leukocytosis is uncommon and suggests epiglottitis or bacterial tracheitis. Many rapid tests (using polymerase chain reaction or fluorescent antibodies) are available for parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and other less common viral causes of croup, such as influenza and adenoviruses.

The diagnosis of croup usually is established by clinical manifestations. The infectious differential diagnosis includes epiglottitis, bacterial tracheitis, and parapharyngeal abscess. Noninfectious causes of stridor include mechanical and anatomic causes (foreign body aspiration, laryngomalacia, subglottic stenosis, hemangioma, vascular ring, vocal cord paralysis). Stridor in infants younger than 4 months of age or persistence of symptoms for longer than 1 week indicates an increased probability of another lesion and the need for imaging and direct laryngoscopy (see Chapter 135).

Cough results from stimulation of irritant receptors in the airway mucosa. Acute cough generally is associated with respiratory infections or irritant exposure (smoke) and subsides as the infection resolves or the exposure is eliminated. The characteristics of the cough and the circumstances under which the cough occurs help in determining the cause. Sudden onset after a choking episode suggests foreign body aspiration. Morning cough may be due to the accumulation of excessive secretions during the night from sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, or bronchial infection. Nighttime coughing is a hallmark of asthma and can also be caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease. Cough exacerbated by lying flat may be due to postnasal drip, sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, or reflux. Recurrent coughing with exercise is suggestive of exercise-induced asthma/bronchospasm. Paroxysmal cough suggests pertussis or foreign body aspiration. A repetitive, staccato cough occurs in chlamydial infections in infants. A harsh, brassy, seal-like cough suggests croup, tracheomalacia, or psychogenic (habit) cough. The last, which is most common in teenagers, disappears during sleep. Younger children can develop a throat-clearing habit cough, which also disappears during sleep.

The Gonadal Hormones & Inhibitors

George P. Chrousos, MD

A 25-year-old woman with menarche at 13 years and menstrual periods until about 1 year ago complains of hot flushes, skin and vaginal dryness, weakness, poor sleep, and scanty and infrequent menstrual periods of a year’s dura-tion. She visits her gynecologist, who obtains plasma levels of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, both of which are moderately elevated. She is diagnosed with premature ovarian failure, and estrogen and pro-gesterone replacement therapy is recommended. A dual-energy absorptiometry scan (DEXA) reveals a bone density t-score of <2.5 SD, ie, frank osteoporosis. How should the ovarian hormones she lacks be replaced? What extra mea-sures should she take for her osteoporosis while receiving treatment?

■ THE OVARY (ESTROGENS, PROGESTINS, OTHER OVARIAN HORMONES, ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES, INHIBITORS & ANTAGONISTS, & OVULATIONINDUCING AGENTS)

The ovary has important gametogenic functions that are integrated with its hormonal activity. In the human female, the gonad is relatively quiescent during childhood, the period of rapid growth and maturation. At puberty, the ovary begins a 30to 40-year period of cyclic function called the menstrual cycle because of the regular episodes of bleeding that are its most obvious manifestation. It then fails to respond to gonadotropins secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, and the cessation of cyclic bleeding that occurs is called menopause.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) updated its guidelines (62). The ACOG recommends that women not initiate cervical cancer screening until they are 21, regardless of the onset of sexual activity. This acknowledges the very low prevalence of invasive cancer in very young women, the long multiyear process of cervical carcinogenesis, and the very low but real risks for preterm birth associated with outpatient excisional procedures. Likewise screening frequency was revised to every 2 years from age 21 to 29 (with either conventional slide or liquid-based cytology), and every 3 years for women after age 30 years if three consecutive negative, i.e., negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM) Pap tests can be documented. More frequent screening continues to be recommended for HIV-positive women (twice first year and annually after), those who are immune-suppressed, diethylstilbestrol (DES) daughters, and for those with a history of CIN 2 or greater (screen annually for 20 years). Discontinuation of screening is reasonable between 65 to 70 years, with reassessment of risk factors annually to determine if reinitiating screening is appropriate. Likewise in the setting of posthysterectomy for benign indications it is reasonable to discontinue screening in the absence of a history of high-grade CIN or cancer (Table 19.3).

The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) assay is the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism: in clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient.

As health care providers for women, gynecologists are responsible for providing care that extends beyond diseases of the reproductive organs to include much of the general medical care of their patients. Broadening the spectrum of care requires adjustments in practice, with less emphasis placed on the surgical aspects of the specialty. Early diagnosis and treatment of medical illnesses can have a major impact on a woman’s health. Although timely referral is important for complex and advanced diseases, many conditions can be recognized and treated initially by gynecologists.

Respiratory problems are the most common reasons patients seek care from a physician, so gynecologists should be aware of their pathophysiology. Cardiovascular disease has a significant impact on overall morbidity and is the main cause of death in women. Cardiovascular disease is associated with cigarette smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus. These conditions are responsive to screening, behavior modification, and control to lower risk factors. Thyroid disease is a major cause of morbidity for women. Because of the interaction of hormones and the overall effect on the endocrine system, thyroid disease can be of special significance in women. The gynecologist should provide screening and initial therapy for these conditions and assess the need for referral.

Infections of the respiratory system can range from the common cold to life-threatening illness. Those with risk factors should be counseled about preventive measures. Vaccines against ﬂu and pneumonia should be offered as indicated.

Pneumonia can present as right or left upper quadrant abdominal pain.

All female patients with an acute abdomen require a pelvic exam and a pregnancy test to rule out PID, ectopic pregnancy, and ovarian torsion.

McBurney’s point is located one-third of the distance from the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus.

“Hamburger sign”: If a patient wants to eat, consider a diagnosis other than appendicitis. Anorexia is 80% specific for appendicitis.

Psoas sign: Passive extension of the hip leading to RLQ pain.

Obturator sign: Passive internal rotation of the ﬂ exed hip leading to RLQ pain.

Rovsing’s sign: Deep palpation of the LLQ leading to RLQ pain.

In perforated appendix, partial pain relief is possible, but peritoneal signs (e.g., rebound, guarding, hypotension, ↑ WBC count, fever) will ultimately develop.

Children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with retrocecal appendices may have atypical presentations that may result in misdiagnosis and ↑ mortality.

Diagnosed by clinical impression.

Look for fever, mild leukocytosis (11,000–15,000 cells/μL) with left shift, and UA with a few RBCs and/or WBCs.

If the clinical diagnosis is unequivocal, no imaging studies are necessary. Otherwise, studies include the following:

KUB: Fecalith or loss of psoas shadow.

Ultrasound: Enlarged, noncompressible appendix.

CT scan with contrast (95–98% sensitive): Periappendiceal stranding or ﬂuid; enlarged appendix.

The patient should be NPO and should receive IV hydration and antibiotics with anaerobic and gram-coverage.

Immediate open or laparoscopic appendectomy is the definitive treatment. If appendicitis is not found, complete exploration of the abdomen is performed.

Bowel sounds are hypoactive and are substantially decreased with peritonitis related to a ruptured diverticular abscess. Abdominal examination reveals distention with left lower quadrant tenderness on direct palpation and localized rebound tenderness. Abdominal and bimanual rectovaginal examinations may reveal a poorly mobile, doughy inﬂammatory mass in the left lower quadrant. Leukocytosis and fever are common. Stool guaiac may be positive as a result of inﬂammation of the colon or microperforation.

CT with and without contrast is an important adjunct to history and physical examination (30). It will reveal a swollen, edematous bowel and can rule out an abscess. A barium enema is contraindicated. Diverticulitis is initially managed medically with intravenous administration of ﬂuids, strict restriction of oral intake, and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. A diverticular abscess, obstruction, fistula, or perforation requires general surgical intervention.

Intestinal Obstruction The most common causes of intestinal obstruction in women are postsurgical adhesions, hernia formation, inﬂammatory bowel disease, or carcinoma of the bowel or ovary.

Intestinal obstruction is heralded by the onset of colicky abdominal pain followed by abdominal distention, vomiting, constipation, and obstipation. Higher and more acute obstruction results in early vomiting. Colonic obstruction presents with a greater degree of abdominal distention and obstipation. Vomiting first consists of gastric contents, followed by bile, then material with feculent odor, depending on the level of obstruction.

Fever is often present in the late stages. At the onset of mechanical obstruction, bowel sounds are high pitched and maximal during an episode of colicky pain. As the obstruction progresses, bowel sounds decrease and, when absent, suggest ischemic bowel. Marked abdominal distention often ensues.

document (2) 

The cardinal signs are colicky abdominal pain, abdominal distention, emesis, and obstipation. More intraluminal fluid accumulates in patients with distal obstruction, which typically leads to greater distention, more discomfort, and delayed emesis. This emesis is feculent when there is bacterial overgrowth. Patients with more proximal obstruction commonly present with less abdominal distention but more pronounced vomiting. Elements of the history that might be helpful include any prior history of surgery, including herniorrhaphy, as well as any history of cancer or inflammatory bowel disease.

Most patients, even with simple obstruction, appear to be critically ill. Many may be oliguric, hypotensive, and tachycardic because of severe intravascular volume depletion. Fever is worrisome for strangulation or systemic inflammatory changes. Bowel sounds and bowel functional activity are notoriously difficult to interpret. Classically, many patients with early small-bowel obstruction will have high-pitched, “musical” tinkling bowel sounds and peristaltic “rushes” known as borborygmi. Later in the course of disease, the bowel sounds may be absent or hypoactive as peristaltic activity decreases. This is in contrast to the common findings in patients with ileus or pseudo-obstruction where bowel sounds are typically absent or hypoactive from the beginning. Lastly, patients with partial blockage may continue to pass flatus and stool, and those with complete blockage may evacuate bowel contents present downstream beyond their obstruction.

All surgical incisions should be examined. The presence of a tender abdominal or groin mass strongly suggests that an incarcerated hernia may be the cause of obstruction. The presence of tenderness

grossly bloody stools; most patients presenting for medical attention have ≥10 bowel movements on the worst day of illness. Abdominal pain usually consists of cramping and may be the most prominent symptom. Pain is usually generalized but may become localized; C. jejuni infection may cause pseudoappendicitis. Fever may be the only initial manifestation of C. jejuni infection, a situation mimicking the early stages of typhoid fever. Febrile young children may develop convulsions. Campylobacter enteritis is generally self-limited; however, symptoms persist for >1 week in 10–20% of patients seeking medical attention, and clinical

The clinical features of infections due to Campylobacter and the related Arcobacter and intestinal Helicobacter species causing enteric disease appear to be highly similar. C. jejuni can be considered the prototype, in part because it is by far the most common enteric pathogen in the group. A prodrome of fever, headache, myalgia, and/or malaise often occurs 12–48 h before the onset of diarrheal symptoms. The most common signs and symptoms of the intestinal phase are diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. The degree of diarrhea varies from several loose stools to grossly bloody stools;

FIGURE 201-2 Clinical picture of metatarsus adductus with a nor-mal foot on opposite side. (From Kliegman RM, Behrman, RE, Jenson HB, et al: Nelson’s Textbook of Pediatrics, ed 18, Philadelphia, 2007, Saunders, p 2777.)

About 20% of patients will require an anterior tibialis tendon transfer in early childhood. Rarely, more aggressive surgical procedures may need to be done. Complications of untreated clubfoot include severe disability. Complications of treated clubfoot include recurrence and stiffness.

In-Toeing, Out-Toeing, and Toe-Walking

Metatarsus adductus is the most common foot disorder in infants. It is characterized by a convexity of the lateral foot (Fig. 201-2) and is caused by in utero positioning. It is bilateral in half of cases. Occurring equally in boys and girls, it is more common in first-born children because of the smaller primigravid uterus. Two percent of infants with metatarsus adductus have developmental dysplasia of the hip.

The forefoot is adducted and sometimes supinated, but the midfoot and hindfoot are normal. The lateral border of the foot is convex, while the medial border is concave. Ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion are normal. With the midfoot and hindfoot stabilized, the deformity can be pushed beyond a neutral position (into abduction). Older children may present with an in-toeing gait.

True metatarsus adductus resolves spontaneously over 90% of the time without treatment, so reassurance is all that is needed. Metatarsus adductus that does not improve within 2 years needs evaluation by a pediatric orthopedist. Persistent cases may benefit from serial casting or bracing, and potentially surgery. The deformity is not associated with a disability.

An urgent surgical procedure was performed.

Burr holes were placed around the region of the hematoma and it was evacuated. The small branch of the middle meningeal artery was ligated and the patient spent a few days in the intensive care unit. Fortunately the patient made an uneventful recovery.

A 35-year-old man was involved in a fight and sustained a punch to the right orbit. He came to the emergency department with double vision.

The double vision was only in one plane.

Examination of the orbits revealed that when the patient was asked to look upward the right eye was unable to move superiorly when adducted. There was some limitation in general eye movement. Assessment of the lateral rectus muscle (abducent nerve [VI]), superior oblique muscle (trochlear nerve [IV]), and the rest of the eye muscles (oculomotor nerve [III]) was otherwise unremarkable.

The patient underwent a CT scan.

A CT scan of the facial bones demonstrated a fracture through the floor of the orbit (Fig. 8.293).

A careful review of this CT scan demonstrated that the inferior oblique muscle had been pulled inferiorly with the fragment of bone in the fracture. This produced a tethering effect, so when the patient was asked to gaze in the upward direction, the left eye was able to do so but the right eye was unable to because of the tethered inferior oblique muscle.

The patient underwent surgical exploration to elevate the small bony fragment and return the inferior oblique to its appropriate position. On follow-up the patient had no complications.

A 25-year-old man complained of significant swelling in front of his right ear before and around mealtimes. This swelling was associated with considerable pain, which was provoked by the ingestion of lemon sweets. On examination he had tenderness around the right parotid region and a hard nodule was demonstrated in the buccal mucosa adjacent to the right upper molar teeth.

A diagnosis of parotid duct calculus was made.

In the later months of pregnancy, the fetus assumes a characteristic posture described as attitude or habitus (see Fig. 22-1). As a rule, the fetus forms an ovoid mass that corresponds roughly to the shape of the uterine cavity. The fetus becomes folded upon itself to create a convex back. The head is sharply lexed; the chin is almost in contact with the chest; the thighs are lexed over the abdomen; and the legs are bent at the knees. In all cephalic presentations, the arms usually lie across the thorax or parallel to the sides. The umbilical cord ills the space between the

extremities. his characteristic posture results from the mode of fetal growth and its accommodation to the uterine cavity.

Abnormal exceptions to this attitude occur as the fetal head becomes progressively more extended from the vertex to the face presentation. This results in a progressive change in fetal attitude from a convex (flexed) to a concave (extended) contour of the vertebral column.

Position refers to the relationship of an arbitrarily chosen portion of the fetal presenting part to the right or left side of the birth canal. Accordingly, with each presentation, there may be two positions-right or left. he fetal occiput, chin (mentum), and sacrum are the determining points in vertex, face, and breech presentations, respectively (hgs. 22 2 to

Because the presenting part may be in either the left or right position, there are left and right occipital (LO and RO), left and right mental (LM and RM), and left and right sacral (LS and RS) designations.

Further, the relationship of a given portion of the presenting part to the anterior (A), transverse (T), or posterior (P) portion of the maternal pelvis is considered. As shown in Figures 22-2 to 22-6, there are six varieties of each of the three presentations. Thus, in an occiput presentation, the presentation, position, and variety may be abbreviated in clockwise fashion as:

The biparietal diameter is measured perpendicular to the sagittal midline, from the outer edge of the skull in the near field to the inner edge of the skull in the far field. By convention, the near field is that which is closer to the sonographic transducer. The head circumference is measured circumferentially around the outer border of the skull. B. Femur length. The femur is measured perpendiCUlar to the femoral shaft, from each diaphyseal end, excluding the epiphysis. C. Abdominal circumference. This is a transverse measurement at the level of the stomach (5). The J-shaped structure (arrowheads) indicates the confluence of the umbilical vein and the right portal vein.

If the head shape is lattened-dolichocephay, or roundedbrachycephay, the HC is more reliable than the BPD. hese head shape variants may be normal or can be secondary to fetal position or oligohydramnios. But, dolichocephaly can occur with neural-tube defects, and brachycephaly may be seen in fetuses with Down syndrome. lso, with abnormal skull shape, craniosynostosis and other craniofacial abnormalities are a consideration.

structures are assessed in a similar fashion as in the left heart. Extension of the catheter into the pulmonary artery allows measurement of pulmonary artery pressures as well as pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (reflecting left ventricular end diastolic pres-sure) with an occlusive balloon. In addition to these measure-ments, cardiac output can be measured using thermodilution or by the Fick method using oxygen saturations of blood sampled from the various locations during the procedure.Brunicardi_Ch21_p0801-p0852.indd   80601/03/19   5:32 PM 807ACQUIRED HEART DISEASECHAPTER 21Figure 21-2. Cardiac catheterization angiography.

cardiogenic shock from blunt cardiac injury. Rela-tively few patients with blunt cardiac injury will develop cardiac pump dysfunction. Those who do generally exhibit cardiogenic shock early in their evaluation. Therefore, establishing the diag-nosis of blunt cardiac injury is secondary to excluding other etiologies for shock and establishing that cardiac dysfunction is present.

Subsequent recovery of intracardiac and intrapulmonary air may require open surgical or angiographic techniques. Treatment may prove futile if the air bolus is larger than 50 mL, however.Pulmonary Artery Rupture Flow-directed, pulmonary artery (Swan-Ganz) catheters can cause pulmonary artery rupture due to excessive advancement of the catheter into the pulmonary cir-culation. There usually is a sentinel bleed with coughing noted when a pulmonary artery catheter balloon is inflated, followed by uncontrolled hemoptysis. Reinflation of the catheter balloon is

document (3) 

The distal lumen of the catheter, which is beyond the balloon, measures left atrial pressure (LAP) and, in the absence of mitral valvular disease, LAP approximates LVEDP. Pulmonary–capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) equals the LAP, which equals LVEDP and is normal at 8 to 12 mm Hg. Because the standard pulmonary artery catheter has an incorporated thermistor, thermodilution studies can be performed to determine cardiac output. This thermodilution method is performed by injecting cold 5% dextrose in water through the proximal port of the catheter, which cools the blood entering the right atrium. The change in temperature measured at the more distal thermistor (4 cm from the catheter tip) generates a curve proportional to cardiac output. Knowledge of the cardiac output is helpful in establishing cardiovascular diagnoses. For example, a patient with hypotension, low-to-normal wedge pressure, and a cardiac output of 3 L per minute is most likely hypovolemic. The same patient with a cardiac output of 8 L per minute is probably septic with resultant low systemic vascular resistance.

Pulmonary artery catheters are associated with a small but significant complication rate. The complications can be grouped into those occurring during venous cannulation or insertion, during maintenance and use, and those related to interpretation of hemodynamic data (210). The most common problems encountered during venous access are cannulation of the carotid or subclavian artery and introduction of a pneumothorax. Problems resulting from the catheter itself include dysrhythmias, sepsis, and disruption of the pulmonary artery. Pulmonary artery catheters (PAC) should be placed under the supervision of experienced personnel in a setting in which complications can be rapidly diagnosed and treated. Accessory equipment such as resuscitation equipment and an external pacing device must be immediately available. Ultrasound and ﬂuoroscopic equipment if available may aid in PAC placement (211).

Most episodes of fever in children younger than 3 years of age have a demonstrable source of infection elicited by history, physical examination, or a simple laboratory test. In this age group, the most commonly identified serious bacterial infection is a UTI. A blood culture to evaluate for occult bacteremia, and urinalysis and urine culture to evaluate for a UTI, should be considered for all children younger than 3 years of age with fever without localizing signs. Stool culture should be obtained in those with diarrhea marked by blood or mucous. Ill-appearing children should be admitted to the hospital and treated with empirical antibiotics.

Approximately 0.2% of well-appearing febrile children 3 to 36 months of age vaccinated against S. pneumoniae and

H. influenzae and without localizing signs have occult bacteremia. Risk factors for occult bacteremia include temperature of 102.2° F (39° C) or greater, WBC count of 15,000/mm3 or more, and elevated absolute neutrophil count, band count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or C-reactive protein. No combination of demographic factors (socioeconomic status, race, gender, and age), clinical parameters, or laboratory tests in these children reliably predicts occult bacteremia. Occult bacteremia in otherwise healthy children is usually transient and self-limited but may progress to serious localizing infections. Well-appearing children usually are followed as

Regardless of antibiotic treatment, close follow-up for at least 72 hours, including re-evaluation in 24 hours or immediately with any clinical change, is essential. Children with a positive blood culture require immediate re-evaluation, repeat blood culture, consideration for lumbar puncture, and empirical antibiotic treatment.

Defned as a single oral temperature of ≥ 38.3°C (101°F) or a temperature of ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F) for ≥ 1 hour in a neutropenic patient (i.e., an absolute neutrophil count of < 500 cells/mm3).

Hx/PE: Common in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy (neutropenic nadir 7–10 days postchemotherapy). Infammation may be minimal or absent.

Dx:

Send appropriate cultures, including blood, urine, sputum, and wound. Consider testing for viruses, fungi, and mycobacteria.

Conduct a thorough physical exam, but avoid a rectal exam in light of the bleeding risk if the patient is thrombocytopenic.

Obtain a CBC with differential, serum creatinine, BUN, and transaminases; order blood, urine, lesion, and stool cultures.

CXR for patients with respiratory symptoms; CT scan to evaluate for abscesses or other occult infection.

Tx: Empiric antibiotic therapy (see Figure 2.8-13). Routine use of colony-stimulating factors is not indicated. If fevers persist after 72 hours despite antibiotic therapy, start antifungal treatment.

A tick-borne disease caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Usually seen during the summer months, and carried by Ixodes ticks on white-tailed deer and white-footed mice. Endemic to the Northeast, northern Midwest, and Pacif c coast.

Differentiation between viral and bacterial infections in young infants is difficult. Febrile infants <3 months of age who appear ill, especially if follow-up is uncertain, and all febrile infants <4 weeks of age should be admitted to the hospital for empirical antibiotics pending culture results. After blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures are obtained, broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics (typically ampicillin with cefotaxime or gentamicin) are administered. The choice of antibiotics depends on the pathogens suggested by localizing findings. The possibility of neonatal HSV should also be considered in febrile children <4 weeks old, and empirical acyclovir begun in those in whom neonatal HSV is a concern. Well-appearing febrile infants ≥4 weeks of age without an identifiable focus and with certainty of follow-up are at a low risk of developing a serious bacterial infection (0.8% develop bacteremia, and 2% develop a serious localized bacterial infection). Specific criteria identifying these low-risk infants include age older than 1 month, well-appearing without a focus of infection, no history of prematurity or prior antimicrobial therapy, a white blood cell (WBC) count of 5000 to 15,000/μL, and urine with less than 10 WBCs/high-power field. Fecal leukocyte testing and chest radiograph can be considered in infants with diarrhea or respiratory signs. Low-risk infants may be followed as outpatients without empirical antibiotic treatment, or, alternatively, may be treated with intramuscular ceftriaxone. Regardless of antibiotic treatment, close follow-up for at least 72 hours, including re-evaluation in 24 hours or immediately with any clinical change, is essential.

The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly.

The plasma Na+ concentration on admission was 113 meq/L, with a creatinine of 2.35 (Table 64e-1). At hospital hour 7, the plasma Na+ concentration was 120 meq/L, potassium 5.4 meq/L, chloride 90 64e-5 meq/L, bicarbonate 22 meq/L, BUN 32 mg/dL, creatinine 2.02 mg/dL, glucose 89 mg/dL, total protein 5.0, and albumin 1.9. The hematocrit was 33.9, white count 7.6, and platelets 405. A morning cortisol was 19.5, with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 1.7. The patient was treated with 1 μg of intravenous DDAVP, along with 75 mL/h of intravenous half-normal saline. After the plasma Na+ concentration dropped to 116 meq/L, intravenous fluid was switched to normal saline at the same infusion rate. The subsequent results are shown in Table 64e-1.

This patient presented with hypovolemic hyponatremia and a “prerenal” reduction in GFR, with an increase in serum creatinine. She had experienced diarrhea for some time and manifested an orthostatic tachycardia after a liter of normal saline. As expected for hypovolemic hyponatremia, the urine Na+ concentration was <20 meq/L in the absence of congestive heart failure or other causes of hypervolemic hyponatremia, and she responded to saline hydration with an increase in plasma Na+ concentration and a decrease in creatinine.

A 32-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with weakness and hypokalemia. The patient had been very healthy until 2 months previously when he developed intermittent leg weakness. His review of systems was otherwise negative. He denied drug or laxative abuse and was on no medications. Past medical history was unremarkable, with no history of neuromuscular disease. Family history was notable for a sister with thyroid disease. Physical examination was notable only for reduced deep tendon reflexes.

This patient developed hypokalemia due to a redistribution of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular compartments; this pathophysiology was readily apparent following calculation of the TTKG. The TTKG is calculated as (P × U )/(P ×

U ). The expected values for the TTKG are <3 in the presence of hypokalemia and >7–8 in the presence of hyperkalemia (see also Case 2 and Case 8). Alternatively, a urinary K+-to-creatinine ratio of >13 mmol/g creatinine (>1.5 mmol/mmol creatinine) is compatible with excessive renal K+ excretion. In this case, the calculated TTKG was 2.5, consistent with appropriate renal conservation of K+ and a nonrenal cause for hypokalemia. In the absence of significant gastrointestinal loss of K+, the patient was diagnosed with a “redistributive” subtype of hypokalemia.

Hemodialysis is the most effective and reliable method to reduce plasma K+ concentration; peritoneal dialysis is considerably less effective. Patients with acute kidney injury require temporary, urgent venous access for hemodialysis, with the attendant risks; in contrast, patients with ESRD or advanced chronic kidney disease may have a preexisting venous access. The amount of K+ removed during hemodialysis depends on the relative distribution of K+ between ICF and ECF (potentially affected by prior therapy for hyperkalemia), the type and surface area of the dialyzer used, dialysate and blood flow rates, dialysate flow rate, dialysis duration, and the plasma-to-dialysate K+ gradient.

Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalances and Acid-Base Disturbances: Case Examples David B. Mount, Thomas D. DuBose, Jr. CASE 1 64e

A 23-year-old woman was admitted with a 3-day history of fever, cough productive of blood-tinged sputum, confusion, and orthostasis. Past medical history included type 1 diabetes mellitus. A physical examination in the emergency department indicated postural hypo-tension, tachycardia, and Kussmaul respiration. The breath was noted to smell of “acetone.” Examination of the thorax suggested consolidation in the right lower lobe.

The diagnosis of the acid-base disorder should proceed in a stepwise fashion: 1.

The normal anion gap (AG) is 8–10 meq/L, but in this case, the AG is elevated (20 meq/L). Therefore, the change in AG (ΔAG) = ~10 meq/L.

Patients can present with fatigue, malaise, nausea, vomiting, anorexic fever, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The most com-mon physical findings are jaundice and hepatomegaly. Because the disease is self-limited, the treatment is usually supportive. Patients who develop fulminant infection require aggressive therapy and should be transferred to a center capable of per-forming liver transplantation.Hepatitis B and C, on the other hand, can both lead to chronic liver

document (3) 

Hepatomegaly is not a highly reliable sign of liver disease because of variability in the liver’s size and shape and the physical impediments to assessment of liver size by percussion and palpation. Marked hepatomegaly is typical of cirrhosis, veno-occlusive disease, infiltrative disorders such as amyloidosis, metastatic or primary cancers of the liver, and alcoholic hepatitis. Careful assessment of the liver edge may also reveal unusual firmness, irregularity of the surface, or frank nodules. Perhaps the most reliable physical finding in the liver examination is hepatic tenderness. Discomfort when the liver is touched or pressed upon should be carefully sought with percussive comparison of the right and left upper quadrants.

Splenomegaly, which occurs in many medical conditions, can be a subtle but significant physical finding in liver disease. The availability of ultrasound methods for assessment of the spleen allows confirmation of the physical finding.

Signs of advanced liver disease include muscle wasting and weight loss as well as hepatomegaly, bruising, ascites, and edema. Ascites is best appreciated by attempts to detect shifting dullness by careful percussion. Ultrasound examination will confirm the finding of ascites in equivocal cases. Peripheral edema can occur with or without ascites. In patients with advanced liver disease, other factors frequently contribute to edema formation, including hypoalbuminemia, venous insufficiency, heart failure, and medications.

Pregnancy and delivery predispose women to stress urinary incontinence, at least during their younger years. Of women who have not borne children, those who are pregnant leak more often than their nonpregnant counterparts; about half of women report symptoms of stress urinary incontinence during pregnancy, but in most, the symptom resolves after delivery. In a prospective study, 32% of 305 primiparas developed stress urinary incontinence during pregnancy and 7% after delivery. By 1 year, only 3% reported stress urinary incontinence (24). However, 5 years later, 19% of women with no symptoms after the first delivery had stress urinary incontinence. Of women reporting stress urinary incontinence 3 months postpartum (in most of whom it had resolved by 1 year), 92% had such leakage 5 years later. Transient postpartum leakage may be a marker for future incontinence.

Various changes happen after delivery that may predispose women to stress urinary incontinence. Levator ani muscle strength decreases (25). About 20% of women develop a visible defect in the levator ani muscles after vaginal delivery (26). The bladder neck descends, and the pelvic muscles undergo partial denervation with pudendal neuropathy (27). In most studies, parity is strongly associated with urinary incontinence in younger women (28). In studies of women 60 years and older, parity is no longer an independent risk factor for incontinence (29). The reason for this is not well elucidated, but it may be because the changes in muscle, nerve, connective tissue, and hormonal function that occur with aging make other women “catch up” to those who developed incontinence at a younger age because of delivery trauma. Alternately, it may be that medical problems more common in older women account for a larger proportion of incontinence risk as women age.

systems). Frailty is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence. Indeed, older women are more likely to have mixed (urge + stress) incontinence than any pure form (Fig. 11-18). In analogy with the other geriatric syndromes, urinary incontinence derives from a predisposing condition superimposed on a stressful precipitating factor. Accordingly, treatment of urinary incontinence should address both. The first line of treatment is bladder training associated with pelvic muscle exercise (Kegel exercises) that sometimes should be associated with electrical stimulation. Women with possible vaginal or uterine prolapse should be referred to

Alzheimer’s Disease Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia. Women are at greater risk for developing the disease than men, and the number of affected individuals in the United States is estimated to be more than 5 million with an annual cost of 183 billion dollars. Although several small studies suggest that hormone therapy may decrease the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, a randomized controlled study in women with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease showed that 1 year of estrogen therapy neither slowed disease progression nor improved cognition (61). The WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) was a randomized placebo-controlled study of women aged 65 years or older enrolled in WHI, which assessed the effect of hormone therapy on cognitive function. In contrast to observational studies, women in WHIMS randomized to hormone therapy experienced a significant twofold increased risk of dementia, most commonly Alzheimer’s disease (62). Hormone therapy use was associated with an adverse effect on cognition, as women randomized to hormone therapy scored significantly lower on the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination compared with placebo-treated women (63). Given the increased incidence of stroke identified in hormone therapy users in the WHI trial, it is possible that small, undetected cerebrovascular events were more likely to occur in the hormone therapy group, increasing the risk of dementia.

For a healthy woman with bothersome hot ﬂashes, hormone therapy remains a very reasonable option, especially if she is within 10 years of menopause or less than age 60. Hormone therapy should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals (64–66). The need for continued hormone therapy use should be assessed at least annually.

(See also Chaps. 94e and 415e) Among healthy aging people, total body weight peaks in the sixth decade of life and generally remains stable until the ninth decade, after which it gradually falls. In contrast, lean body mass (fat-free mass) begins to decline at a rate of 0.3 kg per year in the third decade, and the rate of decline increases further beginning at age 60 in men and age 65 in women. These changes in lean body mass largely reflect the age-dependent decline in growth hormone secretion and, consequently, circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor type I (IGF-I) that occur with normal aging. Loss of sex steroids, at menopause in women and more gradually with aging in men, also contributes to these changes in body composition. In the healthy elderly, an increase in fat tissue balances the loss in lean body mass until very old age, when loss of both fat and skeletal muscle occurs. Age-dependent changes also occur at the cellular level. Telomeres shorten, and body cell mass—the fat-free portion of cells— declines steadily with aging.

Between ages 20 and 80, mean energy intake is reduced by up to 1200 kcal/d in men and 800 kcal/d in women. Decreased hunger is a reflection of reduced physical activity and loss of lean body mass, producing lower demand for calories and food intake. Several important age-associated physiologic changes also predispose elderly persons to weight loss, such as declining chemosensory function (smell and taste), reduced efficiency of chewing, slowed gastric emptying, and alterations in the neuroendocrine axis, including changes in levels of leptin, cholecystokinin, neuropeptide Y, and other hormones and peptides. These changes are associated with early satiety and a decline in both appetite and the hedonistic appreciation of food. Collectively, they contribute to the “anorexia of aging.”

common colds per year, with the most affected being younger children and children attending day care. Infection is suggested by the presence of sore throat, fever, and poor appetite, especially with a history of exposure to others with colds. Chronic infectious rhinosinusitis, or sinusitis, should be suspected if there is mucopurulent nasal discharge with symptoms that persist beyond 10 days (see Chapter 104). Classic signs of acute sinusitis in older children include facial tenderness, tooth pain, headache, and fever. Classic signs are usually not present in young children who may present with postnasal drainage with cough,

nonspecific febrile illness (sUmmer grippe) The most common clinical manifestation of enterovirus infection is a nonspecific febrile illness. After an incubation period of 3–6 days, patients present with an acute onset of fever, malaise, and headache. Occasional cases are associated with upper respiratory symptoms, and some cases include nausea and vomiting. Symptoms often last for 3–4 days, and most cases resolve in a week. While infections with other respiratory viruses occur more often from late fall to early spring, febrile illness due to enteroviruses frequently occurs in the summer and early fall.

Serotype(s) of Indicated Virus generalized disease of tHe newborn Most serious enterovirus infections 1291 in infants develop during the first week of life, although severe disease can occur up to 3 months of age. Neonates often present with an illness resembling bacterial sepsis, with fever, irritability, and lethargy. Laboratory abnormalities include leukocytosis with a left shift, thrombocytopenia, elevated values in liver function tests, and CSF pleocytosis. The illness can be complicated by myocarditis and hypotension, fulminant hepatitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation, meningitis or meningoencephalitis, or pneumonia. It may be difficult to distinguish neonatal enterovirus infection from bacterial sepsis, although a history of a recent virus-like illness in the mother provides a clue.

gastroenteritis and include abdominal pain, vom-iting, and diarrhea. Alternatively, the child may present with symptoms of intestinal obstruction. An abdominal mass may be present in the lower abdomen. When the symptoms have been present for more than 4 or 5 days, and an abscess is suspected, it is reasonable to obtain a computerized tomogram of the abdo-men and pelvis with IV, oral, and rectal contrast in order to visu-alize the appendix and the presence of an associated abscess, phlegmon, or fecalith (Fig. 39-21).An individualized approach is necessary for the child who presents

Kernig’s sign (pain on knee extension when the hip is ﬂexed) and Brudzinski’s sign (pain with passive neck ﬂexion) are nonspecific signs of meningeal irritation.

Additional physical exam findings may include signs of ↑ ICP (papilledema, cranial nerve palsies) or petechial rash (N. meningitidis). Signs in neonates include lethargy, hyperor hypothermia, poor tone, a bulging fontanelle, and vomiting.

Head CT to rule out ↑ ICP (risk of brain stem herniation).

Perform an LP; send cell count with differential, glucose and protein levels, Gram stain, and culture.

Empiric antibiotic therapy regimens (ceftriaxone, vancomycin, ampicillin) should be administered until bacterial meningitis can be excluded.

Neonates should receive ampicillin and cefotaxime or gentamicin. Consider acyclovir if there is concern for herpes encephalitis (e.g., if the mother had HSV lesions at the time of the infant’s birth).

Older children should receive ceftriaxone and vancomycin.

A bacterial infection caused by Bordetella pertussis (whooping cough), a grambacillus. The DTaP vaccine (given in five doses in early childhood) is protective, but immunity wanes by adolescence. Adolescents and young adults serve as the primary reservoir for pertussis. Pertussis can be life threatening for young infants but is generally a milder infection in older children and adults.

Has three stages: (1) catarrhal (mild URI symptoms; lasts 1–2 weeks), (2) paroxysmal (paroxysms of cough with inspiratory whoop and post-tussive emesis; lasts 2–3 months), and (3) convalescent (symptoms wane).

Patients most often present in the paroxysmal stage but are most contagious in the catarrhal stage.

The classic presentation is an infant < 6 months of age with post-tussive emesis and apnea.

Rhinitis can be divided into allergic and nonallergic rhinitis (Table 79-1). Nonallergic rhinitis describes a group of nasal diseases in which there is no evidence of allergic etiology. It can be divided further into nonanatomic and anatomic etiologies. The most common form of nonallergic rhinitis in children is infectious rhinitis, which may be acute or chronic. Acute infectious rhinitis (the common cold) is caused by viruses, including rhinoviruses and coronaviruses, and typically resolves within 7 to 10 days (see Chapter 102). An average child has three to six common colds per year,

drainage with cough, throat clearing, halitosis, and rhinorrhea. The character of the nasal secretions with infectious rhinitis varies from purulent to minimal or absent. Coexistence of middle ear disease, such as otitis media or eustachian tube dysfunction, may be additional clues of infection.

Incorporation of novel and molecular targeting agents into these regimens is currently under investigation. For patients with FLT3ITD AML, trials with tyrosine kinase inhibitors are ongoing. Patients with CBF AML may benefit from the combination of gemtuzumab ozogamicin, a monoclonal CD33 antibody linked to the cytotoxic agent calicheamicin, with induction and consolidation chemotherapies. This agent, initially approved for older patients with relapsed disease, has been withdrawn from the U.S. market at the request of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration due to concerns about the product’s toxicity, including myelosuppression, infusion toxicity, and venoocclusive disease and the clinical benefit of the initially recommended higher doses. However, the aforementioned recent results are encouraging and support the reintroduction of this agent into the therapeutic armamentarium for AML.

In older patients (age ≥60 years), the outcome is generally poor likely due to a higher induction treatment–related mortality rate and frequency of resistant disease, especially in patients with prior hematologic disorders (MDS or myeloproliferative syndromes) or who have received chemotherapy treatment for another malignancy or harbor cytogenetic and genetic abnormalities that adversely impact on clinical outcome. These patients should be considered for clinical trials. Alternatively, older patients can be also treated with the 7 and 3 regimen with standard-dose cytarabine and idarubicin (12 mg/m2), daunorubicin (45–90 mg/m2), or mitoxantrone (12 mg/ m2). For patients older than 65 years, higher dose daunorubicin (90 mg/m2) has not shown benefit due to the increased toxicity and is not recommended. The combination of gemtuzumab ozogamicin with chemotherapy reduces the risk of relapse for patients age 50–70 years with previously untreated AML. Finally, older patients may be considered for single-agent therapies with clofarabine or hypomethylating agents (i.e., 5-azacitidine or decitabine). The latter are often used for patients unfit for more intensive therapies.

For younger patients, most studies include intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In the postremission setting, high-dose cytarabine for three to four cycles is more effective than standard-dose cytarabine. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB), for example, compared the duration of CR in patients randomly assigned after remission to four cycles of high (3 g/m2, every 12 h on days 1, 3, and 5), intermediate (400 mg/m2 for 5 days by continuous infusion), or standard (100 mg/m2 per day for 5 days by continuous infusion) doses of cytarabine. A dose-response effect for cytarabine in patients with AML who were age ≤60 years was demonstrated. High-dose cytarabine significantly prolonged CR and increased the fraction cured in patients with favorable [t(8;21) and inv(16)] and normal cytogenetics, but it had no significant effect on patients with other abnormal karyotypes. As discussed, high-dose cytarabine has increased toxicity in older patients. Therefore, in this age group, for patients without CBF AML, exploration of attenuated chemotherapy regimens has been pursued. However, because the outcome of older patients is poor, allogeneic HSCT, when feasible, should be strongly considered. Postremission therapy is also a setting for introduction of new agents (Table 132-5).

Autologous HSCT preceded by one to two cycles of high-dose cytarabine is also an option for intensive consolidation therapy. Autologous HSCT has been generally applied to AML patients in the context of a clinical trial or when the risk of repetitive intensive chemotherapy represents a higher risk than the autologous HSCT (e.g., in patients with severe platelet alloimmunization) or when other factors including patient age, comorbid conditions, and fertility are considered.

In the treatment of pain disorders, modest doses of TCAs are often sufficient. For example, 25–50 mg/d of imipramine might be beneficial in the treatment of pain associated with a neuropathy, but this would be a subtherapeutic dose in the treatment of MDD. In contrast, SNRIs are usually prescribed in pain disorders at the same doses used in the treatment of depression.

Although some potential adverse effects are common to all antidepressants, most of their adverse effects are specific to a subclass of agents and to their pharmacodynamic effects. An FDA warning applied to all antidepressants is the risk of increased suicidality in patients younger than 25. The warning suggests that use of antidepressants is associated with suicidal ideation and gestures, but not completed suicides, in up to 4% of patients under 25 who were prescribed antidepressant in clinical trials. This rate is about twice the rate seen with placebo treatment. For those over 25, there is either no increased risk or a reduced risk of suicidal thoughts and gestures on antidepressants, particularly after age 65. Although a small minority of patients may experience a treatment-emergent increase in suicidal ideation with antidepressants, the absence of treatment of a major depressive episode in all age groups is a particularly important risk factor in completed suicides.

A. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors

The adverse effects of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants—the SSRIs—can be predicted from their potent inhibition of SERT. SSRIs enhance serotonergic tone, not just in the brain but throughout the body. Increased serotonergic activity in the gut is commonly associated with nausea, gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal symptoms. Gastrointestinal adverse effects usually emerge early in the course of treatment and tend to improve after the first week. Increasing serotonergic tone at the level of the spinal cord and above is associated with diminished sexual function and interest. As a result, at least 30–40% of patients treated with SSRIs report loss of libido, delayed orgasm, or diminished arousal. The sexual effects often persist as long as the patient remains on the antidepressant but may diminish with time.

Other Disorders of Auditory Perception

On occasion, pontine lesions may be accompanied by complex auditory illusions, sometimes with the qualities of true hallucinations (pontine auditory hallucinosis) as in the patients, one of whom was ours, described by Cascino and Adams. These consist of alternating musical tones, like those of an organ; a jumble of sound, like a symphony orchestra tuning up; or siren-like or buzzing sounds, like a swarm of bees. These auditory sense disturbances are more complex than neurosensory tinnitus but less formed than temporal lobe hallucinations. They are usually associated with impairment of hearing in one or both ears and other neurologic signs related to the pontine lesion. An unpleasant degree of hyperacusis in the contralateral ear has also been reported with upper pontine tegmental lesions. BAEPs reveal intact cochlear, auditory nerve, and cochlear nuclear responses. As in the case of peduncular visual hallucinosis, patients realize that the sounds are unreal, that is, they have insight into their illusory nature.

Another well recognized but inexplicable type of auditory hallucinosis occurs in elderly patients with longstanding neurosensory deafness. All day long, or for several hours at a time, they hear songs, symphonies, choral music, or familiar or unfamiliar melodies interrupted only by other ambient noise, sleep, or conversations that engage their attention. The “choice” of music has been referable, not surprisingly, to the individual’s earlier life. Our patients, like those reported by Hammeke and colleagues, have been neither depressed nor demented, and antiepileptic and neuroleptic drugs have had no effect. Activation of the right auditory cortex on single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) and magnetoencephalography has been reported in such a case by Kasai and colleagues. The problem may be analogous to the one of Charles Bonnet syndrome, in which elderly individuals with failing vision experience rich visual hallucinations. We find it puzzling that pontine lesions are implicated in some cases, as mentioned previously.

The parkinsonian dementia syndromes are under increasing study, with many cases unified by Lewy body and Lewy neurite pathology that ascends from the low brainstem up through the substantia nigra, 2606 limbic system, and cortex. The DLB clinical syndrome is characterized by visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, fluctuating alertness, falls, and often rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Dementia can precede or follow the appearance of parkinsonism. Hence, one pathway occurs in patients with long-standing PD without cognitive impairment, who slowly develop a dementia that is associated with visual hallucinations and fluctuating alertness.

As a rule, narcolepsy has a gradual onset between the ages of 15 and 35 years; in fully 90 percent of narcoleptics, the condition is established by age 25. Narcolepsy is usually the first symptom, less often cataplexy, and rarely sleep paralysis. The essential disorder is one of frequent attacks of irresistible sleepiness. Several times a day, usually after meals or while sitting in class or in other boring or sedentary situations, the affected person is assailed by an uncontrollable desire to sleep.

excitement, or certain sustained motor activities. An evoked train of myoclonic jerks may progress to a generalized seizure with loss of consciousness. As the disease advances, the myoclonus interferes increasingly with the patient’s motor activities until voluntary function is seriously impaired. Speech may be marred, much as it is in chorea. Close examination may also reveal an alteration in muscle tone and a slight degree of cerebellar ataxia. At this time, or even before the onset of myoclonus and seizures, the patient may experience visual hallucinations or exhibit irritability, odd traits of character, uninhibited or

Beginning in late childhood and adolescence (11 to 18 years) in a previously normal individual, the disease announces itself by a seizure, a burst of myoclonic jerks, or both. In about half the cases there are focal (often occipital) seizures. The illness may at first be mistaken for ordinary epilepsy, but within a few months it becomes evident that something far more serious is occurring. The myoclonus becomes widespread and can be evoked as a startle by noise, an unexpected tactile stimulus (even the tap of a reflex hammer), and also by excitement, or certain sustained

The periods of sleep rarely last longer than 15 min unless the patient is reclining, when he may continue to sleep for an hour or longer. At the conclusion of a nap, the patient feels somewhat refreshed. It should be emphasized that there are many narcoleptics who tend to be pervasively drowsy throughout the day.

Rigidity or hypotonia, impaired tendon reflexes, acrocyanosis, and rarely corticospinal tract signs are late findings. Finally, the patient becomes cachectic and bedfast and succumbs to intercurrent infection. Most do not survive beyond their twenty-fifth birthday. Nonetheless there are isolated reports of Lafora-body disease in which symptoms began as late as age 40 years, with death as late as age 50 years.

JP is a 33-year-old woman who presents with complaints of fatigue requiring daytime naps, weight gain, cold intoler-ance, and muscle weakness for the last few months. These complaints are new since she used to always feel “hot,” noted difficulty sleeping, and could eat anything that she wanted without gaining weight. She also would like to become preg-nant in the near future. Because of poor medication adherence to methimazole and propranolol, she received radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, developed hypothyroidism, and was started on levothyroxine 100 mcg daily. Other medications include calcium carbonate three times daily to “protect her bones” and omeprazole for “heartburn.” On physical exami-nation, her blood pressure is 130/89 mm Hg with a pulse of 50 bpm. Her weight is 136 lb (61.8 kg), an increase of 10 lb (4.5 kg) in the last year. Her thyroid gland is not palpable and her reflexes are delayed. Laboratory findings include a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 24.9 μIU/mL (normal 0.45–4.12 μIU/mL) and a free thyroxine level of 8 pmol/L (normal 10–18 pmol/L). Evaluate the management of her past history of hyperthyroidism and assess her current thyroid status. Identify your treatment recommendations to maximize control of her current thyroid status.

The normal thyroid gland secretes sufficient amounts of the thyroid hormones—triiodothyronine (T3) and tetraiodothyronine (T4, thyroxine)—to normalize growth and development, body temperature, and energy levels. These hormones contain 59% and 65% (respectively) of iodine as an essential part of the molecule. Calcitonin, the second type of thyroid hormone, is important in the regulation of calcium metabolism and is discussed in Chapter 42.

The recommended daily adult iodide (I−)† intake is 150 mcg (200 mcg during pregnancy and lactation and up to 250 mcg for children).

Other important hormonal changes also occur in conjunction with puberty. Growth hormone (GH) levels increase early in puberty, stimulated in part by the pubertal increases in estrogen secretion. GH increases insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), which enhances linear growth. The growth spurt is generally less pronounced in girls than in boys, with a peak growth velocity of ~7 cm/year. Linear growth is ultimately limited by closure of epiphyses in the long bones as a result of prolonged exposure to estrogen. Puberty is also associated with mild insulin resistance.

The differential diagnosis of precocious and delayed puberty is similar in boys (Chap. 411) and girls. However, there are differences in the timing of normal puberty and differences in the relative frequency of specific disorders in girls compared with boys.

Precocious Puberty Traditionally, precocious puberty has been defined as the development of secondary sexual characteristics before the age of 8 in girls based on data from Marshall and Tanner in British girls studied in the 1960s. More recent studies led to recommendations that girls be evaluated for precocious puberty if breast development or pubic hair is present at <7 years of age for white girls or <6 years for black girls.

2023-11-29 14:09:09,805 query: A one-day-old male is evaluated in the hospital nursery for bilious vomiting. The patient has urinated multiple times since birth but has not yet passed meconium. He was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 36-year-old gravida 3 via vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The patient’s mother received routine prenatal care and declined first trimester screening. She subsequently underwent a quadruple screen at 15 weeks gestation that demonstrated decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A. Her last ultrasound prior to onset of labor demonstrated an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm. The patient’s two older siblings are both healthy. The patient’s temperature is 97.8°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 58/37 mmHg, pulse is 166/min, and respirations are 38/min. On physical exam, the patient is in moderate distress. His abdomen is firm and distended with hypoactive bowel sounds.

Chronic ectopic pregnancy is a condition in which the pregnancy does not completely resorb during expectant management. The condition arises when there is persistence of the chorionic villi with bleeding into the tubal wall, which is distended slowly and does not rupture. It may arise from chronic bleeding from the fimbriated end of the fallopian tube with subsequent tamponade. In a series of 50 patients with a chronic ectopic pregnancy, pain was present in 86%, vaginal bleeding was present in 68%, and both symptoms were present in 58% (234). Ninety percent of the patients had amenorrhea ranging from 5 to 16 weeks (mean, 9.6 weeks). Most patients develop a pelvic mass that usually is symptomatic. The β-hCG level usually is low but may be absent; ultrasonography may be helpful in the diagnosis; rarely, bowel involvement or ureteral compression or obstruction exists (234,235).

This condition is treated surgically with removal of the affected tube. Often, the ovary must be removed because there is inﬂammation with subsequent adhesion development. A hematoma may be present secondary to chronic bleeding.

Cervical Pregnancy The incidence of cervical pregnancy in the United States ranges from

Pregnancy 1 in 2,400 to 1 in 50,000 pregnancies and accounts for less than 1% of ectopic pregnancies (236,237). The cause of cervical ectopic pregnancies is unknown and the rare occurrence prevents identification of known risk factors. The incidence does appear to be higher with in vitro fertilization procedures, accounting for 3.7% of IVF-related ectopic pregnancies (238).

The clinical criteria for diagnosing a cervical pregnancy include the following findings (239): 1.

Uterus is smaller than the surrounding distended cervix; 2.

3.

4.

Profuse bleeding on manipulation of cervix.

Patients classically present with painless vaginal bleeding, but reports of associated cramping and pain are published (240).

During scanning, because of theoretical temperature elevation in tissues exposed to pulsed Doppler beam, this modality is applied only when needed for additional diagnostic purposes. M-mode should be used to document cardiac activity and measure the rate (Lane, 2013). Finding of an IUP and cardiac activity lowers subsequent miscarriage rates (Siddiqi, 1988).

In addition to the diagnostic parameters of Table 18-3, other softer sonographic markers may portend early pregnancy failure. Values for yolk sac diameters (measured inner-to-inner ring) for each gestational week in normal pregnancy have been established. Yolk sac diameters ::6 mm in pregnancies < 10 weeks' gestation are suspicious for pregnancy failure (Berdahl, 2010; Lindsay, 1992). The fetal heart rate in the irst trimester rises from 110 to 130 beats per minute (bpm) at 6 weeks' gestation to 160 to 170 bpm at 8 weeks (Achiron, 1991; Rauch, 2009). A slower heart rate is unfavorable, especially those <85 bpm (Laboda, 1989; Stefos, 1998). Even with cardiac activity, fetuses with a small MSD may presage embryonic loss. Speciically, a diference <5 mm between the MSD and CRL values raises concern (Bromley, 1991; Dickey, 1992). Last, subchorionic hematoma, that is, blood collected between the chorion and uterine wall, often accompanies threatened miscarriage. Studies are contradictory as to its association with ultimate pregnancy loss (Pedersen, 1990; Stabile, 1989; Tuuli, 2011). Bennett and associates (1996) noted that miscarriage risk correlated with larger hematoma size, older maternal age, and bleeding at a gestational age :;8 weeks.

With rapid confirmation of embryonic or fetal death, surgicalior medical evacuation or expectant observation is an option. As with induced abortion, nonsurgical options balance their noninvasiveness against heavier procedural bleeding, longer completion times, and lower success rates. Of options, expectant care underperforms medical or surgical options, and failure rates range from 15 to 50 percent (Luise, 2002; Trinder, 2006; Zhang, 2005). Also, weeks may pass between pregnancy failure diagnosis and actual spontaneous miscarriage.

The standard for diagnosing pregnancy.

Produced by the placenta; peaks at 100,000 mIU/mL by 10 weeks of gesta tion. ■↓ throughout the second trimester; levels off in the third trimester.

hCG levels double approximately every 48 hours during early pregnancy. This is often used to diagnose ectopic pregnancy when doubling is abnormal.

Maternal serum α-fetoprotein (MSAFP), which is produced by the fetus, crosses the placenta in small amounts and enters the maternal circulation. Measurement results are reported as multiples of the median (MoMs) and depend on accurate gestational dating.

Elevated MSAFP (> 2.5 MoMs): Associated with open neural tube defects (anencephaly, spina bifda), abdominal wall defects (gastroschisis, omphalocele), multiple gestation, incorrect gestational dating, fetal death, and placental abnormalities (e.g., placental abruption).

Decreased MSAFP (< 0.5 MoM): Associated with trisomy 21 and 18, fetal demise, and inaccurate gestational dating.

MSAFP is now rarely performed alone because its sensitivity for detecting chromosomal abnormalities is ↑ by adding inhibin A to estriol, β-hCG, and MSAFP (quad screening). Results of quad screening are as follows: gradually increases an addi   tional 10% by 28 weeks.

gestational age. Oligohydramnios indicates an amnionic fluid volume below normal range, and subjective crowding of the fetus is often noted. Hydramnios-also calledpoyhydramniosdefines a volume above a given normal threshold. Amnionic luid volume is usually assessed semiquantitatively. Measurements include either the single deepest vertical luid pocket or the sum of the deepest vertical pockets from each of four equal uterine quadrants-the amnionic luid index (Phelan, 1987). Reference ranges have been established for both measurements from 16 weeks' gestation onward. he single deepest vertical pocket is normally between 2 and 8 cm, and the amnionic luid index normally ranges between 8 and 24 cm. A further discussion and images are provided in Chapter 11 (p. 227).

Evaluation of the relationship between the placenta and the internal cervical os is an essential component of the standard sonogram. Abnormalities of the placenta and umbilical cord are reviewed in Chapter 6 (p. 111). Although the cervix may be imaged transabdominally (Fig. 10-4), this is often limited

Cerebral blood flow has been extensively investigated in the elderly population. Most studies show that flow declines with age and that the cerebral metabolic rate declines in parallel. There is also an age-related increase in cerebrovascular resistance. Declines in flow are somewhat greater in the cortex than in white matter and greater in prefrontal regions than in other parts of the hemispheres. Obrist demonstrated a 28 percent reduction in cerebral flow by age 80. It is noteworthy, however, that every cohort of elderly persons tested in this way contained a significant proportion in which cerebral blood flow was equivalent to that in young control subjects. In fact, in a group of 72-year-old men rigorously selected on the basis of freedom from disease, Sokoloff demonstrated that cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption did not differ from those of normal men 22 years of age. Nevertheless, cerebral glucose metabolism was reduced in all the elderly subjects.

With advancing age there is a general tendency for the electroencephalogram (EEG) to show a slowing of the alpha rhythm, an increase in beta activity, a decline in the percentage of slow-wave sleep, and an increasing intrusion of theta rhythms, particularly over the temporal lobes, although there are large individual differences.

To avoid exercise-related hyperor hypoglycemia, individuals with type 1 DM should (1) monitor blood glucose before, during, and after exercise; (2) delay exercise if blood glucose is >14 mmol/L (250 mg/ dL) and ketones are present; (3) if the blood glucose is <5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL), ingest carbohydrate before exercising; (4) monitor glu cose during exercise and ingest carbohydrate to prevent hypoglycemia; (5) decrease insulin doses (based on previous experience) before exercise and inject insulin into a nonexercising area; and (6) learn individual glucose responses to different types of exercise and increase food intake for up to 24 h after exercise, depending on intensity and duration of exercise. In individuals with type 2 DM, exercise-related hypoglycemia is less common but can occur in individuals taking either insulin or insulin secretagogues.

younger age in both type 1 and type 2 DM, routine screening for coronary artery disease has not been shown to be effective and is not recommended (Chap. 419). Untreated proliferative retinopathy is a relative contraindication to vigorous exercise, because this may lead to vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment.

Optimal monitoring of glycemic control involves plasma glucose measurements by the patient and an assessment of long-term control by the physician (measurement of hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] and review of the patient’s self-measurements of plasma glucose). These measurements are complementary: the patient’s measurements provide a picture of short-term glycemic control, whereas the HbA1c reflects average glycemic control over the previous 2–3 months.

the main cause of declining androgen levels. The term andropause has been used to denote age-related decline in testosterone concentrations; this term is a misnomer because there is no discrete time when testosterone concentrations decline abruptly. The approach to evaluating hypogonadism is summarized in Fig. 411-6.

In epidemiologic surveys, low total and bioavailable testosterone concentrations have been associated with decreased appendicular skeletal muscle mass and strength, decreased self-reported physical function, higher visceral fat mass, insulin resistance, and increased risk of coronary artery disease and mortality, although the associations are weak. An analysis of signs and symptoms in older men in the European Male Aging Study revealed a syndromic association of sexual symptoms with total testosterone levels below 320 ng/dL and free testosterone levels below 64 pg/mL in community-dwelling older men. In systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials, testosterone therapy of healthy older men with low or low-normal testosterone levels was associated with greater increments in lean body mass, grip strength, and self-reported physical function compared with placebo. Testosterone therapy also induced greater improvement in vertebral but not femoral bone mineral density. Testosterone therapy of older men with sexual dysfunction and unequivocally low testosterone levels improves libido, but testosterone effects on erectile function and response to selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors have been inconsistent. Testosterone therapy has not been shown to improve depression scores, fracture risk, cognitive function, response to phosphodiesterase inhibitors, or clinical outcomes in older men. Furthermore, neither the long-term risks nor clinical benefits of testosterone therapy in older men have been demonstrated in adequately powered trials. Although there is no evidence that testosterone causes prostate cancer, there is concern that testosterone therapy might cause subclinical prostate cancers to grow. Testosterone therapy is associated with increased risk of detection of prostate events (Fig. 411-7).

If conception occurs, hCG produced by the trophoblast binds to LH receptors on the corpus luteum, maintaining steroid hormone production and preventing involution of the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum is essential for the hormonal maintenance of the endometrium during the first 6–10 weeks of pregnancy until this function is taken over by the placenta.

Menstrual bleeding should become regular within 2–4 years of menarche, although anovulatory and irregular cycles are common before that. For the remainder of adult reproductive life, the cycle shortening of cycle length with age such that women over the age of 2379 35 have cycles that are shorter than during their younger reproductive years. Anovulatory cycles increase as women approach menopause, and bleeding patterns may be erratic.

Women who report regular monthly bleeding with cycles that do not vary by >4 days generally have ovulatory cycles, but several other clinical signs can be used to assess the likelihood of ovulation. Some women experience mittelschmerz, described as midcycle pelvic discomfort that is thought to be caused by the rapid expansion of the dominant follicle at the time of ovulation. A constellation of premenstrual moliminal symptoms such as bloating, breast tenderness, and food cravings often occur several days before menses in ovulatory cycles, but their absence cannot be used as evidence of anovulation. Methods that can be used to determine whether ovulation is likely include a serum progesterone level >5 ng/mL ~7 days before expected menses, an increase in basal body temperature of 0.24°C (>0.5°F) in the second half of the cycle due to the thermoregulatory effect of progesterone, or the detection of the urinary LH surge using ovulation predictor kits. Because ovulation occurs ~36 h after the LH surge, urinary LH can be helpful in timing intercourse to coincide with ovulation.

Evaluation of Acute Pelvic Pain

In the evaluation of acute pelvic pain, early diagnosis is critical because significant delay increases morbidity and mortality. Central to correct diagnosis is an accurate history. The date and character of the last and previous menstrual periods and the presence of abnormal bleeding or discharge should be ascertained. The menstrual, sexual, and contraceptive history and any history of sexually transmitted conditions and previous gynecologic disorders are relevant. Pain history should include how and when the pain started, pregnancy-related symptoms (amenorrhea, irregular bleeding, nausea, breast tenderness), GI symptoms (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, obstipation, absence of ﬂatus, hematochezia), urinary symptoms (dysuria, urgency frequency, hesitancy, hematuria), signs of infection (fever, chills, purulent vaginal discharge), and symptoms attributable to a hemoperitoneum (orthostasis, abdominal distention, and right upper quadrant or shoulder pain). Document any past medical and surgical history, and current medications.

Baseline laboratory studies will include, at the least, a complete blood count with differential (CBC), clean catch mid-stream routine urine analysis (RUA), sensitive urine or serum pregnancy test, gonorrhea and chlamydia screening, and a transvaginal pelvic ultrasound. Other tests such as computerized tomography (CT) with and without contrast, chemistry panel, or blood type and screen (if transfusion is likely) may be indicated depending on the patient’s symptoms and the specific differential diagnosis.

Abnormal bleeding, either intermenstrual or postcoital, can be caused by cervical lesions. Bleeding can result from endocervical polyps and infectious cervical lesions, such as condylomata, herpes simplex virus ulcerations, chlamydial cervicitis, or cervicitis caused by other organisms. Other benign cervical lesions, such as wide eversion of endocervical columnar epithelium or nabothian cysts, may be detected on examination but rarely cause bleeding.

Diagnosis of Abnormal Bleeding in Reproductive-Age Women

Coagulopathies and Other Hematologic Causes of Abnormal in Reproductive-Age Women As with adolescents, hematologic causes of abnormal bleeding should be considered in women with heavy menstrual bleeding, particularly in those who had abnormal bleeding since menarche. Of all women with menorrhagia, 5% to 20% have a previously undiagnosed bleeding disorder, primarily von Willebrand’s disease (171). Table 14.8 presents guidelines for a gynecologist’s suspicion of a bleeding disorder and pursuit of a diagnosis (81). Abnormal liver function, which can be seen with alcoholism or other chronic liver diseases, results in inadequate production of clotting factors and can lead to excessive menstrual bleeding.

Infections Causes As in adolescents, menorrhagia can be the first sign of endometritis in women infected with sexually transmissible organisms. Women with cervicitis, particularly chlamydial cervicitis, can experience irregular bleeding and postcoital spotting (see Chapter 18). Therefore, cervical testing for C. trachomatis should be considered, especially for adolescents, women in their 20s, and women who are not in a monogamous relationship. Endometritis can cause excessive menstrual ﬂow. Thus, a woman who seeks treatment for menorrhagia and increased menstrual pain and has a history of light-to-moderate previous menstrual ﬂow may have an upper genital tract infection or PID (endometritis, salpingitis, oophoritis). Occasionally, chronic endometritis will be diagnosed when an endometrial biopsy is obtained for evaluation of abnormal bleeding in a patient without specific risk factors for PID.

Severe intoxication occurs with the ingestion of 10 to 20 times the oral hypnotic dose. The patient cannot be roused by any means, that is, the patient is comatose. Respiration is slow and shallow or irregular, and pulmonary edema and cyanosis may be present. The tendon reflexes are usually, but not invariably, absent. Most patients show no response to plantar stimulation, but in those who do, the responses are extensor. With deep coma, the corneal and gag reflexes may also be abolished. Ordinarily the pupillary light reflex is retained in severe intoxication and is lost only if the patient is asphyxiated; but in advanced cases, the pupils become miotic and poorly reactive, simulating opiate intoxication. At this point respiration is greatly depressed and oculocephalic and oculovestibular reflex responses are usually abolished. In the early hours of coma, there may be a phase of flexor or extensor posturing or rigidity of the limbs, hyperactive reflexes, ankle clonus, and extensor plantar signs; persistence of these signs indicates that anoxic damage has been added. The temperature may be subnormal, the pulse is faint and rapid, and the blood pressure is greatly reduced. Failure of respiration to quicken on painful stimulation is an ominous sign.

There are few conditions other than barbiturate intoxication that cause a flaccid coma with small reactive pupils, hypothermia, and hypotension. A pontine hemorrhage may do so, but a hysterical trance or catatonic stupor does not present a problem in differential diagnosis. Serum toxicology studies provide a reliable means of identifying the type and amount of barbiturate in the blood. A patient who has also ingested alcohol may be comatose with relatively low blood barbiturate concentrations. Contrariwise, the barbiturate addict may show only mild signs of intoxication with very high blood barbiturate concentrations.

Management In mild or moderate intoxication, recovery is the rule and special treatment is not required except to prevent aspiration. If the patient is unresponsive, special measures must be taken to maintain respiration and prevent infection. An endotracheal tube should be inserted, with suctioning as necessary. Any risk of respiratory depression or underventilation requires the use of a mechanical ventilator.

Hemodialysis or hemofiltration with charcoal may be used in comatose patients who have ingested long-acting barbiturates and these treatments are particularly advisable if anuria or uremia has developed. Occasionally, in the case of a barbiturate addict who has taken an overdose of the drug, recovery from coma is followed by the development of abstinence symptoms, as described later.

Barbiturate Abstinence, or Withdrawal, Syndrome

Immediately following withdrawal, the patient seemingly improves over a period of 8 to 12 h, as the symptoms of intoxication diminish. Then a new group of symptoms develops, consisting of nervousness, tremor, insomnia, postural hypotension, and weakness. With chronic phenobarbital or barbital intoxication, withdrawal symptoms may not become apparent until 48 to 72 h after the final dose or it does not occur at all because of the slow metabolism and long half-life of these drugs. Generalized seizures with loss of consciousness may occur, usually between the second and fourth days of abstinence, but occasionally as long as 6 or 7 days after withdrawal. There may be a single seizure, several seizures, or, rarely, status epilepticus. Characteristically, in the withdrawal period, there is a greatly heightened sensitivity to photic stimulation, to which the patient responds with myoclonus or a seizure accompanied by paroxysmal changes in the EEG. The convulsive phase may be followed directly by a delusional-hallucinatory state or, as occurred in one of our cases (Romero et al), a full-blown delirium indistinguishable from delirium tremens. Death has been reported under these circumstances. The abstinence syndrome may occur in varying degrees of completeness; some patients have seizures and recover without developing delirium, and others have a delirium without preceding seizures.

Reeling Gait of Intoxication

This is characteristic of inebriation with alcohol, sedative drugs, and antiepileptic drugs. The drunken patient totters, reels, tips forward and then backward, appearing each moment to be on the verge of losing his balance and falling. Control over the trunk and legs are greatly impaired. The steps are irregular and uncertain. Such patients may appear indifferent to the quality of their performance, but under certain circumstances they can momentarily correct the defect. As indicated above, the adjectives drunken and reeling are used frequently to describe the gait of cerebellar disease, but the similarities between them are only superficial. The severely intoxicated patient reels or sways in many different directions and seemingly makes little or no effort to correct the staggering by watching his legs or the ground, as occurs in cerebellar or sensory ataxia. Also, the variability of the drunken gait is noteworthy. Despite wide excursions of the body and deviation from the line of march, the drunken patient may, for short distances, be able to walk on a narrow base and maintain his balance. In contrast, the patient with cerebellar gait has great difficulty in correcting his balance if he sways or lurches too far to one side. Milder degrees of the drunken gait resemble the gait disorder that follows loss of labyrinthine function discussed below.

BEHAVIORAL EFFECTS, TOLERANCE, AND WITHDRAWAL

The acute effects of a drug depend on the dose, the rate of increase in plasma, the concomitant presence of other drugs, and past experience with the agent. “Legal intoxication” with alcohol in most states requires a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 g/dL, but levels of 0.04 are cited in some other countries. However, behavioral, psychomotor, and cognitive changes are seen at 0.02–0.04 g/dL (i.e., after one to two drinks) (Table 467-1). Deep but disturbed sleep can be seen at twice the legal intoxication level, and death can occur with levels between 0.30 and 0.40 g/dL. Beverage alcohol is probably responsible for more overdose deaths than any other drug.

Repeated use of alcohol contributes to acquired tolerance, a phenomenon involving at least three compensatory mechanisms. (1) After 1–2 weeks of daily drinking, metabolic or pharmacokinetic tolerance can be seen, with up to 30% increases in the rate of hepatic ethanol metabolism. This alteration disappears almost as rapidly as it develops.

(2) Cellular or pharmacodynamic tolerance develops through neurochemical changes that maintain relatively normal physiologic functioning despite the presence of alcohol. Subsequent decreases in blood levels contribute to symptoms of withdrawal. (3) Individuals learn to adapt their behavior so that they can function better than expected under influence of the drug (learned or behavioral tolerance).

Blood Level, g/dL Usual Effect 0.02 Decreased inhibitions, a slight feeling of intoxication 0.08 0.20 Obvious slurred speech, motor incoordination, irritability, and poor judgment 0.30 Light coma and depressed vital signs 0.40 Death

The cellular changes caused by chronic ethanol exposure may not resolve for several weeks or longer following cessation of drinking. Rapid decreases in blood alcohol levels before that time can produce a withdrawal syndrome, which is most intense during the first 5 days, but some symptoms (e.g., disturbed sleep and anxiety) can take up to 4–6 months to resolve.

Cardiac disorders constitute the most common causes of sudden natural death. After an initial peak incidence of sudden death between birth and 6 months of age (sudden infant death syndrome [SIDS]), the incidence of sudden death declines sharply and remains low through childhood and adolescence. Among adolescents and young adults, the incidence of SCD is approximately 1 per 100,000 population per year. The incidence begins to increase in adults over age 30 years, reaching a second peak in the age range of 45–75 years, when it approximates 1–2 per 1000 per year among the unselected adult population.

The pulse generally is rapid and weak, and patients are often diaphoretic (sweating) and nauseous (particularly with posterior wall MIs). Dyspnea is common, resulting from impaired myocardial contractility and dysfunction of the mitral valve apparatus, with resultant acute pulmonary congestion and edema. With massive MIs (involving more than 40% of the left ventricle), cardiogenic shock develops.

Electrocardiographic abnormalities are important for the diagnosis of MI; these include Q waves, ST segment changes, and T wave inversions (the latter two representing abnormalities in myocardial repolarization). Arrhythmias caused by electrical abnormalities in the ischemic myocardium and conduction system are common; indeed, sudden cardiac death from a lethal arrhythmia accounts for the vast majority of MI-related deaths occurring before hospitalization.

The laboratory evaluation of MI is based on measuring blood levels of macromolecules that leak out of injured myocardial cells through damaged cell membranes (

Fig. 11.13 ). These molecules include myoglobin, cardiac troponins T and I (TnT, TnI), creatine kinase (CK;

Only ASA and β-blockers have been shown to have a mortality benef t in the treatment of angina.

A spectrum of clinical syndromes caused by plaque disruption or vasospasm that leads to acute myocardial ischemia.

Unstable angina describes chest pain that is new onset, is accelerating (i.e., occurs with less exertion, lasts longer, or is less responsive to medications), or occurs at rest; it is distinguished from stable angina by patient history. It signals the presence of possible impending infarction based upon plaque instability. In contrast, NSTEMI indicates myocardial necrosis marked by elevations in troponin I, troponin T, or CK-MB.

Patients should be risk stratified according to the TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction study) criteria to determine the likelihood of adverse cardiac events (see Table 2.1-10).

Unstable angina is not associated with elevated cardiac markers, but ST changes may be seen on ECG and are indicative of high-risk occlusions.

NSTEMI is diagnosed by serial cardiac enzymes and ECG.

Acute treatment of symptoms is the same as that for stable angina. Clopidogrel, unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (e.g., eptifibatide, tirofiban, abciximab) should also be considered.

Patients with chest pain refractory to medical therapy, a TIMI score of ≥ 3, a troponin elevation, or ST changes > 1 mm should be given heparin and scheduled for angiography and possible revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] or CABG).

Think unstable angina if chest pain is new onset, accelerating, or occurring at rest.

In the sitting position, flexion of the spine can be performed more easily, even to the point of bringing the knees in contact with the chest. The reason for this is that knee flexion relaxes tightened hamstring muscles and relieves the stretch on the sciatic nerve.

Examination with the patient in the reclining position yields much the same information as in the standing and sitting positions. With lumbosacral disc lesions and sciatica, passive lumbar flexion causes little pain and is not limited as long as the hamstrings are relaxed and there is no stretching of the sciatic nerve. Thus, with the knees flexed to 90 degrees, sitting up from the reclining position is unimpeded and not painful; with knees extended, there is pain and limited motion (Kraus-Weber test). With vertebral disease, passive flexion of the hips is free, whereas flexion of the lumbar spine may be impeded and painful.

The most helpful signs in detecting nerve root compression are passive straight-leg raising (possible up to almost 90° in normal individuals) with the patient supine and variations of this test. Raising the straight leg places the sciatic nerve and its roots under tension, thereby producing radicular, radiating pain from the buttock through the posterior thigh if there is compression of these neural structures. This maneuver is the usual way in which compression of the L5 or S1 nerve root is detected (Lasègue sign), however, it may also cause an anterior rotation of the pelvis around a transverse axis, increasing stress on the lumbosacral joint and causing milder radiating pain if this joint is arthritic or otherwise diseased. Straight raising of the opposite leg (“crossed straight-leg raising,” Fajersztajn sign) may also cause pain on the affected side and is a more specific sign of prolapsed disc than is the Lasègue sign but far less sensitive. The many derivatives of the straight-leg raising sign are discussed in the section on lumbar disc disease further on and summarized in the review by Ropper and Zafonte. Asking the seated patient to extend the leg so that the sole of the foot can be inspected is a way of checking for a feigned Lasègue sign.

document (1) 

Elongation of the nerve root by straight-leg raising or by flexing the leg at the hip and extending it at the knee (Lasègue maneuver discussed earlier) is the most consistent of all pain-provoking signs. During straight-leg raising, the patient can distinguish between the discomfort of ordinary tautness of the hamstring and the sharper, less-familiar root pain, particularly when asked to compare the experience with that on the normal side. Many variations of the Lasègue maneuver have been described (with numerous eponyms), the most useful of which is accentuation of the pain by dorsiflexion of the foot (Bragard sign) or of the great toe (Sicard sign). The Lasègue maneuver with the healthy leg may evoke sciatic pain on the contralateral side), but usually of lesser degree (Fajersztajn sign). However, the presence of the “crossed straight-leg-raising sign” is highly indicative of a ruptured disc as the cause of sciatica (Hudgkins). With the patient standing, forward bending of the trunk will cause flexion of the knee on the affected side (Neri sign). Sciatica may be provoked by forced flexion of the head and neck, coughing, or pressure on both jugular veins, all of which increase the intraspinal pressure (Naffziger sign). Marked inconsistencies in response to these tests raise the suspicion of psychologic factors or of referred muscular pain.

An antalgic posture, referred to as sciatic scoliosis, is maintained by reflex contraction of the paraspinal muscles, which can be both seen and palpated. In walking, the knee is slightly flexed, and weight bearing on the painful leg is brief and cautious on the ball of the foot, giving a limp. It is particularly painful for the patient to go up and down stairs.

The signs of more severe spinal root compression are impairment of sensation, loss or diminution of tendon reflexes, and muscle weakness, as summarized in

Table 10-1.

The pain of herniated intervertebral disc varies in severity from a mild aching discomfort to severe knife-like stabs that radiate the length of the leg and are superimposed on a constant intense ache. Sciatic pain is perceived by the patient as originating deep in the buttock and radiating to the posterolateral thigh; it may progress to the calf and ankle—to the medial malleolus (L4), lateral malleolus (L5), or heel (S1). Distal radiation to the foot is infrequent and should raise concern of an alternative process. Abortive forms of sciatica may produce aching discomfort only in the lower buttock or proximal thigh and occasionally only in the lower hamstring or upper calf. With the most severe pain, the patient is forced to stay in bed, avoiding the slightest movement; a cough, sneeze, or strain is intolerable. The most comfortable position is lying on the back with legs flexed at the knees and hips and the shoulders raised on pillows to obliterate the lumbar lordosis. For some patients, a lateral decubitus position is more comfortable. Free fragments of disc that find their way to a lateral and posterior position in the spinal canal may produce the opposite situation, one whereby the patient is unable to extend the spine and lie supine. Sitting and standing up from a sitting position are particularly painful. It is surprising to patients that a lumbar disc protrusion may cause little or no back pain. As a corollary, the presence of lumbar disc disease, even frank rupture, bears an inconsistent relationship to low back pain, as already emphasized.

In cases of root compression, pain is also characteristically provoked by pressure along the course of the sciatic nerve at the classic points of Valleix (sciatic notch, retrotrochanteric gutter, posterior surface of thigh, and head of fibula). Pressure at one point may cause radiation of pain and tingling down the leg.

Kassir, 2017). But, in properly selected patients, long-term inpatient care does not appear to add beneits compared with outpatient management (Neilson, 2003). In one random ized study of 53 women who had a bleeding previa at 24 to 36 weeks' gestation, maternal or fetal morbidity rates did not difer between management method (Wing, 1996). Of all study women, 60 percent had recurrent bleeding, and half eventually required expeditious cesarean delivery.

For women who are near term and who are not bleeding, plns re made for scheduled cesarean delivery. Timing balances fetal immaturity risks against antepartum hemorrhage. One NIH workshop suggested elective delivery at 36 to 37 completed weeks' gestation (Spong, 2011). he Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (2017) recommends delivery between 34 and 37 weeks. At Park land Hospital, we usually perform elective cesarean delivery at 38 weeks. With a suspected morbidly adherent placenta, delivery is recommended at 34 to 35 completed weeks by the NIH workshop (p. 781). Our practice is to schedule delivery at 36 completed weeks.

Practically all women with placenta previa undergo cesarean delivery. Many surgeons recommend a vertical laparotomy incision to provide rapid entry in cases with torrential bleeding or operating space if hysterectomy is required. As discussed, cesarean delivery is emergently performed in more than half because of hemorrhage, for which about a fourth require blood transfusion (Boyle, 2009; Sabourin, 2012). Although a low transverse hysterotomy is usually possible, this may cause fetal bleeding if the placenta is implanted anteriorly and the placenta is incised. In such cases, fetal delivery should be expeditious (Silver, 2015a). A vertical uterine incision may be preferable in some instances. In either case, even when the incision extends through the placenta, maternal or fetal outcomes are rarely compromised.

Recognizing that the gestational age at which abnormalities are identified may afect pregnancy management options, providers may opt to perform the examination prior to 20 weeks. The many additional indications for second-and third-trimester sonography are listed in Table 10-5. The three examination types are standard, specialized-which includes targeted sonography, and limited.

The standard sonogram includes evaluation of fetal number and presentation, cardiac activity, amnionic fluid volume, placental position, fetal biometry, and fetal anatomy (American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine, 2013b). When technically feasible, the maternal cervix and adnexa are examined as clinically appropriate. Components are found in Table 10-3, and the fetal anatomical structures that should be evaluated are listed in Table 10-6. With twins or other multiples, documentation also includes the number of chorions and amnions, comparison of fetal sizes, estimation of amnionic luid volume within each sac, and fetal sex determination (Chap. 45, p. 868).

FIGURE 43-6 Algorithm for management of postterm pregnancy. (Summarized from American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,o201o6d.) complications to be normal. hus, no interventions are practiced solely based on fetal age until 42 completed weeks. With complications such as hypertension, decreased fetal movement, or oligohydramnios, labor induction is carried out. It is our view that large, randomized trials should be performed before otherwise uncomplicated 41-week gestations are routinely considered pathologically prolonged. In women in whom a certain gestational age is known, labor is induced at the completion of 42 weeks. Almost 90 percent of such women are induced successfully or enter labor within 2 days of induction. For those who do not deliver with the first induction, a second induction is performed within 3 days. lmost all women are delivered using this management plan, but in the unusual few who are not delivered, management decisions involve a third-or even more-induction versus cesarean delivery. Women classiied as having uncertain postterm pregnancies are managed with weekly nonstress fetal testing and assessment ofamnionic luid volume. Women with an AFI ;5 cm or with reports ofdiminished fetal movement undergo labor induction.

Labor is a particularly dangerous time for the postterm fetus.

Therefore, women whose pregnancies are known or suspected to be postterm ideally come to the hospital as soon as they suspect labor. While being evaluated for active labor, we monitored electronically for variations consistent with fetal compromise.

During labor, the decision to perform amniotomy is problematic. Further reduction in luid volume following amniotomy can enhance the possibility of cord compression. Conversely, after membrane rupture, a scalp electrode and an intrauterine pressure catheter can be placed. These usually provide more precise data concerning fetal heart rate and uterine contractions. Amniotomy also aids identification of thick meconium.

document (3) 

At each return visit, the well-being of mother and fetus are assessed (see Table 9-1). Fetal heart rate, growth, and activity and amnionic fluid volume are evaluated. Maternal blood pressure and weight and their extent of change are examined. Symptoms such as headache, altered vision, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, bleeding, vaginal luid leakage, and dysuria are sought. Mter 20 weeks' gestation, uterine examination measures size from the symphysis to the fundus. In late pregnancy, vaginal examination often provides valuable information that includes conirmation of the presenting part and its station, clinical estimation of pelvic capacity and configuration, amnionic luid volume adequacy, and cervical consistency, efacement, and dilatation (Chap. 22, p. 435).

Between 20 and 34 weeks' gestation, the height of the uterine fundus measured in centimeters correlates closely with gestational age in weeks Gimenez, 1983). his measurement is used to monitor fetal growth and amnionic fluid volume. It is measured along the abdominal wall from the top of the symphysis pubis to the top of the fundus. Importantly, the bladder must be emptied before fundal measurement (Worthen, 1980). Obesity or the presence of uterine masses such as leiomyomas may also limit fundal height accuracy. Moreover, using fundal height alone, fetal-growth restriction may be undiagnosed in up to a third of cases (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2015b; Haragan, 2015).

Instruments incorporating Doppler ultrasound are often used to easily detect fetal heart action, and in the absence of maternal obesity, heart sounds are almost always detectable by 10 weeks with such instruments (Chap. 10, p. 213). he fetal heart rate ranges from 11e0 to 160 beats per minute and is typically heard as a double sound. Using a standard nonampliied stethoscope, the fetal heart is audible by 20 weeks in 80 percent of women, and by 22 weeks, heart sounds are expected to be heard in all (Herbert, 1987). Because the fetus moves freely in amni onic fluid, the site on the maternal abdomen where fetal heart sounds can be heard best will vary.

Pneumonia Pneumonia is defined as inﬂammation of the distal lung that includes terminal airways, alveolar spaces, and the interstitium. Pneumonia may have multiple causes, including viral and bacterial infections or aspiration. Aspiration pneumonia is usually the result of depressed awareness commonly associated with the use of drugs and alcohol or anesthesia. Viral pneumonias are caused by multiple infectious agents, including inﬂuenza A or B, parainﬂuenza virus, or respiratory syncytial virus. Most viral syndromes are spread by aerosolization associated with coughing, sneezing, and even conversation. Incubation is short, requiring only 1 to 3 days before the acute onset of fever, chills, headache, fatigue, and myalgias. Symptom intensity is directly related to intensity of the host febrile reaction. Pneumonia develops in only 1% of patients who have a viral syndrome, but mortality rates may reach 30% in immunocompromised individuals and the elderly. An additional risk is the development of secondary bacterial pneumonias after the initial viral insult. These infections are more common in elderly patients and may explain the high fatality in this group (8). Staphylococcal pneumonias, which often arise from a previous viral infection, are extremely lethal regardless of patient age. The best treatment for viral pneumonia is prevention by immunization. Treatment is supportive and consists mostly of administration of antipyretics and ﬂuids.

Bacterial pneumonia is classified as either community acquired or nosocomial, and in many cases the classification determines prognosis and antibiotic therapy. Risk factors that contribute to mortality are chronic cardiopulmonary diseases, alcoholism, diabetes, renal failure, malignancy, and malnutrition. Prognostic features associated with poor outcome include greater than two lobe involvement, respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths per minute on presentation, severe hypoxemia (<60 mm Hg on room air), hypoalbuminemia, and septicemia. Pneumonia is a common cause of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a mortality rate between 50% and 70% (9,10).

Alveolar edema predominantly involves dependent portions of the lung, with diminished aeration and atelectasis. Collapse of large sections of dependent lung markedly decreases lung compliance. Consequently, intrapulmonary shunting and hypoxemia develop and the work of breathing increases, leading to dyspnea. The pathophysiologic alterations in alveolar spaces are exacerbated by microvascular occlusion that results in reductions in pulmonary arterial blood flow to ventilated portions of the lung (and thus in increased dead space) and in pulmonary hypertension. Thus, in addition to severe hypoxemia, hypercapnia secondary to an increase in pulmonary dead space is prominent in early ARDS.

The exudative phase encompasses the first 7 days of illness after exposure to a precipitating ARDS risk factor, with the patient experiencing the onset of respiratory symptoms. Although usually presenting within 12–36 h after the initial insult, symptoms can be delayed by 5–7 days. Dyspnea develops, with a sensation of rapid shallow breathing

FIGURE 322-1 Diagram illustrating the time course for the development and resolution of ARDS. The exudative phase is notable for early alveolar edema and neutrophil-rich leukocytic infiltration of the lungs, with subsequent formation of hyaline membranes from diffuse alveolar damage. Within 7 days, a proliferative phase ensues with prominent interstitial inflammation and early fibrotic changes. Approximately 3 weeks after the initial pulmonary injury, most patients recover. However, some patients enter the fibrotic phase, with substantial fibrosis and bullae formation.

Mechanism of action—NO2 is a relatively insoluble deep lung irritant. It is capable of producing pulmonary edema and acute adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Inhalation damages the lung infrastructure that produces the surfactant necessary to allow smooth and low-effort lung alveolar expansion. The type I cells of the alveoli appear to be the cells chiefly affected by acute low to moderate inhalation exposure. At higher exposure, both type I and type II alveolar cells are damaged. If only type I cells are damaged, after an acute period of severe distress, it is likely that treatment with modern ventilation equipment and medications will result in recovery. Some patients develop nonallergic asthma, or “twitchy airway” disease, after such a respiratory insult. If severe damage to the type I and type II alveolar cells occurs, replacement of the type I cells may be impaired; progressive fibrosis may ensue that eventually leads to bronchial ablation and alveolar collapse. This can result in permanent restrictive respiratory disease. In addition to the direct deep lung effect, long-term exposure to lower concentrations of nitrogen dioxide has been linked to cardiovascular disease, increased incidence of stroke, and other chronic disease.

The current PEL for NO2 is given in Table 56–1. Exposure to 25 ppm of NO2 is irritating to some individuals; 50 ppm is moderately irritating to the eyes and nose. Exposure for 1 hour to 50 ppm can cause pulmonary edema and perhaps subacute or chronic pulmonary lesions; 100 ppm can cause pulmonary edema and death.

2.

Clinical effects—The signs and symptoms of acute exposure to NO2 include irritation of the eyes and nose, cough, mucoid or frothy sputum production, dyspnea, and chest pain. Pulmonary edema may appear within 1–2 hours. In some individuals, the clinical signs may subside in about 2 weeks; the patient may then pass into a second stage of abruptly increasing severity, including recurring pulmonary edema and fibrotic destruction of terminal bronchioles (bronchiolitis obliterans). Chronic exposure of laboratory animals to 10–25 ppm NO2 has resulted in emphysematous changes; thus, chronic effects in humans are of concern.

The mainstays of therapy for type II respiratory failure are directed at reversing the underlying cause(s) of ventilatory failure. Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation with a tight-fitting facial or nasal mask, with avoidance of endotracheal intubation, often stabilizes these patients. This approach has been shown to be beneficial in treating patients with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; it has been tested less extensively in other kinds of respiratory failure but may be attempted nonetheless in the absence of contraindications (hemodynamic instability, inability to protect the airway, respiratory arrest).

ventilation may also be used to reverse regional atelectasis.

This form results from hypoperfusion of respiratory muscles in patients in shock. Normally, respiratory muscles consume <5% of total cardiac output and oxygen delivery. Patients in shock often experience respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema (e.g., in cardiogenic shock), lactic acidosis, and anemia. In this setting, up to 40% of cardiac output may be distributed to the respiratory muscles. Intubation and mechanical ventilation can allow redistribution of the cardiac output away from the respiratory muscles and back to vital organs while the shock is treated.

A 32-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with weakness and hypokalemia. The patient had been very healthy until 2 months previously when he developed intermittent leg weakness. His review of systems was otherwise negative. He denied drug or laxative abuse and was on no medications. Past medical history was unremarkable, with no history of neuromuscular disease. Family history was notable for a sister with thyroid disease. Physical examination was notable only for reduced deep tendon reflexes.

This patient developed hypokalemia due to a redistribution of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular compartments; this pathophysiology was readily apparent following calculation of the TTKG. The TTKG is calculated as (P × U )/(P ×

U ). The expected values for the TTKG are <3 in the presence of hypokalemia and >7–8 in the presence of hyperkalemia (see also Case 2 and Case 8). Alternatively, a urinary K+-to-creatinine ratio of >13 mmol/g creatinine (>1.5 mmol/mmol creatinine) is compatible with excessive renal K+ excretion. In this case, the calculated TTKG was 2.5, consistent with appropriate renal conservation of K+ and a nonrenal cause for hypokalemia. In the absence of significant gastrointestinal loss of K+, the patient was diagnosed with a “redistributive” subtype of hypokalemia.

The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly.

The plasma Na+ concentration on admission was 113 meq/L, with a creatinine of 2.35 (Table 64e-1). At hospital hour 7, the plasma Na+ concentration was 120 meq/L, potassium 5.4 meq/L, chloride 90 64e-5 meq/L, bicarbonate 22 meq/L, BUN 32 mg/dL, creatinine 2.02 mg/dL, glucose 89 mg/dL, total protein 5.0, and albumin 1.9. The hematocrit was 33.9, white count 7.6, and platelets 405. A morning cortisol was 19.5, with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 1.7. The patient was treated with 1 μg of intravenous DDAVP, along with 75 mL/h of intravenous half-normal saline. After the plasma Na+ concentration dropped to 116 meq/L, intravenous fluid was switched to normal saline at the same infusion rate. The subsequent results are shown in Table 64e-1.

This patient presented with hypovolemic hyponatremia and a “prerenal” reduction in GFR, with an increase in serum creatinine. She had experienced diarrhea for some time and manifested an orthostatic tachycardia after a liter of normal saline. As expected for hypovolemic hyponatremia, the urine Na+ concentration was <20 meq/L in the absence of congestive heart failure or other causes of hypervolemic hyponatremia, and she responded to saline hydration with an increase in plasma Na+ concentration and a decrease in creatinine.

May be asymptomatic or may present with confusion, lethargy, muscle cramps, hyporeﬂexia, and nausea.

Can progress to seizures, coma, or brain stem herniation.

Hyponatremia can be categorized according to serum and urine osmolality as well as by volume status (i.e., by clinical exam). Osmolality is classified as follows:

High (> 295 mEq/L): Hyperglycemia, hypertonic infusion (e.g., mannitol).

Normal (280–295 mEq/L): Hypertriglyceridemia, paraproteinemia (pseudohyponatremia).

Hypervolemic hyponatremia is caused by “nephrOSIS, cirrhOSIS, and cardiOSIS.” ■ Low (< 280 mEq/L): Applies to the majority of cases. Hypotonic etiolog ies are listed in Table 2.16-1.

Specific treatments are outlined in Table 2.16-1.

Chronic hyponatremia (> 72 hours’ duration) should be corrected slowly (no more than 0.5 mEq/L/hr) in order to prevent central pontine myelinolysis (symptoms include paraparesis/quadriparesis, dysarthria, and coma).

Serum potassium > 5 mEq/L. Etiologies are as follows:

Spurious: Hemolysis of blood samples, fist clenching during blood draws, delays in sample analysis, extreme leukocytosis or thrombocytosis.

Savio John, Daniel S. Pratt

Jaundice, or icterus, is a yellowish discoloration of tissue resulting from the deposition of bilirubin. Tissue deposition of bilirubin occurs only in the presence of serum hyperbilirubinemia and is a sign of either liver disease or, less often, a hemolytic disorder. The degree of serum bilirubin elevation can be estimated by physical examination. Slight increases in serum bilirubin level are best detected by examining the sclerae, which have a particular affinity for bilirubin due to their high elastin content. The presence of scleral icterus indicates a serum bilirubin level of at least 51 μmol/L (3 mg/dL). The ability to detect scleral icterus is made more difficult if the examining room has fluorescent lighting. If the examiner suspects scleral icterus, a second site to examine is underneath the tongue. As serum bilirubin levels rise, the skin will eventually become yellow in light-skinned patients and even green if the process is long-standing; the green color is produced by oxidation of bilirubin to biliverdin.

The differential diagnosis for yellowing of the skin is limited. In addition to jaundice, it includes carotenoderma, the use of the drug quinacrine, and excessive exposure to phenols. Carotenoderma is the yellow color imparted to the skin of healthy individuals who ingest excessive amounts of vegetables and fruits that contain carotene, such as carrots, leafy vegetables, squash, peaches, and oranges. In jaundice the yellow coloration of the skin is uniformly distributed over the body, whereas in carotenoderma the pigment is concentrated on the palms, soles, forehead, and nasolabial folds. Carotenoderma can be distinguished from jaundice by the sparing of the sclerae. Quinacrine causes a yellow discoloration of the skin in 4–37% of patients treated with it.

bleeding usually prompts a woman to seek medical attention, infrequent or absent bleeding may seem less troubling and the patient may not bring it to the attention of the physician. Thus, a focused menstrual history is a critical part of every encounter with a female patient. Pelvic pain is a common complaint that may relate to an abnormality of the reproductive organs but also may be of gastrointestinal, urinary tract, or musculoskeletal origin. Depending on its cause, pelvic pain may require urgent surgical attention.

Amenorrhea refers to the absence of menstrual periods. Amenorrhea is classified as primary if menstrual bleeding has never occurred in the absence of hormonal treatment or secondary if menstrual periods cease for 3–6 months. Primary amenorrhea is a rare disorder that occurs in <1% of the female population. However, between 3 and 5% of women experience at least 3 months of secondary amenorrhea in any specific year. There is no evidence that race or ethnicity influences the prevalence of amenorrhea. However, because of the importance of adequate nutrition for normal reproductive function, both the age at menarche and the prevalence of secondary amenorrhea vary significantly in different parts of the world.

Oligomenorrhea is defined as a cycle length >35 days or <10 menses per year. Both the frequency and the amount of vaginal bleeding are irregular in oligomenorrhea, and moliminal symptoms (premenstrual breast tenderness, food cravings, mood lability), suggestive of ovulation, are variably present. Anovulation can also present with intermenstrual 335 intervals <24 days or vaginal bleeding for >7 days. Frequent or heavy irregular bleeding is termed dysfunctional uterine bleeding if anatomic uterine and outflow tract lesions or a bleeding diathesis has been excluded.

In our experience, delusions are more common in older patients and tend to appear only after weeks or months of more typical symptoms of depression. Common ones in experience with our patients have been gas poisoning in the house, unaccustomed suspiciousness, alleged home break ins, having inadequate money, or being stolen from or cheated. (Some of these arise in early dementia as well.) Hallucinations, when they occur, are

Mood symptoms and full mood episodes are common in schizophrenia and may be con- current with active-phase symptomatology. However, as distinct from a psychotic mood dis- order, a schizophrenia diagnosis requires the presence of delusions or hallucinations in the absence of mood episodes. In addition, mood episodes, taken in total, should be present for only a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.

In addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the assessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making crit- ically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psy- chotic disorders.

Individuals with schizophrenia may display inappropriate affect (e.g., laughing in the ab- sence of an appropriate stimulus); a dysphoric mood that can take the form of depression, anxiety, or anger; a disturbed sleep pattern (e.g., daytime sleeping and nighttime activity); and a lack of interest in eating or food refusal. Depersonalization, derealization, and so- matic concerns may occur and sometimes reach delusional proportions. Anxiety and pho- bias are common. Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are common and are strongly linked to vocational and functional impairments. These deficits can include decrements in declar- ative memory, working memory, language function, and other executive functions, as well as slower processing speed. Abnormalities in sensory processing and inhibitory capacity, as well as reductions in attention, are also found. Some individuals with schizophrenia show social cognition deficits, including deficits in the ability to infer the intentions of other people (theory of mind), and may attend to and then interpret irrelevant events or stimuli as meaningful, perhaps leading to the generation of explanatory delusions. These impairments frequently persist during symptomatic remission.

document (2) 

Some individuals with psychosis may lack insight or awareness of their disorder (i.e., anosognosia). This lack of ”insight" includes unawareness of symptoms of schizophrenia and may be present throughout the entire course of the illness. Unawareness of illness is typically a symptom of schizophrenia itself rather than a coping strategy. It is comparable to the lack of awareness of neurological deficits following brain damage, termed anosa— gnosia. This symptom is the most common predictor of non-adherence to treatment, and it predicts higher relapse rates, increased number of involuntary treatments, poorer psycho- social functioning, aggression, and a poorer course of illness.

Hostility and aggression can be associated with schizophrenia, although spontaneous or random assault is uncommon. Aggression is more frequent for younger males and for individuals with a past history of violence, non-adherence with treatment, substance abuse, and impulsivity. It should be noted that the vast majority of persons with schizo- phrenia are not aggressive and are more frequently victimized than are individuals in the general population.

Currently, there are no radiological, laboratory, or psychometric tests for the disorder.

Differences are evident in multiple brain regions between groups of healthy individuals and persons with schizophrenia, including evidence from neuroimaging, neuropatholog- ical, and neurophysiological studies. Differences are also evident in cellular architecture,

White matter connectivity, and gray matter volume in a variety of regions such as the pre- frontal and temporal cortices. Reduced overall brain volume has been observed, as well as increased brain volume reduction with age. Brain volume reductions with age are more pronounced in individuals with schizophrenia than in healthy individuals. Finally, indi- viduals with schizophrenia appear to differ from individuals without the disorder in eye- tracking and electrophysiological indices.

Neurological soft signs common in individuals with schizophrenia include impairments in motor coordination, sensory integration, and motor sequencing of complex movements; left-right confusion; and disinhibition of associated movements. In addition, minor phys- ical anomalies of the face and limbs may occur.

This condition occurs far more commonly in children (average age, 4 to 6 years) than in adults, and is often associated with nocturnal enuresis and night terrors, as indicated previously. It is estimated that 15 percent of children have at least one episode of sleepwalking, and that 1 in 5 sleepwalkers has a family history of this disorder. Motor performance and responsiveness during the sleepwalking incident vary considerably. The most common behavioral abnormality is for a patient to sit up in bed or on the edge of the bed without actually walking. When walking about the house, he may turn on a light or perform some other familiar act. There may be no outward show of emotion, or the patient may be frightened (night terror), but the frenzied, aggressive behavior of some adult sleepwalkers, described below, is rare in the child. Usually the eyes are open, and such sleepwalkers are guided by vision, thus avoiding familiar objects; the sight of an unfamiliar object may awaken them. Sometimes they make no attempt to avoid obstacles and may injure themselves. If spoken to, they make no response; if told to return to bed, they may do so, but more often they must be led back. Sometimes they repeatedly mutter strange phrases or perform certain repetitive acts, such as pushing against a wall or turning a doorknob back and forth. The episode lasts for only a few minutes, and the following morning, they usually have no memory of it, or only a fragmentary recollection.

A popular belief is that the sleepwalker is acting out a dream. The observations of sleep laboratories are entirely at variance with this view, as somnambulism has been found to occur almost exclusively during deeper stages of NREM sleep (stage N3) and during the first third of the night when dreaming is least likely to occur. In fact, the entire nocturnal sleep pattern of such individuals does not differ from normal. Also, there is no evidence that somnambulism is a form of epilepsy. It is probably allied to talking in one’s sleep, although the two conditions seldom occur together. Sleepwalking must be distinguished from fugue states and ambulatory automatisms of complex partial seizures discussed below and in Chap. 15.

The depressed patient tends to move slowly, sighing is frequent, and speech is reduced. The mental life of such an individual may narrow to a single-minded concern about physical or mental health. In dialogue, the patient’s responses become so stereotyped that the listener can soon predict exactly what is going to be said. There is a poverty of ideation and sometimes a notable absence of insight. Consciousness is clear, and although there is no evidence of a schizophrenic type of thought disorder, delusional ideas, and less often hallucinations, may be prominent in some patients, justifying the term

Patients with pelvic appendicitis are more likely to present with dysuria, urinary frequency, diarrhea, or tenesmus. They may only experience pain in the suprapubic region on palpation or on rectal or pelvic examination. A pelvic examination in women is mandatory to rule out conditions affecting urogynecologic organs that can cause abdominal pain and mimic appendicitis such as pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and ovarian torsion. The relative frequencies of some presenting signs are displayed in Table 356-3.

Patients with simple appendicitis normally only appear mildly ill with a pulse and temperature that are usually only slightly above normal. The provider should be concerned about other disease processes beside appendicitis or the presence of complications such as perforation, phlegmon, or abscess formation if the temperature is >38.3°C (~101°F) and if there are rigors.

Patients with appendicitis will be found to lie quite still to avoid peritoneal irritation caused by movement, and some will report discomfort caused by a bumpy car ride on the way to the hospital or clinic, coughing, sneezing, or other actions that replicate a Valsalva maneuver. The entire abdomen should be examined systematically starting in an area where the patient does not report discomfort if possible. Classically, maximal tenderness is identified in the right lower quadrant at or near McBurney’s point, which is located approximately one-third of the way along a line originating at the anterior iliac spine and running to the umbilicus. Gentle pressure in the left lower quadrant may elicit pain in the right lower quadrant if the appendix is located there. This is Rovsing’s sign (Table 356-4). Evidence of parietal peritoneal irritation is often best elicited by gentle abdominal percussion, jiggling the patient’s gurney or bed, or mildly bumping the feet.

case of pediatric patients. Inflammation of the visceral peritoneum usually progresses to the parietal perito-neum, presenting with migratory pain, which is a classic sign of appendicitis (likelihood ratio+, 2.06 [1.63–2.60]).14 Inflam-mation can often result in anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and fever (Table 30-1). Regional inflammation can also present with an ileus, diarrhea, small bowel obstruction, and hematuria. Perti-nent negative history (including menstrual) must be obtained to rule out other etiologies of abdominal pain.Physical ExaminationMost patients lay quite still due to parietal peritonitis.

Prevention is key and involves routinely moving bedridden patients and using special beds that distribute pressure. Once an ulcer has developed, low-grade lesions can be treated with routine wound care, including hydrocolloid dressings. High-grade lesions require surgical debridement.

Defined as necrosis of body tissue. There are three subtypes: dry, wet, and gas. The presence of one subtype does not exclude the others. Etiologies are as follows:

Dry gangrene: Due to insufficient blood ﬂow to tissue, typically from atherosclerosis.

Wet gangrene: Involves bacterial infection, usually with skin ﬂ ora.

Gas gangrene: Due to Clostridium perfringens infection.

Dry gangrene: Early signs are a dull ache, cold, and pallor of the ﬂ esh. As necrosis sets in, the tissue (usually a toe) becomes bluish-black, dry, and shriveled. Diabetes, vasculopathy, and smoking are risk factors.

Wet gangrene: The tissue appears bruised, swollen, or blistered with pus.

Gas gangrene: Typically occurs at a site of recent injury or surgery, presenting with swelling around the injury and with skin that turns pale and then dark red. Bacteria are rapidly destructive of tissue, producing gas that separates healthy tissue and exposes it to infection. A medical emergency.

Diagnosed by clinical impression.

Surgical debridement, with amputation if necessary, is the mainstay of treatment. Antibiotics alone do not suffice by virtue of inadequate blood ﬂow, but they should be given as an adjuvant to surgery.

Gas gangrene can be treated with hyperbaric oxygen, which is toxic to the anaerobic C. perfringens. Susceptible patients should maintain careful foot care and should avoid trauma.

A condition in which the skin in the intertriginous zones (genital and axillary regions and especially the nape of the neck) is hyperkeratotic and hyperpigmented with a velvety appearance (see Figure 2.2-12).

Scabies is caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The female mite burrows into the epidermis and deposits her eggs, which mature in 10 to 14 days. The disease is highly contagious because infested humans do not manifest the typical signs or symptoms for 3 to 4 weeks, facilitating transmission. An immunocompetent person with scabies typically harbors only 10 to 20 mites.

The clinical presentation varies depending on the age of the patient, duration of infestation, and immune status of the patient. Severe and paroxysmal itching is the hallmark, with complaints of itching that is frequently worse than the eruption would suggest. Most children exhibit an eczematous eruption composed of red, excoriated papules and nodules. The classic linear papule or burrow is often difficult to find. Distribution is the most diagnostic finding; the papules are found in the axillae, umbilicus, groin, penis, instep of the foot, and web spaces of the fingers and toes (Fig. 196-1). Infants infested with scabies have diffuse erythema, scaling, and pinpoint papules. Pustules, vesicles, and nodules are much more common in infants and may be more diffusely distributed. The face and scalp usually are spared in adults and older children, but these areas are usually involved in infants. Nodular lesions may represent active infection or prolonged hypersensitivity lesions following resolution of infestation. Immunocompromised or neurologically impaired persons may develop a severe form of the disease known as Norwegian or crusted scabies, with infestation of 2 million live mites at one time.

Figure 196-1 Scabies (hand).

The diagnosis of scabies can be confirmed by microscopic visualization of the mite, eggs, larvae, or feces in scrapings of papules or burrows examined under oil immersion. Skin biopsy is rarely necessary but may be useful if lesions have become nodular.

In the treatment of pain disorders, modest doses of TCAs are often sufficient. For example, 25–50 mg/d of imipramine might be beneficial in the treatment of pain associated with a neuropathy, but this would be a subtherapeutic dose in the treatment of MDD. In contrast, SNRIs are usually prescribed in pain disorders at the same doses used in the treatment of depression.

Although some potential adverse effects are common to all antidepressants, most of their adverse effects are specific to a subclass of agents and to their pharmacodynamic effects. An FDA warning applied to all antidepressants is the risk of increased suicidality in patients younger than 25. The warning suggests that use of antidepressants is associated with suicidal ideation and gestures, but not completed suicides, in up to 4% of patients under 25 who were prescribed antidepressant in clinical trials. This rate is about twice the rate seen with placebo treatment. For those over 25, there is either no increased risk or a reduced risk of suicidal thoughts and gestures on antidepressants, particularly after age 65. Although a small minority of patients may experience a treatment-emergent increase in suicidal ideation with antidepressants, the absence of treatment of a major depressive episode in all age groups is a particularly important risk factor in completed suicides.

A. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors

The adverse effects of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants—the SSRIs—can be predicted from their potent inhibition of SERT. SSRIs enhance serotonergic tone, not just in the brain but throughout the body. Increased serotonergic activity in the gut is commonly associated with nausea, gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal symptoms. Gastrointestinal adverse effects usually emerge early in the course of treatment and tend to improve after the first week. Increasing serotonergic tone at the level of the spinal cord and above is associated with diminished sexual function and interest. As a result, at least 30–40% of patients treated with SSRIs report loss of libido, delayed orgasm, or diminished arousal. The sexual effects often persist as long as the patient remains on the antidepressant but may diminish with time.

home placement. The newer generation of atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, quetiapine, and olanzapine, are being used in low doses to treat these neuropsychiatric symptoms. The few controlled studies comparing drugs against behavioral intervention in the treatment of agitation suggest mild efficacy with significant side effects related to sleep, gait, and cardiovascular complications, including an increased risk of death. All antipsychotics carry a black box FDA warning and should be used with caution in the demented elderly; however, careful, daily, nonpharmacologic behavior management is often not available, rendering medications necessary for some patients.

Although most controlled studies have evaluated lamotrigine as add-on therapy, the drug is effective as monotherapy for focal seizures, and lamotrigine is now widely prescribed for this indication because of its excellent tolerability. Despite being less effective than ethosuximide and valproate for absence epilepsy, lamotrigine may be prescribed because of its tolerability or in females of childbearing age because it has fewer fetal risks than valproate. Lamotrigine is also approved for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures and generalized seizures of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Adverse effects include dizziness, headache, diplopia, nausea, insomnia,

the patient, but they can be severe and disabling, particularly in the context of an underlying psychiatric disorder. Atypical antipsychotics (e.g., clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole) are thought to be associated with a lower risk of TD in comparison to traditional antipsychotics, although this remains to be established in controlled studies. Younger patients have a lower risk of developing neuroleptic-induced TD, whereas the elderly, females, and those with underlying organic cerebral dysfunction have been reported to be at greater risk. Chronic use is associated with increased risk, and specifically, the

diplopia, nausea, insomnia, somnolence, and skin rash. The rash is a typical hypersensitivity reaction. Although the risk of rash may be diminished by introducing the drug slowly, pediatric patients are at greater risk. Serious rash occurs in approximately 0.3–0.8% of children age 2–17 years, whereas in adults, the rate is 0.08–0.3%.

Isolated premature menarche is vaginal bleeding at age 1 to 9 years in the absence of other signs of puberty. The bleeding is usually limited to a few days. It can recur for 1 to 6 years and then cease. The etiology is uncertain. Most cases are associated with subsequent normal pubertal development and fertility. The differential diagnosis includes vaginal foreign bodies, trauma, sexual abuse, vaginal infection, or neoplasms such as rhabdomyosarcoma, McCune-Albright syndrome (in which menarche may occur before other manifestations of sexual precocity), and primary hypothyroidism.

In central precocious puberty, GnRH prematurely stimulates increased gonadotropin secretion. Central precocious puberty may occur in children in whom there is no structural abnormality, in which case it is termed constitutional or idiopathic. Constitutional (idiopathic) sexual precocity is the most common cause of precocious puberty. It is often familial and represents the so-called tail of the Gaussian curve (i.e., the early 2.5% for the age distribution for the onset of puberty). In many of these girls, puberty is slowly progressive, but in a few, development progresses rapidly. The major complication of sexual precocity is limitation of height. Thus, therapy may be warranted to prevent this consequence.

Pubertal development began at about 5 years of age.

Abnormal bleeding, either intermenstrual or postcoital, can be caused by cervical lesions. Bleeding can result from endocervical polyps and infectious cervical lesions, such as condylomata, herpes simplex virus ulcerations, chlamydial cervicitis, or cervicitis caused by other organisms. Other benign cervical lesions, such as wide eversion of endocervical columnar epithelium or nabothian cysts, may be detected on examination but rarely cause bleeding.

Diagnosis of Abnormal Bleeding in Reproductive-Age Women

Coagulopathies and Other Hematologic Causes of Abnormal in Reproductive-Age Women As with adolescents, hematologic causes of abnormal bleeding should be considered in women with heavy menstrual bleeding, particularly in those who had abnormal bleeding since menarche. Of all women with menorrhagia, 5% to 20% have a previously undiagnosed bleeding disorder, primarily von Willebrand’s disease (171). Table 14.8 presents guidelines for a gynecologist’s suspicion of a bleeding disorder and pursuit of a diagnosis (81). Abnormal liver function, which can be seen with alcoholism or other chronic liver diseases, results in inadequate production of clotting factors and can lead to excessive menstrual bleeding.

Infections Causes As in adolescents, menorrhagia can be the first sign of endometritis in women infected with sexually transmissible organisms. Women with cervicitis, particularly chlamydial cervicitis, can experience irregular bleeding and postcoital spotting (see Chapter 18). Therefore, cervical testing for C. trachomatis should be considered, especially for adolescents, women in their 20s, and women who are not in a monogamous relationship. Endometritis can cause excessive menstrual ﬂow. Thus, a woman who seeks treatment for menorrhagia and increased menstrual pain and has a history of light-to-moderate previous menstrual ﬂow may have an upper genital tract infection or PID (endometritis, salpingitis, oophoritis). Occasionally, chronic endometritis will be diagnosed when an endometrial biopsy is obtained for evaluation of abnormal bleeding in a patient without specific risk factors for PID.

Benign gynecologic conditions can present with a variety of signs and symptoms that vary by age. In this chapter, the most likely causes of specific signs and symptoms, as well as diagnosis and management, are described for each age group: prepubertal, adolescent, reproductive age, and postmenopausal women. The common gynecologic problems include those that cause pain, bleeding, pelvic masses (which may be symptomatic or asymptomatic), as well as vulvar and vaginal symptoms. Benign conditions of the female genital tract include anatomic lesions of the uterine corpus and cervix, ovaries, fallopian tubes, vagina, and vulva. A classification of benign lesions of the vulva, vagina, and cervix appears in Table 14.1. Leiomyoma, polyps, and hyperplasia are the most common benign conditions of the uterus in adult women. Benign uterine leiomyoma (uterine fibroids) are presented in Chapter 15. Benign tumors of the ovaries are listed in Table 14.2. Malignant diseases are presented in Chapters 35–40.

Prepubertal Bleeding Prior to menarche, which normally does not occur before nine years of age, any bleeding requires evaluation. To appropriately evaluate a young girl with vaginal bleeding, a practitioner should understand the events of puberty (1–4). The hormonal changes that control the

Other important hormonal changes also occur in conjunction with puberty. Growth hormone (GH) levels increase early in puberty, stimulated in part by the pubertal increases in estrogen secretion. GH increases insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), which enhances linear growth. The growth spurt is generally less pronounced in girls than in boys, with a peak growth velocity of ~7 cm/year. Linear growth is ultimately limited by closure of epiphyses in the long bones as a result of prolonged exposure to estrogen. Puberty is also associated with mild insulin resistance.

Disorders of the Female Reproductive System length counted from the first day of menses to the first day of subsequent menses is ~28 days, with a range of 25–35 days. However, cycle-to-cycle variability for an individual

Onset of Breast/ Age of Peak woman is ±2 days. Luteal phase length is relatively constant between 12 and 14 days in normal cycles; thus, the major variability in cycle length is due to variations in the fol-White 10.2 11.9 12.6 14.3 17.1 licular phase.

Abbreviations: CNS, central nervous system; GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone; hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin.

The differential diagnosis of precocious and delayed puberty is similar in boys (Chap. 411) and girls. However, there are differences in the timing of normal puberty and differences in the relative frequency of specific disorders in girls compared with boys.

Precocious Puberty Traditionally, precocious puberty has been defined as the development of secondary sexual characteristics before the age of 8 in girls based on data from Marshall and Tanner in British girls studied in the 1960s. More recent studies led to recommendations that girls be evaluated for precocious puberty if breast development or pubic hair is present at <7 years of age for white girls or <6 years for black girls.

Ofaboratory tests, ibrinogen, fibrin, and degradation product leves can be informative. In late pregnancy, plasma fibrinogen levels typicallyhave risen to 300 to 600 mg/dL. Even with severe consumptive coagulopathy, levels may sometimes be suiciently high to protect against clinically signiicant hypofibrinogenemia. For example, deibrination caused by a placental abruption might lower an initial fibrinogen level of 600 mg/dL to 250 mg/dL. Although this would indicate massive ibrinogen consumption, levels are still adequate to promote clinical coagulationusually about 150 mg/dL. If serious hypoibrinogenemia-less than 50 mg/dL-is present, the clot formed from whole blood in a glass tube may initially be sot but not necessarily remarkably reduced in volume. Then, over the next half hour or so, as platelet-induced clot retraction develops, the clot becomes quite small. When many ofthe erythrocytes are extruded, the volume ofliquid in the tube clearlyexceeds that ofclot.

As depicted in Figure 41-29, fibrinolysis cleaves ibrin and ibrinogen into various fibrin degradation products that are detected by several sensitive assays. There are many fragment types, and monoclonal antibodies in assay kits usually measure D-dimers speciic for that assay. These values are always abnormally high with clinically significant consumptive coagulopathy. At least in obstetrical disorders, quantiication has not been correlated with outcomes. Examples of the magnitude of ibrin split product elevations in various obstetrical coagulopathies is shown in Figure 41-30.

Thrombocytopenia is likely if petechiae are abundant or if clotted blood fails to retract within an hour or so. Conirmation is provided by a low platelet count. Ifsevere preeclampsia syndrome is comorbid, there may also be qualitative platelet dysfunction (Chap. 40, p. 719).

OSHA requires regular testing of lead-exposed workers with removal if BPb >40 μg/dL. New guidelines have been proposed recommending that BPb be maintained at <10 μg/dL, removal of workers if BPb >20 μg/dL, and monitoring of cumulative exposure parameters.

Attention should be focused on the position of the GEJ, when seen, to differentiate it from a type II hernia (see Fig. 25-39B and C). Fiber-optic esophagos-copy is useful in the diagnosis and classification of a hiatal hernia because the scope can be retroflexed.

Occasionally, bands of tissue extend from the Meckel’s diverticulum to the anterior abdominal wall, and these may represent lead points around which internal hernias may develop. This is an important cause of intestinal obstruction in the older child who has a scarless abdomen. Similar to dupli-cations, ectopic gastric mucosa may produce ileal ulcerations that bleed and lead to the passage of maroon-colored stools. Pancreatic mucosa may also be present. Diagnosis may be made by technetium pertechnetate scans when the patient presents with bleeding.

Pain arising from spinal nerves or roots comes and goes suddenly and is of a lancinating type (Chap. 22). It may be caused by herpes zoster, impingement by arthritis, tumors, a herniated nucleus pulposus, diabetes , or syphilis. It is not associated with food intake, abdominal distention, or changes in respiration. Severe muscle spasm, as in the gastric crises of tabes dorsalis, is common but is either relieved or not accentuated by abdominal palpation. The pain is made worse by movement of the spine and is usually confined to a few dermatomes. Hyperesthesia is very common.

Pain due to functional causes conforms to none of the aforementioned patterns. Mechanisms of disease are not clearly established. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. The diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical criteria (Chap. 352) and after exclusion of demonstrable structural abnormalities. The episodes of abdominal pain are often brought on by stress, and the pain varies considerably in type and location. Nausea and vomiting are rare. Localized tenderness and muscle spasm are inconsistent or absent. The causes of IBS or related functional disorders are not known.

Additional diagnostic markers relate to signs and symptoms that reﬂect the consequences often associated with persistent heavy drinking. For example, dyspepsia, nausea, and bloat— ing can accompany gastritis, and hepatomegaly, esophageal varices, and hemorrhoids may reﬂect alcohol-induced changes in the liver. Other physical signs of heavy drinking include tremor, unsteady gait, insomnia, and erectile dysfunction. Males with chronic alcohol use dis- order may exhibit decreased testicular size and feminizing effects associated with reduced testosterone levels. Repeated heavy drinking in females is associated with menstrual irregu- larities and, during pregnancy, spontaneous abortion and fetal alcohol syndrome. Individu- als with preexisting histories of epilepsy or severe head trauma are more likely to develop alcohol-related seizures. Alcohol withdrawal may be associated with nausea, vomiting, gas- tritis, hematemesis, dry mouth, puffy blotchy complexion, and mild peripheral edema.

Functional Consequences of Alcohol Use Disorder

The diagnostic features of alcohol use disorder highlight major areas of life functioning likely to be impaired. These include driving and operating machinery, school and work, interpersonal relationships and communication, and health. Alcohol-related disorders contribute to absenteeism from work, job-related accidents, and low employee productiv- ity. Rates are elevated in homeless individuals, perhaps reﬂecting a downward spiral in social and occupational functioning, although most individuals with alcohol use disorder continue to live with their families and function within their jobs.

Alcohol use disorder is associated with a significant increase in the risk of accidents, vi— olence, and suicide. It is estimated that one in five intensive care unit admissions in some urban hospitals is related to alcohol and that 40% of individuals in the United States ex- perience an alcohol-related adverse event at some time in their lives, with alcohol account- ing for up to 55% of fatal driving events. Severe alcohol use disorder, especially in individuals with antisocial personality disorder, is associated with the commission of criminal acts, including homicide. Severe problematic alcohol use also contributes to dis- inhibition and feelings of sadness and irritability, which contribute to suicide attempts and completed suicides.

In the treatment of pain disorders, modest doses of TCAs are often sufficient. For example, 25–50 mg/d of imipramine might be beneficial in the treatment of pain associated with a neuropathy, but this would be a subtherapeutic dose in the treatment of MDD. In contrast, SNRIs are usually prescribed in pain disorders at the same doses used in the treatment of depression.

Although some potential adverse effects are common to all antidepressants, most of their adverse effects are specific to a subclass of agents and to their pharmacodynamic effects. An FDA warning applied to all antidepressants is the risk of increased suicidality in patients younger than 25. The warning suggests that use of antidepressants is associated with suicidal ideation and gestures, but not completed suicides, in up to 4% of patients under 25 who were prescribed antidepressant in clinical trials. This rate is about twice the rate seen with placebo treatment. For those over 25, there is either no increased risk or a reduced risk of suicidal thoughts and gestures on antidepressants, particularly after age 65. Although a small minority of patients may experience a treatment-emergent increase in suicidal ideation with antidepressants, the absence of treatment of a major depressive episode in all age groups is a particularly important risk factor in completed suicides.

A. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors

The adverse effects of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants—the SSRIs—can be predicted from their potent inhibition of SERT. SSRIs enhance serotonergic tone, not just in the brain but throughout the body. Increased serotonergic activity in the gut is commonly associated with nausea, gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal symptoms. Gastrointestinal adverse effects usually emerge early in the course of treatment and tend to improve after the first week. Increasing serotonergic tone at the level of the spinal cord and above is associated with diminished sexual function and interest. As a result, at least 30–40% of patients treated with SSRIs report loss of libido, delayed orgasm, or diminished arousal. The sexual effects often persist as long as the patient remains on the antidepressant but may diminish with time.

Relatively low doses of alcohol (one or two drinks per day) have potential beneficial effects of increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and decreasing aggregation of platelets, with a resulting decrease in risk for occlusive coronary disease and embolic strokes. Red wine has additional potential health-promoting qualities at relatively low doses due to flavinols and related substances. Modest drinking might also decrease the risk for vascular dementia and, possibly, Alzheimer’s disease. However, any potential healthful effects disappear with the regular consumption of three or more drinks per day, and knowledge about the deleterious effects of alcohol can both help the physician to identify patients with an alcohol use disorder and to supply them with information that might help motivate a change in behavior.

Approximately 35% of drinkers (and a much higher proportion of alcoholics) experience a blackout, an episode of temporary anterograde amnesia, in which the person forgets all or part of what occurred during a drinking evening. Another common problem, one seen after as few as one or two drinks shortly before bedtime, is disturbed sleep. Although alcohol might initially help a person fall asleep, it disrupts sleep throughout the rest of the night. The stages of sleep are altered, and time spent in rapid eye movement (REM) and deep sleep is reduced. Alcohol relaxes muscles in the pharynx, which can cause snoring and exacerbate sleep apnea; symptoms of the latter occur in 75% of alcoholic men older than age 60 years. Patients may also experience prominent and sometimes disturbing dreams later in the night. All of these sleep problems are more pronounced in alcoholics, and their persistence may contribute to relapse.

Another common consequence of alcohol use is impaired judgment and coordination, increasing the risk of injury. In the United States, ~40% of drinkers have at some time driven while intoxicated. Heavy drinking can also be associated with headache, thirst, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue the following day, a hangover syndrome that is responsible for much missed time and temporary cognitive deficits at work and school.

document (3) 

The withdrawal symptoms typically begin when blood concentrations of alcohol decline sharply (i.e., within 4—12 hours) after alcohol use has been stopped or reduced. Reﬂecting the relatively fast metabolism of alcohol, symptoms of alcohol withdrawal usually peak in inten- sity during the second day of abstinence and are likely to improve markedly by the fourth or fifth day. Following acute withdrawal, however, symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, and auto- nomic dysfunction may persist for up to 3—6 months at lower levels of intensity.

Fewer than 10% of individuals who develop alcohol withdrawal will ever develop dra- matic symptoms (e.g., severe autonomic hyperactivity, tremors, alcohol withdrawal delir- ium). Tonic-clonic seizures occur in fewer than 3% of individuals.

Although confusion and changes in consciousness are not core criteria for alcohol with- drawal, alcohol withdrawal delirium (see ”Delirium” in the chapter "Neurocognitive Dis- orders”) may occur in the context of withdrawal. As is true for any agitated, confused state, regardless of the cause, in addition to a disturbance of consciousness and cognition, with- drawal delirium can include visual, tactile, or (rarely) auditory hallucinations (delirium tre- mens). When alcohol withdrawal delirium develops, it is likely that a clinically relevant medical condition may be present (e.g., liver failure, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding, sequelae of head trauma, hypoglycemia, an electrolyte imbalance, postoperative status).

It is estimated that approximately 50% of middle-class, highly functional individuals with alcohol use disorder have ever experienced a full alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Among individuals with alcohol use disorder who are hospitalized or homeless, the rate of al- cohol withdrawal may be greater than 80%. Less than 10% of individuals in withdrawal ever demonstrate alcohol withdrawal delirium or withdrawal seizures.

Acute alcohol withdrawal occurs as an episode usually lasting 4—5 days and only after extended periods of heavy drinking. Withdrawal is relatively rare in individuals younger than 30 years, and the risk and severity increase with increasing age.

Platelets may be deficient in both number and function. The normal peripheral blood count is 150,000 to 400,000 per mm3, and the normal lifespan of a platelet is approximately 10 days. Although there is no clear-cut correlation between the degree of thrombocytopenia and the presence or amount of bleeding, several generalizations can be made. If the platelet count is higher than 100,000/mm3 and the platelets are functioning normally, there is little chance of excessive bleeding during surgical procedures. Patients with a platelet count higher than 75,000/mm3 almost always have normal bleeding times, and a platelet count higher than 50,000/mm3 is probably adequate. A platelet count lower than 20,000/mm3 often will be associated with severe and spontaneous bleeding. Platelet counts higher than 1,000,000/mm3 are often, paradoxically, associated with bleeding.

If the patient’s platelet count is lower than 100,000/mm3 , an assessment of bleeding time should be obtained. If the bleeding time is abnormal and surgery must be performed, an attempt should be made to raise the platelet count by administering platelet transfusions immediately before surgery. In patients with immune destruction of platelets, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)–matched donor-specific platelets may be required to prevent rapid destruction of transfused platelets. If surgery can be postponed, a hematology consultation should be obtained to identify and treat the cause of the platelet abnormality.

Abnormally high or low white blood cell counts are not an absolute contraindication to surgery; they should be considered relative to the need for surgery. Evaluation of an elevated or decreased white blood cell count should be undertaken before elective surgery. Patients with absolute granulocyte counts lower than 1,000/mm3 are at increased risk of severe infection and perioperative morbidity and mortality and should undergo surgery only for life-threatening indications (234).

Packed red blood cells, which may be stored for several weeks, are used for most postoperative transfusions. Most clotting factors are stable for long periods. The exceptions are factors V and VIII, which decrease to 15% and 50% of normal, respectively. Most hematologic problems observed in the postoperative period are related to perioperative bleeding and blood component replacement. Although the primary cause of the bleeding is usually lack of surgical hemostasis, other factors, including deranged coagulation, may compound the problem. Such coagulopathy can result from massive transfusion (less than one blood volume) and is thought to be caused by dilution of platelets and labile coagulation factors by platelet-and factor-poor packed red blood cells (PRBCs), fibrinolysis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Areviewin Transfusion questioned the traditional practice of limiting blood component replacement in massive transfusion. Summarizing 14 articles and encompassing nearly 4,600 patients, the conclusions note a decrease in all-cause mortality with more liberal transfusion of platelets and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) (235).

A task force for the American Society of Anesthesiologists recommended critical values for replacement in patients with massive transfusion and microvascular bleeding (193): 1.

Platelet transfusion usually is indicated for counts less than 50,000/mm3 (with intermediate platelet counts, i.e., 50,000/mm3 to 100,000/mm3, the transfusion of platelet concentrates should be based on the risk of more significant bleeding).

Types of Ectopic Pregnancy

Spontaneous Resolution Some ectopic pregnancies resolve by resorption or by tubal abortion, obviating the need for medical or surgical therapy (221–225). The proportion of ectopic pregnancies that resolve spontaneously and the reason they do so while others do not are unknown. There are no specific criteria for patient selection that predict successful outcome after spontaneous resolution. A falling hCG level is the most common indicator used, but tubal rupture can occur even with falling hCG levels. Patients with low initial levels of β-hCG are generally the best candidates for expectant management, and there is a reported 88% success rate of spontaneous remission with an initial β-hCG level less than 200 mU/mL (226). These patients should be followed with serial β-hCG levels and active management initiated if these levels plateau or rise or the patient develops abdominal pain or signs of tubal rupture (190).

Persistent ectopic pregnancy occurs when a patient underwent conservative surgery (e.g., salpingostomy, fimbrial expression) and viable trophoblastic tissue remains. Histologically, there is no identifiable embryo, the implantation usually is medial to the previous tubal incision, and residual chorionic villi are confined to the tubal muscularis. Peritoneal trophoblastic tissue implants may be responsible for persistence (182,183,227–230).

Examination of the chest includes inspection of the chest wall to identify asymmetry resulting from absence of the pectoralis muscle and inspection of the breast tissue to determine gestational age and detect a breast abscess. Boys and girls may have breast engorgement and produce milk; milk expression should not be attempted. Supernumerary nipples may be bilateral and may be associated with renal anomalies.

Examination of the lungs includes observations of the rate, depth, and nature of intercostal or sternal retractions. Breath sounds should be equal on both sides of the chest, and rales should not be heard after the first 1 to 2 hours of life. Diminished or absent breath sounds on one side suggest pneumothorax, collapsed lung, pleural effusion, or diaphragmatic hernia. Shift of the cardiac impulse away from a tension pneumothorax and diaphragmatic hernia and toward the collapsed lung is a helpful physical finding for differentiating these disorders. Subcutaneous emphysema of the neck or chest also suggests a pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum, whereas bowel sounds auscultated in the chest in the presence of a scaphoid abdomen suggest a diaphragmatic hernia.

The position of the heart in infants is more midline than in older children. The first heart sound is normal, whereas the second heart sound may not be split in the first day of life. Decreased splitting of the second heart sound is noted in PPHN, transposition of the great vessels, and pulmonary atresia. Heart murmurs in newborns are common in the delivery room and during the first day of life. Most of these murmurs are transient and are due to closure of the ductus arteriosus, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, or a small ventral septal defect. Pulses should be palpated in the upper and lower extremities (over the brachial and femoral arteries). Blood pressure in the upper and lower extremities should be measured in all patients with a murmur or heart failure. An upperto-lower extremity gradient of more than 10 to 20 mm Hg suggests coarctation of the aorta.

Gait varies considerably from one to another and it is a commonplace observation that a person may be identified by the sound of his footsteps, notably the pace and the lightness or heaviness of tread, by their carriage at a distance, even before the person is recognizable by face. Obviously, the gaits of men and women differ, a woman’s steps being quicker and shorter. Sherlock Holmes expressed pride in his talent for deducing from the manner of gait, an individual’s personality and occupation. It is said that Charcot could often make the correct diagnosis, even before seeing the patient, based on the sound of patient walking down the hallway on the way to the examining room. The changes in stance and gait that accompany aging—the slightly stooped posture and slow, stiff tread as described in Chap. 28, on aging—are so familiar that they are not perceived as abnormalities.

The normal gait seldom attracts attention but it should be observed with care if slight deviations from normal are to be appreciated. The body is erect, the head is straight, and the arms hang loosely and gracefully at the sides, each moving rhythmically forward with the opposite leg. The feet are slightly externally rotated, the steps are approximately equal, and the medial malleoli almost touch as each foot passes the other. The medial edges of the heels, as they strike the ground with each step, lie almost along a straight line. As each leg moves forward, there is coordinated flexion of the hip and knee, dorsiflexion of the foot, and a barely perceptible elevation of the hip, so that the foot clears the ground. Also, with each step, the thorax advances slightly on the side opposite the swinging lower limb. The heel strikes the ground first, and inspection of the shoes will show that this part is most subject to wear.

Pulmonary–capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) equals the LAP, which equals LVEDP and is normal at 8 to 12 mm Hg. Because the standard pulmonary artery catheter has an incorporated thermistor, thermodilution studies can be performed to determine cardiac output. This thermodilution method is performed by injecting cold 5% dextrose in water through the proximal port of the catheter, which cools the blood entering the right atrium. The change in temperature measured at the more distal thermistor (4 cm from the catheter tip) generates a curve proportional to cardiac output. Knowledge of the cardiac output is helpful in establishing cardiovascular diagnoses. For example, a patient with hypotension, low-to-normal wedge pressure, and a cardiac output of 3 L per minute is most likely hypovolemic. The same patient with a cardiac output of 8 L per minute is probably septic with resultant low systemic vascular resistance.

Pulmonary artery catheters are associated with a small but significant complication rate. The complications can be grouped into those occurring during venous cannulation or insertion, during maintenance and use, and those related to interpretation of hemodynamic data (210). The most common problems encountered during venous access are cannulation of the carotid or subclavian artery and introduction of a pneumothorax. Problems resulting from the catheter itself include dysrhythmias, sepsis, and disruption of the pulmonary artery. Pulmonary artery catheters (PAC) should be placed under the supervision of experienced personnel in a setting in which complications can be rapidly diagnosed and treated. Accessory equipment such as resuscitation equipment and an external pacing device must be immediately available. Ultrasound and ﬂuoroscopic equipment if available may aid in PAC placement (211).

Chronic unremitting back pain may suggest the possibility of infection, malignancy, or metastatic disease.While radiographs are one option in the management of disabling low back pain, they are ineffective at ruling out malig-nancy, and radiographic findings correlate poorly with symp-toms.

Acute sprains and strains The terms lumbosacral strain, sprain, and derangement are used loosely and it is difficult to differentiate them. Furthermore, what was formerly referred to as “sacroiliac strain” or “sprain” is now known to be caused in some instances, by disc disease. The term acute low back strain may be preferable for minor, self-limiting injuries that are usually associated with lifting heavy loads when the back is in a mechanically disadvantaged position, or there may have been a fall, prolonged uncomfortable postures such as air travel or car rides, or sudden unexpected motion, as may occur in an auto accident.

Nonetheless, the discomfort of acute low back strain can be severe, and the patient may assume unusual postures related to spasm of the lower lumbar and sacrospinalis muscles. The pain is usually confined to the lower part of the back, in the midline, across the posterior waist, or just to one side of the spine. The diagnosis of lumbosacral strain is dependent on the biomechanics of the injury or activity that precipitated the pain. The injured structures are identified by the localized tenderness, augmentation of pain by postural changes—for example, bending forward, twisting, or standing up from a sitting position, and by the absence of signs of radicular involvement. In more than 80 percent of cases of acute low back strain of this type, the pain resolves in a matter of several days or a week, even with no specific treatment.

Sacroiliac joint and ligamentous strain is the most likely diagnosis when there is tenderness over the sacroiliac joint and pain radiating to the buttock and posterior thigh, but this needs to be distinguished from the sciatica of a ruptured intervertebral disc (see further on). Strain is characteristically worsened by abduction of the thigh against resistance and may produce pain that is also felt in the symphysis pubis or groin. It, too, responds within days or a week or two to conservative management.

Referred pain from structures of the lower back (sometimes called pseudoradicular) does not, as a rule, project below the knees and is not accompanied by neurologic changes other than sometimes a vague numbness without demonstrable sensory impairment. This is in contrast to the pain of root compression. Pain resulting from muscular spasm usually occurs in relation to local spinal irritation and may be thought of as a nocifensive reflex for the protection of the diseased parts against injurious motion. Chronic muscular contraction may give rise to a dull, sometimes cramping ache. One can sometimes feel the tautness of the sacrospinalis and gluteal muscles and demonstrate by palpation that the pain is localized to them. However, except for the most severe degrees of acute injuries of the back, the spasms are difficult to detect and their contribution to back pain has appeared to us to be relatively small.

In addition to assessing the character and location of the pain, one should determine the factors that aggravate and relieve it, its constancy, and its relationship to activity and to rest, posture, forward bending, coughing, sneezing, and straining. Frequently, the most important lead comes from knowledge of the mode of onset and the circumstances that initiated the pain. Inasmuch as many painful conditions of the back are the result of injuries incurred during work or in accidents, the possibility of exaggeration or prolongation of pain for purposes of compensation must be kept in mind.

Examination of the Lower Back

The main goals of the examination of the back are to differentiate pain that is caused by nerve root compression from musculoskeletal strains, metastatic spinal tumor, and infectious and inflammatory diseases of the spine and hips.

The pain of herniated intervertebral disc varies in severity from a mild aching discomfort to severe knife-like stabs that radiate the length of the leg and are superimposed on a constant intense ache. Sciatic pain is perceived by the patient as originating deep in the buttock and radiating to the posterolateral thigh; it may progress to the calf and ankle—to the medial malleolus (L4), lateral malleolus (L5), or heel (S1). Distal radiation to the foot is infrequent and should raise concern of an alternative process. Abortive forms of sciatica may produce aching discomfort only in the lower buttock or proximal thigh and occasionally only in the lower hamstring or upper calf. With the most severe pain, the patient is forced to stay in bed, avoiding the slightest movement; a cough, sneeze, or strain is intolerable. The most comfortable position is lying on the back with legs flexed at the knees and hips and the shoulders raised on pillows to obliterate the lumbar lordosis. For some patients, a lateral decubitus position is more comfortable. Free fragments of disc that find their way to a lateral and posterior position in the spinal canal may produce the opposite situation, one whereby the patient is unable to extend the spine and lie supine. Sitting and standing up from a sitting position are particularly painful. It is surprising to patients that a lumbar disc protrusion may cause little or no back pain. As a corollary, the presence of lumbar disc disease, even frank rupture, bears an inconsistent relationship to low back pain, as already emphasized.

In cases of root compression, pain is also characteristically provoked by pressure along the course of the sciatic nerve at the classic points of Valleix (sciatic notch, retrotrochanteric gutter, posterior surface of thigh, and head of fibula). Pressure at one point may cause radiation of pain and tingling down the leg.

The most common cause of death for infants 1 month to 1 year of age is motor vehicle crashes. No newborn should be discharged from a nursery unless the parents have a functioning and properly installed car seat. Many automobile dealerships offer services to parents to ensure that safety seats are installed properly in their specific model. Most states have laws that mandate use of safety seats until the child reaches 4 years of age or at least 40 pounds in weight. The following are age-appropriate recommendations for car safety:

Infants and toddlers should ride in a rear-facing safety seat until they are 2 years of age, or until they reach the highest weight or height allowed by the safety seat manufacturer.

Toddlers and preschoolers over age 2 or who have outgrown the rear-facing car seat should use a forward-facing car seat with harness for as long as possible, up to the highest weight or height recommended by the manufacturer.

School-age children, whose weight or height is above the forward-facing limit for their car seat, should use a belt-positioning booster seat until the vehicle seat belt fits properly, typically when they have reached 4 ft 9 in. in height and are between 8 and 12 years of age.

Older children should always use lap and shoulder seat belts for optimal protection. All children younger than 13 years should be restrained in the rear seats of vehicles for optimal protection. This is specifically to protect them from airbags, which may cause more injury than the crash in young children.

The Back to Sleep initiative has reduced the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Before the initiative, infantsroutinely were placed prone to sleep. Since 1992 when the AAPrecommended this program, the annual SIDS rate has decreasedby more than 50%. Another initiative is aimed at day care providers, because 20% of SIDS deaths occur in day care settings.

See Table 9-5 as well as the Bright Futures’ recommendations (found at http://brightfutures.aap.org/clinical_practice.html )for presentation of age-appropriate activities that the pediatrician may advocate for families.

This is the midpoint of pregnancy as estimated from the LMP. The fetus now weighs somewhat more than 300 g, and weight increases substantially in a linear manner. From this point onward, the fetus moves approximately every minute and is active 10 to 30 percent of the day (DiPietro, 2005). Brown fat forms, and the fetal skin becomes less transparent. Downy lanugo covers its entire body, and some scalp hair can be seen. Cochlear function develops between 22 and 25 weeks, and its maturation continues for 6 months after delivery.

The fetus now weighs almost 700 g (Duryea, 2014). he skin is characteristically wrinkled, and fat deposition begins. The head is still comparatively large, and eyebrows and eyelashes are usually recognizable. By 24 weeks, the secretory type II pneumocytes have initiated surfactant secretion (Chap. 32, p. 607). The canalicular period of lung development, during which the bronchi and bronchioles enlarge and alveolar ducts develop, is nearly completed. Despite this, a fetus born at this time will attempt to breathe, but many will die because the terminal sacs, required for gas exchange, have not yet formed. The overall survival rate at 24 weeks is barely above 50 percent, and only approximately 30 percent survive without severe morbidity (Rysavy, 2015). By 26 weeks, the eyes open. Nociceptors are present over all the body, and the neural pain system is developed (Kadic, 2012). The fetal liver and spleen are important sites for hemopoiesis.

The crown-rump length approximates 25 cm, and the fetus weighs about 1100 g. The thin skin is red and covered with vernix caseosa. The pupillary membrane has just disappeared from the eyes. Isolated eye blinking peaks at 28 weeks. The bone marrow becomes the major site of hemopoiesis. he otherwise normal neonate born at this age has a 90-percent chance of survival.without physical or neurological impairment.

Clinical manifestations of congenital hypothyroidism in the immediate newborn period usually are subtle but become more evident weeks or months after birth. By then it is too late to ensure that there is not a detriment to the infant’s cognitive development. Newborn screening is crucial to make an early diagnosis and initiate thyroid replacement therapy by younger than 1 month of age. Findings at various stages after birth include hypothermia, acrocyanosis, respiratory distress, large fontanels, abdominal distention, lethargy and poor feeding, prolonged jaundice, edema, umbilical hernia, mottled skin, constipation, large tongue, dry skin, and hoarse cry. Thyroid hormones are crucial for maturation and differentiation of tissues, such as bone and brain (most thyroid-dependent brain maturation occurs 2 to 3 years after birth) (Table 175-3).

When treatment (with levothyroxine) is initiated within 1 month or less after birth, the prognosis for normal intellectual development is excellent; screening programs usually offer therapy within 1 to 2 weeks of birth. If therapy is instituted after 6 months, when the signs of severe hypothyroidism are present, the likelihood of normal intellectual function is markedly decreased. Growth improves after thyroid replacement even in late diagnosed cases. The dose of levothyroxine changes with age; 10 to 15 μg/kg of levothyroxine is used for a newborn, but about 3 μg/kg is used later in childhood. In neonatal hypothyroidism, the goal is to bring the serum free T4 rapidly into the upper half of the range of normal. Suppression of TSH is not seen and not necessary in all cases because such suppression may lead to excessive doses of levothyroxine.

Newborns born before 37 weeks sufer various morbidities, largely due to organ system immaturity (Table 42-2). hat said, remarkable strides have been made in neonatal survival for those born preterm. his is especially true for neonates born after 28 weeks. In a study of more than 18,000 newborns weighing between 400 and 1500 g or aged between 22 and 32 weeks' gestation, survival rates were analyzed as a function of both birthweight and gestational age (Fanarof, 2007). Mter achieving a birthweight of : 1000 g or a gestational age of 28 weeks for females, or 30 weeks for males, survival rates reach 95 percent.

• Threshold of Viability

Births once considered to be "abortuses" because the fetus weighed <500 g are now classified as live births. In the United

States in 2014, 5863 live births <500 g were recorded (Martin, 2017). For those newborns delivered before 33 weeks' gesta tion, perinatal and neonatal care has advanced tremendously.

As a result, the threshold of viability, which is the lower limit of fetal maturation compatible with extrauterine survival, has been reassessed. Currently, the threshold of viability lies between 20 and 26 weeks' gestation.

Neonates born in this periviable period have been described as fragile and vulnerable because of their immature organ systems. Many of these are described in Chapter 34 (p. 639) and include brain injury from hypoxic-ischemic injury and sepsis. In this setting, hypoxia and sepsis start a cascade of events that lead to brain hemorrhage, to white-matter injury that causes periventricular leukomalacia, and to poor subsequent brain growth eventuating in neurodevelopmental impairment. Associated morbidities include intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, blindness, seizures, and spastic quadriparesis that can result in the need for a lifetime of medical care (Annas, 2004). Because active brain development normally occurs throughout the second and third trimesters, those born <25 weeks are believed to be especially vulnerable to brain injury.

This form of severe intrauterine hypothyroidism (in mother and fetus) or postnatally as a hereditary or acquired thyroid disease, is probably the most frequent and potentially preventable and correctable metabolic cause of encephalopathy in the world. Although the condition is most common in goitrous regions where there is a lack of iodine, it may also be the result of any of several genetically determined defects in thyroxin synthesis that have come to light (Vassart et al). In areas of endemic cretinism, additional factors may be operative, such as the widespread ingestion of cassava, which contains a toxic goitrogen that inhibits the uptake of iodine by the thyroid.

The symptoms and signs of congenital thyroid deficiency are not usually recognizable at birth but become apparent only after a few weeks; more often the diagnosis is first made between the 6th and 12th months of life. Physiologic jaundice tends to have been severe and prolonged (up to 3 months), and this, along with widening of the posterior fontanelle and mottling of the skin, should raise suspicion of the disease.

Two types of early life hypothyroidism are recognized—sporadic and endemic. The sporadic type occurs occasionally in developed countries (less than once in 4,000 live births) and is a consequence of a congenital metabolic or anatomic disorder of the thyroid gland. At birth, the gland is either absent or represented by cysts, indicating a failure of development or a destructive lesion. In the sporadic form, in the latter part of the first year, stunting of growth and delay in psychomotor development become evident. Untreated, the child is severely developmentally delayed but placid and good natured; such children sleep contentedly for longer periods than normal children. Sitting, standing, and walking are delayed. Movements are slow, and if tendon reflexes can be obtained, their relaxation time is clearly delayed. The body temperature is low, and the extremities are cold and cyanotic. Although the head is small, the fontanelles may not close until the sixth or seventh year, and there is delayed ossification. This type of hypothyroidism is preventable by treatment with thyroid hormone.

Bleeding from right colonic vascular ectasias in the elderly may be overt or occult; it tends to be chronic and only occasionally is hemodynamically significant. Endoscopic hemostatic therapy may be useful in the treatment of vascular ectasias, as well as discrete bleeding ulcers and postpolypectomy bleeding. Surgical therapy is generally required for major, persistent, or recurrent bleeding from the wide variety of colonic sources of GIB that cannot be treated medically, angiographically, or endoscopically.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT:

Measurement of the heart rate and blood pressure is the best way to initially assess a patient with GIB. Clinically significant bleeding leads to postural changes in heart rate or blood pressure, tachycardia, and, finally, recumbent hypotension. In contrast, the hemoglobin does not fall immediately with acute GIB, due to proportionate reductions in plasma and red cell volumes (i.e., “people bleed whole blood”). Thus, hemoglobin may be normal or only minimally decreased at the initial presentation of a severe bleeding episode. As extravascular fluid enters the vascular space to restore volume, the hemoglobin falls, but this process may take up to 72 h. Transfusion is recommended when the hemoglobin drops below 7 g/dL, based on a large randomized trial showing this restrictive transfusion strategy decreases rebleeding and death in acute UGIB compared with a transfusion threshold of 9 g/dL. Patients with slow, chronic GIB may have very low hemoglobin values despite normal blood pressure and heart rate. With the development of iron-deficiency anemia, the mean corpuscular volume will be low and red blood cell distribution width will increase.

GIB presents as either overt or occult bleeding. Overt GIB is manifested by hematemesis, vomitus of red blood or “coffee-grounds” material; melena, black, tarry, foul-smelling stool; and/or hematochezia, passage of bright red or maroon blood from the rectum. Occult GIB may be identified in the absence of overt bleeding when patients present with symptoms of blood loss or anemia such as lightheadedness, syncope, angina, or dyspnea; or when routine diagnostic evaluation reveals iron deficiency anemia or a positive fecal occult blood test. GIB is also categorized by the site of bleeding as UGIB, LGIB, or obscure GIB if the source is unclear.

SOuRCES OF gASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDINg upper gastrointestinal Sources of Bleeding (Table 57-1) Peptic ulcers are the most common cause of UGIB, accounting for ∼50% of cases. Mallory-Weiss tears account for ~5–10% of cases. The proportion of patients bleeding from varices varies widely from ~5–40%, depending on the population. Hemorrhagic or erosive gastropathy (e.g., due to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] or alcohol) and erosive esophagitis often cause mild UGIB, but major bleeding is rare.

PEPTIC ULCERS Characteristics of an ulcer at endoscopy provide important prognostic information. One-third of patients with active bleeding or a nonbleeding visible vessel have further bleeding that requires urgent surgery if they are treated conservatively. These patients benefit from endoscopic therapy with bipolar electrocoagulation, heater probe, injection therapy (e.g., absolute alcohol, 1:10,000 epinephrine), and/or clips with reductions in bleeding, hospital stay, mortality, and costs. In contrast, patients with clean-based ulcers have rates of recurrent bleeding approaching zero. If stable with no other reason for hospitalization, such patients may be discharged home after endoscopy. Patients without clean-based ulcers usually remain in the hospital for 3 days because most episodes of recurrent bleeding occur within 3 days.

ALF is a rare disorder affecting approximately 2000 patients annually in the United States.

CT can be performed. CT may also detect changes associated with advanced cirrhosis and portal hypertension (Fig. 59-1). Laboratory evaluation should include liver biochemical testing, serum albumin level measurement, and prothrombin time determina tion (international normalized ratio) to assess hepatic function as well as a complete blood count to evaluate for the presence of cytopenias that may result from portal hypertension or of leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytosis that may result from systemic infection. Serum amylase and lipase levels should be checked to evaluate the patient for acute pancreatitis. Urinary protein quantitation is indicated when nephrotic syndrome, which may cause ascites, is suspected.

FIguRE 59-1 CT of a patient with a cirrhotic, nodular liver (white arrow), splenomegaly (yellow arrow), and ascites (arrowheads).

In selected cases, the hepatic venous pressure gradient (pressure across the liver between the portal and hepatic veins) can be measured via cannulation of the hepatic vein to confirm that ascites is caused by cirrhosis (Chap. 365). In some cases, a liver biopsy may be necessary to confirm cirrhosis.

Ascites in patients with cirrhosis is the result of portal hypertension and renal salt and water retention. Similar mechanisms contribute to ascites formation in heart failure. Portal hypertension signifies elevation of the pressure within the portal vein. According to Ohm’s law, pressure is the product of resistance and flow. Increased hepatic resistance occurs by several mechanisms. First, the development of hepatic fibrosis, which defines cirrhosis, disrupts the normal architecture of the hepatic sinusoids and impedes normal blood flow through the liver. Second, activation of hepatic stellate cells, which mediate fibrogenesis, leads to smooth-muscle contraction and fibrosis. Finally, cirrhosis is associated with a decrease in endothelial nitric oxide synthetase (eNOS) production, which results in decreased nitric oxide production and increased intrahepatic vasoconstriction.

The segments remaining included the left lobe of the liver.

The patient underwent a surgical resection of segments V, VI, VII, and VIII. The remaining segments included IVa, IVb, I, II, and III. It is important to remember that the lobes of the liver do not correlate with the hepatic volume. The left lobe of the liver contains only segments II and III. The right lobe of the liver contains segments IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII. Hence, cross-sectional imaging is important when planning surgical segmental resection.

A 55-year-old man developed severe jaundice and a massively distended abdomen. A diagnosis of cirrhosis of the liver was made, and further confirmatory tests demonstrated that the patient had significant ascites (free fluid within the peritoneal cavity). A liver biopsy was necessary to confirm the cirrhosis, but there was some debate about how this biopsy should be obtained (eFig. 4.187).

In patients with cirrhosis it is important to determine the extent of the cirrhosis and the etiology.

History, examination, and blood tests are useful and are supported by complex radiological investigations. To begin treatment and determine the prognosis, a sample of liver tissue must be obtained. However, there are important issues to consider when taking a liver biopsy from a patient with suspected cirrhosis.

One issue is liver function.

The liver function of patients with suspected liver disease is poor, as demonstrated by the patient’s jaundice—an inability to conjugate bilirubin. Importantly, because some liver products are blood-clotting factors involved in the clotting cascade, the blood-clotting ability of patients with severe liver disease is significantly impaired. These patients therefore have a high risk of bleeding.

Another issue is the presence of ascites.

document (3) 

Hepatomegaly is not a highly reliable sign of liver disease because of variability in the liver’s size and shape and the physical impediments to assessment of liver size by percussion and palpation. Marked hepatomegaly is typical of cirrhosis, veno-occlusive disease, infiltrative disorders such as amyloidosis, metastatic or primary cancers of the liver, and alcoholic hepatitis. Careful assessment of the liver edge may also reveal unusual firmness, irregularity of the surface, or frank nodules. Perhaps the most reliable physical finding in the liver examination is hepatic tenderness. Discomfort when the liver is touched or pressed upon should be carefully sought with percussive comparison of the right and left upper quadrants.

Splenomegaly, which occurs in many medical conditions, can be a subtle but significant physical finding in liver disease. The availability of ultrasound methods for assessment of the spleen allows confirmation of the physical finding.

Signs of advanced liver disease include muscle wasting and weight loss as well as hepatomegaly, bruising, ascites, and edema. Ascites is best appreciated by attempts to detect shifting dullness by careful percussion. Ultrasound examination will confirm the finding of ascites in equivocal cases. Peripheral edema can occur with or without ascites. In patients with advanced liver disease, other factors frequently contribute to edema formation, including hypoalbuminemia, venous insufficiency, heart failure, and medications.

All women of reproductive age with acute pelvic pain should have a complete blood count with differential, ESR, urinalysis, and a sensitive qualitative urine or serum pregnancy test. If not diagnosed expeditiously, an acute process can often result in significant morbidity or mortality. For patients who have chronic pelvic pain and develop acute exacerbation, it is important to rule out a superimposed acute process. Symptoms of fever, chills, diaphoresis, abnormal vaginal bleeding, dizziness, syncope, emesis, significant diarrhea, obstipation, dysuria, hematuria, and hematochezia, and/or signs of elevated temperature, tachycardia, orthostasis, abdominal distention, abnormal bowel sounds, ascites, peritonitis, or abnormal pregnancy are all indicative of an acute process.

Laboratory tests for the evaluation of acute pelvic pain include a CBC with differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, clean catch midstream RUA, gonorrhea and chlamydia nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) from cervix or urine, and urine or serum pregnancy test. The sedimentation rate is nonspecific, but often is the only abnormal laboratory finding in women with subacute PID. If the pregnancy test is positive, a quantitative β-human chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG) should be ordered. Other studies that are recommended include transvaginal pelvic ultrasound, or if imaging is not available, culdocentesis. The ﬂuid from culdocentesis can be sent for hematocrit if bloody ﬂuid is obtained or Gram stain with culture if the ﬂuid is purulent. The presence of a mass in the cul-de-sac precludes culdocentesis. CT with and without contrast, abdominal x-rays, or upper or lower Gastrografin studies help rule out gastrointestinal pathology when gastrointestinal symptoms predominate. CT is useful for evaluation of retroperitoneal masses or abscesses related to the gastrointestinal tract. Pelvic MRI can be diagnostic if the pelvic ultrasound cannot determine whether a mass is uterine or adnexal.

Aseptic peritonitis is most commonly caused by the abnormal pres-1989 ence of physiologic fluids like gastric juice, bile, pancreatic enzymes, blood, or urine. It can also be caused by the effects of normally sterile foreign bodies like surgical sponges or instruments. More rarely, it occurs as a complication of systemic diseases like lupus erythematosus, porphyria, and familial Mediterranean fever. The chemical irritation caused by stomach acid and activated pancreatic enzymes is extreme and secondary bacterial infection may occur.

The cardinal signs and symptoms of peritonitis are acute, typically severe, abdominal pain with tenderness and fever. How the patient’s complaints of pain are manifested depends on their overall physical health and whether the inflammation is diffuse or localized. Elderly and immunosuppressed patients may not respond as aggressively to the irritation. Diffuse, generalized peritonitis is most often recognized as diffuse abdominal tenderness with local guarding, rigidity, and other evidence of parietal peritoneal irritation. Physical findings may only be identified in a specific region of the abdomen if the intraperitoneal inflammatory process is limited or otherwise contained as may occur in patients with uncomplicated appendicitis or diverticulitis. Bowel sounds are usually absent to hypoactive.

Most patients present with tachycardia and signs of volume depletion with hypotension. Laboratory testing typically reveals a significant leukocytosis, and patients may be severely acidotic. Radiographic studies may show dilatation of the bowel and associated bowel wall edema. Free air, or other evidence of leakage, requires attention and could represent a surgical emergency. In stable patients in whom ascites is present, diagnostic paracentesis is indicated, where the fluid is tested for protein and lactate dehydrogenase and the cell count is measured.

Whereas mortality rates can be less than 10% for reasonably healthy patients with relatively uncomplicated, localized peritonitis, mortality rates >40% have been reported for the elderly or immunocompromised. Successful treatment depends on correcting any electrolyte abnormalities, restoration of fluid volume and stabilization of the cardiovascular system, appropriate antibiotic therapy, and surgical correction of any underlying abnormalities.

Collapsed bowel distal to obstruction should increase the concern about the presence of complications such as ischemia, necrosis, or peritonitis. Severe pain with localization or signs of peritoneal irritation is suspicious for strangulated or closed-loop obstruction. It is important to remember that the discomfort may be out of proportion to physical findings mimicking the complaints of patients with acute mesenteric ischemia. Every patient should have a rectal examination. Patients with colonic volvulus present with the classic manifestations of closed-loop obstruction: severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and obstipation. Asymmetrical abdominal distension and a tympanic mass may be evident.

Patients with ileus or pseudo-obstruction may have signs and symptoms similar to those of bowel obstruction. Although abdominal distention is present, colicky abdominal pain is typically absent, and patients may not have nausea or emesis. Ongoing, regular discharge of stool or flatus can sometimes help distinguish patients with ileus from those with complete mechanical bowel obstruction.

Laboratory testing should include a complete blood count and serum electrolyte and creatinine measurements. Serial assessments are often useful. Mild hemoconcentration and slight elevation of the white blood cell count commonly occur after simple bowel obstruction. Emesis and dehydration may cause hypokalemia, hypochloremia, elevated blood urea nitrogen–to–creatinine ratios, and metabolic alkalosis. Patients may be hyponatremic on admission because many have attempted to rehydrate themselves with hypotonic fluids. The presence of guaiac-positive stools and iron-deficiency anemia are strongly suggestive of malignancy.

In addition to providing an initial assessment of the patient’s clinical stability, the physical examination of patients with chest discomfort can provide direct evidence of specific etiologies of chest pain (e.g., unilateral absence of lung sounds) and can identify potential precipitants of acute cardiopulmonary causes of chest pain (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension), relevant comorbid conditions (e.g., obstructive pulmonary disease), and complications of the presenting syndrome (e.g., heart failure). However, because the findings on physical examination may be normal in patients with unstable ischemic heart disease, an unremarkable physical exam is not definitively reassuring.

general The patient’s general appearance is helpful in establishing an initial impression of the severity of illness. Patients with acute MI or other acute cardiopulmonary disorders often appear anxious, uncomfortable, pale, cyanotic, or diaphoretic. Patients who are massaging or clutching their chests may describe their pain with a clenched fist held against the sternum (Levine’s sign). Occasionally, body habitus is helpful—e.g., in patients with Marfan syndrome or the prototypical young, tall, thin man with spontaneous pneumothorax.

PART 2 Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases

Vital Signs Significant tachycardia and hypotension are indicative of important hemodynamic consequences of the underlying cause of chest discomfort and should prompt a rapid survey for the most severe conditions, such as acute MI with cardiogenic shock, massive pulmonary embolism, pericarditis with tamponade, or tension pneumothorax. Acute aortic emergencies usually present with severe hypertension but may be associated with profound hypotension when there is coronary arterial compromise or dissection into the pericardium. Sinus tachycardia is an important manifestation of submassive pulmonary embolism. Tachypnea and hypoxemia point toward a pulmonary cause. The presence of low-grade fever is nonspecific because it may occur with MI and with thromboembolism in addition to infection.

Hx/PE: Presents with crepitus and abnormal chest wall movement. Abnormal chest wall movement may not be appreciated if the patient is splinting because of pain.

Dx: Primarily clinical, although CXR, O2 saturation, and blood gases may help.

Tx: O2, narcotic analgesia. Respiratory support, including intubation and mechanical ventilation, may be needed to treat hypoxemia in severe cases. Surgical fixation of the chest wall is generally needed.

Cx: Respiratory compromise is a complication due to underlying pulmonary contusion.

The spleen and liver are the most commonly injured organs following blunt abdominal trauma. Symptoms are consistent with signs of blood loss and include hypotension, tachycardia, and peritonitis. Suspect spleen or liver injury when lower rib fractures are present.

Pancreatic rupture should be suspected after a direct epigastric blow (handlebar injury).

History and Physical Examination The chest discomfort, often severe enough to be described as frank pain, is typically located in the sub-sternal region or sometimes in the epigastrium, and radiates to the left arm, left shoulder, and/or neck. Anginal “equivalents” such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension.

Electrocardiogram ST-segment depression occurs in 20 to 25% of patients; it may be transient in patients without biomarker evidence of myocardial necrosis, but may be persistent for several days in NSTEMI. T-wave changes are common but are less specific signs of ischemia, unless they are new and deep T-wave inversions (≥0.3 mV).

document (3) 

Patients with IHD also can present with cardiomegaly and heart failure secondary to ischemic damage of the left ventricular myocardium that may have caused no symptoms before the development of heart failure; this condition is referred to as ischemic cardiomyopathy. In contrast to the asymptomatic phase of IHD, the symptomatic phase is characterized by chest discomfort due to either angina pectoris or acute myocardial infarction (Chap. 295). Having entered the symptomatic phase, the patient may exhibit a stable or progressive course, revert to the asymptomatic stage, or die suddenly.

This episodic clinical syndrome is due to transient myocardial ischemia. Various diseases that cause myocardial ischemia and the numerous forms of discomfort with which it may be confused are discussed in Chap. 19. Males constitute ~70% of all patients with angina pectoris and an even greater proportion of those less than 50 years of age. It is, however, important to note that angina pectoris in women is often atypical in presentation (see below).

The typical patient with angina is a man >50 years or a woman >60 years of age who complains of episodes of chest discomfort, usually described as heaviness, pressure, squeezing, smothering, or choking and only rarely as frank pain. When the patient is asked to localize the sensation, he or she typically places a hand over the sternum, sometimes with a clenched fist, to indicate a squeezing, central, substernal discomfort (Levine’s sign). Angina is usually crescendo-decrescendo in nature, typically lasts 2 to 5 min, and can radiate to either shoulder and to both arms (especially the ulnar surfaces of the forearm and hand). It also can arise in or radiate to the back, interscapular region, root of the neck, jaw, teeth, and epigastrium. Angina is rarely localized below the umbilicus or above the mandible. A useful finding in assessing a patient with chest discomfort is the fact that myocardial ischemic discomfort does not radiate to the trapezius muscles; that radiation pattern is more typical of pericarditis.

Cirrhosis accounts for 84% of cases of ascites. Cardiac ascites, peritoneal carcinomatosis, and “mixed” ascites resulting from cirrhosis and a second disease account for 10–15% of cases. Less common causes of ascites include massive hepatic metastasis, infection (tuberculosis, Chlamydia infection), pancreatitis, and renal disease (nephrotic syndrome). Rare causes of ascites include hypothyroidism and familial Mediterranean fever.

Once the presence of ascites has been confirmed, the etiology of the ascites is best determined by paracentesis, a bedside procedure in which a needle or small catheter is passed transcutaneously to extract ascitic fluid from the peritoneum. The lower quadrants are the most frequent sites for paracentesis. The left lower quadrant is preferred because of the greater depth of ascites and the thinner abdominal wall.

Paracentesis is a safe procedure even in patients with coagulopathy; 287 complications, including abdominal wall hematomas, hypotension, hepatorenal syndrome, and infection, are infrequent.

Once ascitic fluid has been extracted, its gross appearance should be examined. Turbid fluid can result from the presence of infection or tumor cells. White, milky fluid indicates a triglyceride level >200 mg/ dL (and often >1000 mg/dL), which is the hallmark of chylous ascites. Chylous ascites results from lymphatic disruption that may occur with trauma, cirrhosis, tumor, tuberculosis, or certain congenital abnormalities. Dark brown fluid can reflect a high bilirubin concentration and indicates biliary tract perforation. Black fluid may indicate the presence of pancreatic necrosis or metastatic melanoma.

The ascitic fluid should be sent for measurement of albumin and total protein levels, cell and differential counts, and, if infection is suspected, Gram’s stain and culture, with inoculation into blood culture bottles at the patient’s bedside to maximize the yield. A serum albumin level should be measured simultaneously to permit calculation of the serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG).

Hepatorenal syndrome: A diagnosis of exclusion; difficult to treat and often requires dialysis.

Hepatic encephalopathy:

Due to ↓ clearance of ammonia.

Often precipitated by dehydration, infection, electrolyte abnormalities, and GI bleeding.

Treat with dietary protein restriction, lactulose, and rifaximin.

Esophageal varices:

Monitor for GI bleeding; treat medically (β-blockers, octreotide), endoscopically (band ligation), or surgically (portocaval shunt).

Consider liver transplantation for patients with advanced disease.

An autoimmune disorder characterized by destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts. The disease most commonly presents in middle-aged women with other autoimmune conditions.

Hx/PE: Presents with progressive jaundice, pruritus, and malabsorption of the fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K).

Patients may present with abdominal pain or symptoms of DM, hypogonadism, arthropathy of the MCP joints, heart failure, or cirrhosis.

Exam may reveal bronze skin pigmentation, pancreatic dysfunction, cardiac dysfunction (CHF), hepatomegaly, and testicular atrophy.

■↑ serum iron, percent saturation of iron, and ferritin with ↓ serum transferrin.

Fasting transferrin saturation (serum iron divided by transferrin level) > 45% is the most sensitive diagnostic test.

Glucose intolerance and mildly elevated AST and alkaline phosphatase can be present.

Perform a liver biopsy (to determine hepatic iron index), hepatic MRI, or HFE gene mutation screen.

Weekly phlebotomy; when serum iron levels ↓, perform maintenance phlebotomy every 2–4 months.

Deferoxamine can be used for maintenance therapy.

Cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, cardiomegaly leading to CHF and/or conduction defects, DM, impotence, arthropathy, hypopituitarism.

■↓ ceruloplasmin and excessive deposition of copper in the liver and brain due to a deficient copper-transporting protein. Linked to an autosomalrecessive defect on chromosome 13. Usually occurs in patients < 30 years of age; 50% of patients are symptomatic by age 15.

Hx: Patients with present hemolytic anemia, liver abnormalities (jaundice 2° to hepatitis/cirrhosis), and neurologic (loss of coordination, tremor, dysphagia) as well as psychiatric (psychosis, anxiety, mania, depression) abnormalities.

PE: May reveal Kayser-Fleischer rings in the cornea (green-to-brown deposits of copper in Descemet’s membrane) as well as jaundice, hepatomegaly, asterixis, choreiform movements, and rigidity.

Dx: ↓ serum ceruloplasmin, ↑ urinary copper excretion, ↑ hepatic copper.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT:

The history is important in evaluating putative predisposing factors, including a history of hepatitis or jaundice, blood transfusion, or use of intravenous drugs. A family history of HCC or hepatitis should be sought and a detailed social history taken to include job descriptions for industrial exposure to possible carcinogenic drugs as well as contraceptive hormones. Physical examination should include assessing stigmata of underlying liver disease such as jaundice, ascites, peripheral edema, spider nevi, palmar erythema, and weight loss. Evaluation of the abdomen for hepatic size, masses or ascites, hepatic nodularity and tenderness, and splenomegaly is needed, as is assessment of overall performance status and psychosocial evaluation.

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185–190 lb.

6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient.

Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese.

6.2. Which one of the following statements best describes the patient?

A. She has approximately the same number of adipocytes as an individual of normal weight, but each adipocyte is larger.

B. She shows an apple pattern of fat distribution.

C. She would be expected to show higher-than-normal levels of adiponectin.

D. She would be expected to show lower-than-normal levels of circulating leptin.

E. She would be expected to show lower-than-normal levels of circulating triacylglycerols.

Acute infections are most often subclinical and anicteric.

When they are clinically apparent, nausea and vomiting, headache, and malaise may precede jaundice by 1 to 2 weeks. Lowgrade fever is more common with hepatitis A. By the time jaundice develops, symptoms are usually improving. Serum transaminase levels vary, and their peaks do not correspond with disease severity (see Table 55-1). Peak levels that range from 400 to 4000 U/L are usually reached by the time jaundice develops. Serum bilirubin values typically continue to rise, despite falling serum transaminase levels, and peak at 5 to 20 mgl dL.

Any evidence for severe disease should prompt hospitalization. These include persistent nausea and vomiting, prolonged prothrombin time, low serum albumin level, hypoglycemia, high serum bilirubin level, or central nervous system symptoms. In most cases, however, clinical and biochemical recovery is complete within 1 to 2 months in all cases of hepatitis A, in most cases of hepatitis B, but in only a small proportion of cases of hepatitis C.

When patients are hospitalized, their feces, secretions, bedpans, and other articles in contact with the intestinal tract should be handled with glove-protected hands. Extra precautions, such as double gloving during delivery and surgical procedures, are recommended. Due to significant exposure of health-care personnel to hepatitis B, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2016a) recommend active and passive vaccination, described later. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C, so recommendations are for postexposure serosurveillance only.

Acute hepatitis has a case-fatality rate of 0.1 percent. For patients ill enough to be hospitalized, it may reach 1 percent. Most fatalities are due to fulminant hepatic necrosis, which in later pregnancy may resemble acute fatty liver. In these cases, hepatic encephalopathy is the usual presentation, and the mortality rate is 80 percent. Approximately half of patients with fulminant disease have hepatitis B infection, and co-infection with the delta agent is common.

The stage of chronic hepatitis, which reflects the level of progression of the disease, is based on the degree of hepatic fibrosis. When fibrosis is so extensive that fibrous septa surround parenchymal nodules and alter the normal architecture of the liver lobule, the histologic lesion is defined as cirrhosis. Staging is based on the degree of fibrosis as categorized on a numerical scale from 0−6 (HAI) or 0−4 (METAVIR) (Table 362-2). Several noninvasive approaches have been introduced to provide approximations of hepatic histologic stage, including serum biomarkers of fibrosis and imaging determinations of liver elasticity.

Both the enterically transmitted forms of viral hepatitis, hepatitis A and E, are self-limited and do not cause chronic hepatitis (rare reports notwithstanding in which acute hepatitis A serves as a trigger for the onset of autoimmune hepatitis in genetically susceptible patients or in which hepatitis E (Chap. 360) can cause chronic liver disease in immunosuppressed hosts, e.g., after liver transplantation). In contrast, the entire clinicopathologic spectrum of chronic hepatitis occurs in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B and C as well as in patients with chronic hepatitis D superimposed on chronic hepatitis B.

The likelihood of chronicity after acute hepatitis B varies as a function of age. Infection at birth is associated with clinically silent acute infection but a 90% chance of chronic infection, whereas infection in young adulthood in immunocompetent persons is typically associated with clinically apparent acute hepatitis but a risk of chronicity of only approximately 1%. Most cases of chronic hepatitis B among adults, however, occur in patients who never had a recognized episode of clinically apparent acute viral hepatitis. The degree of liver injury (grade) in patients with chronic hepatitis B is variable, ranging from none in inactive carriers to mild to moderate to severe. Among adults

HEV is an enterically transmitted, water-borne infection that usually produces a self-limiting disease. The virus typically infects young to middle-aged adults. HEV is a zoonotic disease with animal reservoirs that include monkeys, cats, pigs, and dogs. Epidemics have been reported in Asia and the Indian subcontinent, sub-Saharan Africa, and Mexico, and sporadic cases are seen in Western nations, particularly where pig farming is common and in travelers returning from regions of high incidence. Of greater importance, HEV infection accounts for 30% to 60% of cases of sporadic acute hepatitis in India, exceeding the frequency of HAV. A characteristic feature of HEV infection is the high mortality rate among pregnant women, approaching 20%. In most cases, HEV is not associated with chronic liver disease or persistent viremia. The average incubation period following exposure is 4 to 5 weeks.

http://ebooksmedicine.net

Discovered in 1983, HEV is an unenveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus in the Hepevirus genus. Virions are shed in stool during the acute illness. Before the onset of clinical illness, HEV RNA and HEV virions can be detected by PCR in stool and serum. The onset of rising serum aminotransferases, clinical illness, and elevated IgM anti-HEV titers are virtually simultaneous. Symptoms resolve in 2 to 4 weeks, during which time the IgM titers fall and IgG anti-HEV titers rise.

he hepatitis B virus is transmitted by exposure to blood or body fluids from infected individuals. In endemic countries, vertical transmission, that is, from mother to fetus or newborn, accounts for at least 35 to 50 percent of chronic HBV infections. In low-prevalence countries such as the United States, which has a prevalence <2 percent, the more frequent mode of HBV transmission is by sexual transmission or by sharing contaminated needles. HBV can be transmitted in any body luid, but exposure to virus-laden serum is the most eicient.

Acute hepatitis B develops after an incubation period of 30 to 180 days with a mean of 8 to 12 weeks. At least half of acute infections are asymptomatic. If symptoms are present, they are usually mild and include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice. Acute HBV accounts for half of cases of fulminant hepatitis. Symptoms completely resolve within 3 to.4 months in more than 90 percent of patients.

Figure 55-2 details the sequence of the various HBV antigens and antibodies in acute infection. The first serological marker to be detected is the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) , often preceding the increase in transaminase levels. As HBsAg disappears, antibodies to the surface antigen develop (anti-HBs), marking complete resolution of disease. Hepatitis B core antigen is an intracellular antigen and not detectable in serum. However, anti -HBc is detectable wi thin weeks of HBsAg appearance. The hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) is present during times of high viral replication and often correlates with detectable HBV DNA. After acute hepatitis, approximately 90 percent of adults recover completely. The 10 percent who remain chronically infected are considered to have chronic hepatitis B.

Chronic HBV infection is oten asymptomatic but may be clinically suggested by persistent anorexia, weight loss, fatigue, and

As already mentioned, the deaf child makes the transition from crying to cooing and babbling at the usual age of 3 to 5 months. After the sixth month, however, the child becomes much quieter, and the usual repertoire of babbling sounds becomes stereotyped and unchanging, though still uttered with pleasant voice. A more conspicuous failure comes somewhat later, when babbling fails to give way to word formation. Should deafness develop within the first few years of life, the child gradually loses such speech as had been acquired but can be retaught by the lipreading method. Speech, however, is harsh, poorly modulated, and unpleasant, and accompanied by many peculiar squeals and snorting or grunting noises. Social and other acquisitions appear at the expected times in the congenitally deaf child, unlike in the developmentally delayed child. The deaf child seems eager to communicate and makes known all his needs by gesture or pantomime, often very cleverly. The deaf child may attract attention by vivid facial expressions, motions of the lips, nodding, or head shaking. The Leiter performance scale, which makes no use of sounds, will show that intelligence is normal. Deafness can be demonstrated at an early age by careful observation of the child’s responses to sounds and by free-field audiometry, but the full range of hearing cannot be accurately tested before the age of 3 or 4 years. Recording of brainstem auditory evoked potentials and testing of the labyrinths, which are frequently unresponsive in deaf mutes, may be helpful. Early diagnosis is important so as to fit the child with a hearing aid and to begin appropriate language training.

In contrast to the child in whom deafness is the only abnormality, the developmentally delayed child generally talks little but may display a rich personality. Autistic children may also be mute; if they speak, echolalia is prominent and the personal “I” is avoided. Blind children of normal intelligence tend to speak slowly and fail to acquire imitative gestures.

document (1) 

The first group, comprising otherwise normal children who talk late, is the more puzzling. It is virtually impossible to predict whether such a child’s speech will eventually be normal in all respects and just when this will occur. Prelanguage speech continues into the period when words and phrases should normally be used in propositional speech. The combinations of sounds are close to the standard of normal vowel–consonant combinations of the 1to 2-year-old, and they may be strung together as if forming sentences. Yet, as time passes, the child may utter only a few understandable words, even by the third or fourth year. Three of 4 such patients will be boys and often one discovers a family history of delayed speech. When the child finally begins to talk, he may skip the early stages of spoken language and progress rapidly to speak in full sentences and to develop fluent speech and language in weeks or months. During the period of speech delay, the understanding of words and general intelligence develop normally, and communication by gestures may be remarkably facile. In such children, motor speech delay does not presage mental backwardness. (It is said that Albert Einstein did not speak until the age of 4 and lacked fluency at age 9.)

Nevertheless, the eventual acquisition of fluent speech is no guarantee of normalcy (Rutter and Martin). Many such children do have later educational difficulties, mainly because of dyslexia and dysgraphia, a combination that is sometimes inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, again more frequently in boys (see further on). In a smaller subgroup, articulation remains infantile and the content of speech is impoverished semantically and syntactically. Yet others, as they begin to speak, express themselves fluently, but with distortions, omissions, and cluttering of words, but such patients usually acquire normal speech patterns with development.

document (2) 

Learning to produce speech sounds clearly and accurately and learning to produce con- nected speech fluently are developmental skills. Articulation of speech sounds follows a developmental pattern, which is reﬂected in the age norms of standardized tests. It is not unusual for typically developing children to use developmental processes for shortening words and syllables as they are learning to talk, but their progression in mastering speech sound production should result in mostly intelligible speech by age 3 years. Children with speech sound disorder continue to use immature phonological simplification processes past the age when most children can produce words clearly.

accurately according to age and community norms by age 7 years. The most frequently mis- articulated sounds also tend to be learned later, leading them to be called the ”late eight" (I, r, s, 2, th, ch, dzh, and zh). Misarticulation of any of these sounds by itself could be considered within normal limits up to age 8 years. When multiple sounds are involved, it may be appro- priate to target some of those sounds as part of a plan to improve intelligibility prior to the age at which almost all children can produce them accurately. Lisping (i.e., misarticulating sibi- lants) is particularly common and may involve frontal or lateral patterns of airstream direc- tion. It may be associated with an abnormal tongue—thrust swallowing pattern.

Most children with speech sound disorder respond well to treatment, and speech dif- ficulties improve over time, and thus the disorder may not be lifelong. However, when a language disorder is also present, the speech disorder has a poorer prognosis and may be associated with specific learning disorders.

Normal variations in speech. Regional, social, or cultural/ethnic variations of speech should be considered before making the diagnosis.

Hearing or other sensory impairment. Hearing impairment or deafness may result in abnormalities of speech. Deficits of speech sound production may be associated with a hearing impairment, other sensory deficit, or a speech-motor deficit. When speech deficits are in excess of those usually associated with these problems, a diagnosis of speech sound disorder may be made.

Structu ral deficits. Speech impairment may be due to structural deficits (e.g., cleft palate).

document (3) 

Developmental disorders of speech and language are far more frequent than acquired disorders, for example, aphasia. The former include developmental speech delay, congenital deafness with speech delay, developmental word deafness, dyslexia (special reading disability), cluttered speech, infantilisms of speech, and stuttering or stammering, and mechanical disorders such as cleft-palate speech. Often in these disorders, the various stages of language development described earlier are not attained at the usual age and may not be achieved even by adulthood. Disorders of this type, especially those restricted to the language areas of the cerebrum, are far more frequently a result of slowness in the normal processes of maturation than to an acquired disease. With the possible exception of developmental dyslexia (see further on), cerebral lesions have not been described in these cases, although it must be emphasized that only a small number of brains of such individuals have been thoroughly studied.

In discussing the developmental disorders of speech and language, we have adopted a conventional classification. Not usually included in such a classification are the many mundane peculiarities of speech and language that are usually accepted without comment: lack of fluency, inability to speak uninterruptedly in complete sentences, and lack of proper intonation, inflection, and melody of speech (dysprosody).

Fully two-thirds of children say their first words between 9 and 12 months of age and their first word combinations before their second birthday; when this does not happen, it becomes a matter of parental concern. Children who fail to reach these milestones at the stated times fall into two general categories. In one group there is no clear evidence of cognitive delay or impairment of neurologic or auditory function. In a second group, the speech delay has an overt pathologic basis.

All women of reproductive age with acute pelvic pain should have a complete blood count with differential, ESR, urinalysis, and a sensitive qualitative urine or serum pregnancy test. If not diagnosed expeditiously, an acute process can often result in significant morbidity or mortality. For patients who have chronic pelvic pain and develop acute exacerbation, it is important to rule out a superimposed acute process. Symptoms of fever, chills, diaphoresis, abnormal vaginal bleeding, dizziness, syncope, emesis, significant diarrhea, obstipation, dysuria, hematuria, and hematochezia, and/or signs of elevated temperature, tachycardia, orthostasis, abdominal distention, abnormal bowel sounds, ascites, peritonitis, or abnormal pregnancy are all indicative of an acute process.

Laboratory tests for the evaluation of acute pelvic pain include a CBC with differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, clean catch midstream RUA, gonorrhea and chlamydia nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) from cervix or urine, and urine or serum pregnancy test. The sedimentation rate is nonspecific, but often is the only abnormal laboratory finding in women with subacute PID. If the pregnancy test is positive, a quantitative β-human chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG) should be ordered. Other studies that are recommended include transvaginal pelvic ultrasound, or if imaging is not available, culdocentesis. The ﬂuid from culdocentesis can be sent for hematocrit if bloody ﬂuid is obtained or Gram stain with culture if the ﬂuid is purulent. The presence of a mass in the cul-de-sac precludes culdocentesis. CT with and without contrast, abdominal x-rays, or upper or lower Gastrografin studies help rule out gastrointestinal pathology when gastrointestinal symptoms predominate. CT is useful for evaluation of retroperitoneal masses or abscesses related to the gastrointestinal tract. Pelvic MRI can be diagnostic if the pelvic ultrasound cannot determine whether a mass is uterine or adnexal.

Chronic ectopic pregnancy is a condition in which the pregnancy does not completely resorb during expectant management. The condition arises when there is persistence of the chorionic villi with bleeding into the tubal wall, which is distended slowly and does not rupture. It may arise from chronic bleeding from the fimbriated end of the fallopian tube with subsequent tamponade. In a series of 50 patients with a chronic ectopic pregnancy, pain was present in 86%, vaginal bleeding was present in 68%, and both symptoms were present in 58% (234). Ninety percent of the patients had amenorrhea ranging from 5 to 16 weeks (mean, 9.6 weeks). Most patients develop a pelvic mass that usually is symptomatic. The β-hCG level usually is low but may be absent; ultrasonography may be helpful in the diagnosis; rarely, bowel involvement or ureteral compression or obstruction exists (234,235).

This condition is treated surgically with removal of the affected tube. Often, the ovary must be removed because there is inﬂammation with subsequent adhesion development. A hematoma may be present secondary to chronic bleeding.

Cervical Pregnancy The incidence of cervical pregnancy in the United States ranges from

Pregnancy 1 in 2,400 to 1 in 50,000 pregnancies and accounts for less than 1% of ectopic pregnancies (236,237). The cause of cervical ectopic pregnancies is unknown and the rare occurrence prevents identification of known risk factors. The incidence does appear to be higher with in vitro fertilization procedures, accounting for 3.7% of IVF-related ectopic pregnancies (238).

The clinical criteria for diagnosing a cervical pregnancy include the following findings (239): 1.

Uterus is smaller than the surrounding distended cervix; 2.

3.

4.

Profuse bleeding on manipulation of cervix.

Patients classically present with painless vaginal bleeding, but reports of associated cramping and pain are published (240).

Assess the extent of bleeding:

Menorrhagia: ↑ amount of fow (> 80 mL of blood loss per cycle) or prolonged bleeding (fow lasting > 8 days); may lead to anemia.

Oligomenorrhea: An ↑ length of time between menses (35–90 days between cycles).

Polymenorrhea: Frequent menstruation (< 21-day cycle); anovular.

Metrorrhagia: Bleeding between periods.

Menometrorrhagia: Excessive and irregular bleeding.

Pelvic exam: Look for an enlarged uterus, a cervical mass, or polyps to assess for myomas, pregnancy, or cervical cancer.

First step: Obtain a β-hCG to rule out ectopic pregnancy.

Second step: Order a CBC to rule out anemia.

Third step:

Pap smear to rule out cervical cancer (which can present with bleeding).

TFTs to rule out hyper-/hypothyroidism and hyperprolactinemia.

Obtain platelet count, bleeding time, and PT/PTT to rule out von Willebrand’s disease and factor XI def ciency.

Order an ultrasound to evaluate the ovaries, uterus, and endometrium. Look for uterine masses, polycystic ovaries, and thickness of the endometrium.

If the endometrium is ≥ 4 mm in a postmenopausal woman, obtain an endometrial biopsy. An endometrial biopsy should also be obtained if the patient is > 35 years of age, obese (BMI > 35), and diabetic.

Heavy bleeding: Since heavy or prolonged uterine bleeding has likely denuded the endometrial cavity, estrogen is needed to rapidly promote endometrial growth.

First step: For hemorrhage, high-dose estrogen IV stabilizes the endometrial lining and stops bleeding within one hour.

Next step: If bleeding is not controlled within 12–24 hours, a D&C is indicated.

The classic symptom triad of ectopic pregnancy is pain, amenorrhea, and vaginal bleeding. This symptom group is present in about 50% of patients and is typical in patients with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Abdominal pain is the most common presenting symptom, but the severity and nature of the pain vary widely. There is no pathognomonic pain that is diagnostic of ectopic pregnancy. Pain may be unilateral or bilateral and may occur in the upper or lower abdomen. The pain may be dull, sharp, or crampy and either continuous or intermittent. With rupture, the patient may experience transient relief of the pain, as stretching of the tubal serosa ceases. Shoulder and back pain, thought to result from hemoperitoneal irritation of the diaphragm, may indicate intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

Physical Examination The physical examination should include measurements of vital signs and examination of the abdomen and pelvis. Frequently, the findings before rupture and hemorrhage are nonspecific, and vital signs are normal. The abdomen may be nontender or mildly tender, with or without rebound. The uterus may be slightly enlarged, with findings similar to a normal pregnancy (103,104). Cervical motion tenderness may or may not be present. An adnexal mass may be palpable in up to 50% of cases, but the mass varies markedly in size, consistency, and tenderness. A palpable mass may be the corpus luteum and not the ectopic pregnancy. With rupture and intra-abdominal hemorrhage, the patient develops tachycardia followed by hypotension. Bowel sounds are decreased or absent. The abdomen is distended, with marked tenderness and rebound tenderness. Cervical motion tenderness is present. Frequently, the findings of the pelvic examination are inadequate because of pain and guarding.

History and physical examination may or may not provide useful diagnostic information. The accuracy of the initial clinical evaluation is less than 50% (105). Additional tests are frequently required to differentiate early viable intrauterine pregnancy or suspected ectopic or abnormal intrauterine pregnancy.

IBS is a disorder that affects all ages, although most patients have their first symptoms before age 45. Older individuals have a lower reporting frequency. Women are diagnosed with IBS two to three times as often as men and make up 80% of the population with severe IBS. As indicated in Table 352-1, pain or abdominal discomfort is a key symptom for the diagnosis of IBS. These symptoms should be improved with defecation and/or have their onset associated with a change in frequency or form of stool. Painless diarrhea or constipation does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria to be classified as IBS. Supportive symptoms that are not part of the diagnostic criteria include defecation straining, urgency or a feeling of incomplete bowel movement, passing mucus, and bloating.

Abdominal Pain According to the current IBS diagnostic criteria, abdominal pain or discomfort is a prerequisite clinical feature of IBS. Abdominal pain in IBS is highly variable in intensity and location. It is frequently episodic and crampy, but it may be superimposed on a background of constant ache. Pain may be mild enough to be ignored or it may interfere with daily activities. Despite this, malnutrition due to inadequate caloric intake is exceedingly rare with IBS. Sleep deprivation is also unusual because abdominal pain is almost uniformly present only during waking hours. However, patients with severe IBS frequently wake repeatedly during the night; thus, nocturnal pain is a poor discriminating factor between organic and functional bowel disease. Pain is often exacerbated by eating or emotional stress and improved by passage of flatus or stools. In addition, female patients with IBS commonly report worsening symptoms during the premenstrual and menstrual phases.

anomaly because the large RV causes left ventricular compres-sion (Fig. 20-44A,B).Diagnosis. There is a spectrum of clinical presentation in infants with Ebstein’s anomaly that mirrors the anatomic spec-trum of this anomaly. Some infants with less severe forms may present with a mild degree of cyanosis, whereas the onset of clinical symptoms in patients surviving childhood is gradual, with the average age of diagnosis in the mid-teens.However, the infant with severe atrialization and pulmo-nary stenosis will be both cyanotic and acidotic at birth.

infants initially have higher pulmonary flow due to the decreased downstream resistance. This causes left atrial enlargement and a left-to-right shunt via the patent foramen ovale.Postnatally, the LV does not hypertrophy because it is not subjected to systemic afterload. The lack of normal extrauter-ine left ventricular maturation has important implications for the timing of surgical repair because the LV must be converted to the systemic ventricle and be able to function against sys-temic vascular resistance. If complete repair is done within the first few weeks of life, the LV usually adapts easily to systemic resistance

document (2) 

After birth, left atrial pressure is raised above that in the inferior vena cava and right atrium by (1) the decrease in pulmonary resistance, with the consequent large flow of blood through the lungs to the left atrium; (2) the reduction of flow to the right atrium caused by occlusion of the umbilical vein; and (3) the increased resistance to left ventricular output produced by occlusion of the umbilical arteries. Reversal of the pressure gradient across the atria abruptly closes the valve over the foramen ovale, and the septal leaflets fuse over a period of several days.

The decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance causes the pressure in the pulmonary artery to fall to approximately half its previous level (to ≈35 mm Hg). This change in pressure, coupled with a slight increase in aortic pressure, reverses the flow of blood through the ductus arteriosus. However, within several minutes, the large ductus arteriosus begins to constrict. This constriction produces turbulent flow, which is manifested as a murmur in newborn infants. Constriction of the ductus arteriosus is progressive and usually complete within 1 to 2 days after birth. Closure of the ductus arteriosus appears to be initiated by the high PO2 of the arterial blood passing through it; pulmonary ventilation with O2 closes the ductus, whereas ventilation with air low in O2 opens this shunt vessel. Whether O2 acts directly on the ductus or through the release of a vasoconstrictor substance is not known.

the peripheral pulmonary arteries. Most children, however, present with mild cyanosis at birth, which then pro-gresses as the right ventricular hypertrophy further compromises the RVOT. Cyanosis usually becomes significant within the first 6 to 12 months of life, and the child may develop characteristic “tet” spells, which are periods of extreme hypoxemia. These spells are characterized by decreased pulmonary blood flow and an increase in systemic blood flow. They can be triggered by any stimulus that decreases systemic vascular resistance, such as fever, agitation, or vigorous physical activity. Cyanotic spells increase in severity and frequency as

This is particularly true for penetrating injuries of the neck, thoracic outlet, and groin, where bleeding may be torrential and aris-ing deep within the wound. In these situations, a gloved finger placed through the wound directly onto the bleeding vessel can apply enough pressure to control active bleeding. The surgeon performing this maneuver must then walk with the patient to the OR for definitive treatment.

If open pneumothorax is identified, an occlusive dressing must be applied immediately. This must be secured on three sides only to prevent the development of tension pneumothorax.

Massive hemothorax is diagnosed through chest tube placement and is defined as > 1000 cc of immediate blood return or > 200/hour for > 2–4 hours. The treatment for massive hemothorax is volume resuscitation followed by surgery to repair the site of bleeding. The treatment for ﬂail chest is supportive, followed by surgical fixation of the chest wall.

Circulation:

Apply direct pressure to any actively bleeding wounds.

Place a 16-gauge IV in each antecubital fossa.

Isotonic ﬂuids (LR or NS) are repleted in a 3:1 ratio (ﬂuid to blood loss). Start with a ﬂuid bolus of 1–2 L in adults; then recheck vitals and continue repletion as indicated.

If the patient remains tachycardic or hypotensive after the first 2 L of isotonic ﬂuid, transfusion with packed RBCs may be indicated.

To remember the Glasgow Coma Scale, think 4-eyes, Jackson-5, V6 engine. Four points can be assigned for eye response, five points for verbal response, and six points for motor response.

Patients with chest trauma and shock may have cardiac tamponade. The relevant signs are JVD, hypotension, and mufﬂed heart sounds. This can be diagnosed with bedside ultrasound. If tamponade is diagnosed, an immediate pericardiocentesis is necessary.

Disability/Exposure:

Disability (CNS dysfunction) is assessed and quantified with the GCS.

Exposure requires that the patient be completely disrobed and assessed for injury and temperature status on both the front and back of the body. Hypothermia is a common problem in trauma and can worsen bleeding; once the exam is done, the patient should be covered with warm blankets.

Once the patient is stable, conduct a full examination.

Sharp, fleeting chest pain or a prolonged, dull ache localized to the 1581 left submammary area is rarely due to myocardial ischemia. However, especially in women and diabetic patients, angina pectoris may be atypical in location and not strictly related to provoking factors. In addition, this symptom may exacerbate and remit over days, weeks, or months. Its occurrence can be seasonal, occurring more frequently in the winter in temperate climates. Anginal “equivalents” are symptoms of myocardial ischemia other than angina. They include dyspnea, nausea, fatigue, and faintness and are more common in the elderly and in diabetic patients.

Systematic questioning of a patient with suspected IHD is important to uncover the features of an unstable syndrome associated with increased risk, such as angina occurring with less exertion than in the past, occurring at rest, or awakening the patient from sleep. Since coronary atherosclerosis often is accompanied by similar lesions in other arteries, a patient with angina should be questioned and examined for peripheral arterial disease (intermittent claudication [Chap. 302]), stroke, or transient ischemic attacks (Chap. 446). It is also important to uncover a family history of premature IHD (<55 years in first-degree male relatives and <65 in female relatives) and the presence of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, cigarette smoking, and other risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis (Chap. 291e).

Signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary depending on the infecting organism and the patient’s immune status. In typical pneumonias, the usual presentation is a patient with high fever, rigors, productive cough, chills, and pleuritic chest pain. Chest radiography often will show infiltrates (11). The following agents, listed in decreasing order, cause two-thirds of all bacterial pneumonias: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus inﬂuenza, Klebsiella pneumoniae, gram-negative organisms, and anaerobic bacteria. Atypical pneumonias are more insidious in onset than typical pneumonias. Patients have moderate fever without the characteristic rigors and chills. Additional symptoms include a nonproductive cough, headache, myalgias, and mild leukocytosis. Chest radiography reveals bronchopneumonia with a diffuse interstitial pattern; characteristically, the patient does not appear to be as ill as the x-ray suggests. Common causes of atypical pneumonia include viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia pneumoniae (also called the TWAR agent), and other rare agents.

A strong index of suspicion is required for diagnosis, especially in elderly and immunocompromised individuals, who have altered response mechanisms. This is true with “typical agents.” Subtle clues in the elderly include changes in mentation, confusion, and exacerbation of other illnesses. The febrile response may be entirely absent, and the results of the physical examination are not predictive of pneumonia. In high-risk groups, an increased respiratory rate of greater than 25 breaths per minute remains the most reliable sign of infection. Mortality in these high-risk groups of patients is strongly correlated with the ability of the host to mount normal defenses to the symptoms of fever, chills, and tachycardia.

All women suspected of having pneumonia should undergo chest radiography to establish the diagnosis and to detect alternate diagnoses such as congestive heart failure and tumors.

but may occur with other cardiac pathologies that result in ischemia from a mismatch between the supply of oxygen by the coronary circulation and the metabolic demand of the myo-cardium. Typically, angina is described as tightness, heaviness, or dull pain, frequently substernal, that lasts for a few minutes. This discomfort may radiate to the left arm, neck, mandible, or epigastrium. Angina is most often provoked by activities that increase metabolic demand on the heart such as exercise, eating, and states of intense emotion, and it is typically alleviated by rest or use of nitroglycerin.

Blood consists of cells and their derivatives and a protein-rich fluid called plasma.

Blood cells and their derivatives include:  erythrocytes, also called red blood cells (RBCs), leukocytes, also known as white blood cells (WBCs), and thrombocytes, also termed platelets.

Plasma is the liquid extracellular material that imparts fluid properties to blood. The relative volume of cells and plasma in whole blood is approximately 45% and 55%,  respectively. The

volume of packed erythrocytes in a sample of blood is called the hematocrit. The hematocrit is measured by centrifuging a blood sample to which anticoagulants have been added, and then calculating the percentage of the centrifuge tube volume occupied by the erythrocytes compared with that of the whole blood. A normal hematocrit reading is about 39% to 50% in men and 35% to 45% in women; thus, 39% to 50% and 35% to 45% of the blood volume for men and women, respectively, consists of erythrocytes. Low hematocrit values often reﬂect reduced numbers of circulating erythrocytes (a condition called anemia) and may indicate significant blood loss caused by internal or external bleeding.

The median presenting leukocyte count is about 15,000/μL. Between 25 and 40% of patients have counts <5000/μL, and 20% have counts >100,000/μL. Fewer than 5% have no detectable leukemic cells in the blood. The morphology of the malignant cell varies in different subsets. In AML, the cytoplasm often contains primary (nonspecific) granules, and the nucleus shows fine, lacy chromatin with one or more nucleoli characteristic of immature cells. Abnormal rod-shaped granules called Auer rods are not uniformly present, but when they are, myeloid lineage is virtually certain (Fig. 132-1). Poor neutrophil function may be noted functionally by impaired phagocytosis and migration and morphologically by abnormal lobulation and deficient granulation.

Platelet counts <100,000/μL are found at diagnosis in ~75% of patients, and about 25% have counts <25,000/μL. Both morphologic and functional platelet abnormalities can be observed, including large and bizarre shapes with abnormal granulation and inability of platelets to aggregate or adhere normally to one another.

Pretreatment Evaluation Once the diagnosis of AML is suspected, a rapid evaluation and initiation of appropriate therapy should follow. In addition to clarifying the subtype of leukemia, initial studies should evaluate the overall functional integrity of the major organ systems, including the cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, and renal systems (Table 132-4). Factors that have prognostic significance, either for achieving CR or for predicting the duration of CR, should also be assessed before initiating treatment, including cytogenetics and molecular markers (see above). Leukemic cells should be obtained from all patients and cryopreserved for future use as new tests and therapeutics become available. All patients should be evaluated for infection.

Most patients are anemic and thrombocytopenic at presentation. Replacement of the appropriate blood components, if necessary, should begin promptly. Because qualitative platelet dysfunction or the presence of an infection may increase the likelihood of bleeding, evidence of hemorrhage justifies the immediate use of platelet transfusion, even if the platelet count is only moderately decreased.

Polycythemia is defined as an increase in the hemoglobin above normal. This increase may be real or only apparent because of a decrease in plasma volume (spurious or relative polycythemia). The term erythrocytosis may be used interchangeably with polycythemia, but some draw a distinction between them: erythrocytosis implies documentation of increased red cell mass, whereas polycythemia refers to any increase in red cells. Often patients with polycythemia are detected through an incidental finding of elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit levels. Concern that the hemoglobin level may be abnormally high is usually triggered at 170 g/L (17 g/dL) for men and 150 g/L (15 g/dL) for women. Hematocrit levels >50% in men or >45% in women may be abnormal. Hematocrits >60% in men and >55% in women are almost invariably associated with an increased red cell mass. Given that the machine that quantitates red cell parameters actually measures hemoglobin concentrations and calculates hematocrits, hemoglobin levels may be a better index.

Features of the clinical history that are useful in the differential diagnosis include smoking history; current living at high altitude; or a history of congenital heart disease, sleep apnea, or chronic lung disease.

Some centers have adopted more sensitive criteria, using values of <5.3 mmol/L (<95 mg/dL), <10 mmol/L (<180 mg/dL), <8.6 mmol/L (<155 mg/dL), and <7.8 mmol/L (<140 mg/dL) as the upper norms for a 3-h glucose tolerance test. Two elevated glucose values indicate a positive test. Adverse pregnancy outcomes for mother and fetus appear to increase with glucose as a continuous variable; thus it is challenging to define the optimal threshold for establishing the diagnosis of gestational diabetes.

Plasma glucose >7.8 mmol/L (>130 mg/dL) warrants administration of a 100-g oral glucose challenge with plasma glucose measurements obtained in the fasting state and at 1, 2, and 3 h. Normal plasma glucose concentrations at these time points are <5.8 mmol/L (<105 mg/dL), 10.5 mmol/L (190 mg/dL), 9.1 mmol/L (165 mg/dL), and 8.0 mmol/L (145 mg/dL), respectively. Some centers

Gestational diabetes occurs in approximately 4% of pregnancies. All pregnant women should be screened for gestational diabetes unless they are in a low-risk group. Women at low risk for gestational diabetes are those <25 years of age; those with a body mass index <25 kg/m2, no maternal history of macrosomia or gestational diabetes, and no diabetes in a first-degree relative; and those who are not members of a high-risk ethnic group (African American, Hispanic, Native American).

The spectrum of normal sexual response varies from one woman to another and throughout a woman’s lifetime (1–3). Physicians should be aware of their patients’ sexual values, attitudes about specific practices, and concerns about their sexuality. Maintaining open communication with patients about their sexuality allows the physician to counsel them about sexual issues and problems and other aspects of their reproductive health.

Sexual Activity Sexual activity among adolescents in the United States increased during the past 20 years (3). The average age for first intercourse for both men and women is 16 years. By 19 years of age, as many as three-quarters of women have had intercourse. Most young men and young women have multiple serial sexual partners but use condoms inconsistently, thereby exposing themselves to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and unintended pregnancies. A recent study of North American women, using a large and diverse community-based sample, shows that of the 3,205 women aged 30 to 79 years almost one-half were not sexually active in the previous 4 weeks, with 52% of those citing lack of interest and 61% citing lack of partner as the major reasons. Of those who were sexually active recently, 13.7% noted sexual problems and dissatisfaction with their overall sexual lives (4).

Anovulation Anovulatory bleeding can be too frequent, prolonged, or heavy, particularly after a long interval of amenorrhea. The physiology of this phenomenon relates to a failure of the feedback mechanism in which rising estrogen levels result in a decline in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) with subsequent decline of estrogen levels. In anovulatory cycles, estrogen secretion continues, resulting in endometrial proliferation with subsequent unstable growth and incomplete shedding. The clinical result is irregular, prolonged, and heavy bleeding.

Studies of adolescent menses show differences in rates of ovulation based on the number of months or years postmenarche. The younger the age at menarche, the sooner regular ovulation is established. In one study, the time from menarche until 50% of the cycles were ovulatory was 1 year for girls whose menarche occurred when they were younger than 12 years of age, 3 years for girls whose menarche occurred between 12 and 12.9 years of age, and 4.5 years for girls whose menarche occurred at 13 years of age or older (62).

Pregnancy-Related Bleeding The possibility of pregnancy must be considered when an adolescent seeks treatment for abnormal bleeding (Table 14.7). Bleeding in pregnancy can be associated with a spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy, or other pregnancy-related complications, such as a molar pregnancy. In the United States, 30% of 15-to 17-year-old adolescent girls have had sexual intercourse, as have 70.6% of those 18 to 19 years old (63). Issues of confidentiality for adolescent health care are critical to an adolescent’s willingness to seek appropriate reproductive health care (see Chapter 1).

Exogenous Hormones The cause of abnormal bleeding that is experienced while an individual is taking exogenous hormones usually is very different from bleeding that occurs without hormonal manipulation (64). Oral contraceptive use is associated with breakthrough bleeding, which occurs in as many as 30% to 40% of individuals during the first cycle of combination pill use. In addition, irregular bleeding can result from missed pills (65,66). Strict

Menopause typically occurs between 45 and 55 years of age. It extends over a period of several years. Initially the cycles become irregular and are periodically anovulatory. The cycles tend to shorten, primarily in the follicular phase. Eventually the woman ceases to cycle altogether. Serum estradiol levels drop to about a sixth the mean levels for younger cycling women, and progesterone levels drop to about a third those in the follicular phase of younger women. Production of these hormones does not cease entirely, but the primary source of these hormones in postmenopausal women becomes the adrenal, although interstitial cells of the ovarian stroma continue to produce some steroids. Most circulating estrogens are now produced peripherally from androgens. Because estrone is the primary estrogen produced in adipose tissue, it becomes the predominant estrogen in postmenopausal women.

Most symptoms associated with menopause result from estrogen deficiency. The vaginal epithelium atrophies and becomes dry, and bone loss is accelerated and may lead to osteoporosis. The incidence of coronary artery disease increases markedly after menopause. Hot flashes result from periodic increases in core temperature, which produces peripheral vasodilation and sweating. Hot flashes are thought to be linked to increases in LH release and are probably associated not with the pulsatile rise in LH secretion but rather with central mechanisms controlling GnRH release. Hot flashes typically subside within 1 to 5 years of the onset of menopausal symptoms.

The reproductive systems are composed of gonads, an internal reproductive tract with associated glands, and external genitalia. Mammary glands are accessory reproductive glands in women.

2.

Gonads have two main functions: production of gametes and production of hormones. Hormones (primarily sex steroids) are absolutely necessary for normal function of the reproductive system, and their production is regulated by a hypothalamic-pituitarygonadal axis.

Seminiferous tubules in the testis contain Sertoli cells and developing sperm cells.

bleeding usually prompts a woman to seek medical attention, infrequent or absent bleeding may seem less troubling and the patient may not bring it to the attention of the physician. Thus, a focused menstrual history is a critical part of every encounter with a female patient. Pelvic pain is a common complaint that may relate to an abnormality of the reproductive organs but also may be of gastrointestinal, urinary tract, or musculoskeletal origin. Depending on its cause, pelvic pain may require urgent surgical attention.

Amenorrhea refers to the absence of menstrual periods. Amenorrhea is classified as primary if menstrual bleeding has never occurred in the absence of hormonal treatment or secondary if menstrual periods cease for 3–6 months. Primary amenorrhea is a rare disorder that occurs in <1% of the female population. However, between 3 and 5% of women experience at least 3 months of secondary amenorrhea in any specific year. There is no evidence that race or ethnicity influences the prevalence of amenorrhea. However, because of the importance of adequate nutrition for normal reproductive function, both the age at menarche and the prevalence of secondary amenorrhea vary significantly in different parts of the world.

Oligomenorrhea is defined as a cycle length >35 days or <10 menses per year. Both the frequency and the amount of vaginal bleeding are irregular in oligomenorrhea, and moliminal symptoms (premenstrual breast tenderness, food cravings, mood lability), suggestive of ovulation, are variably present. Anovulation can also present with intermenstrual 335 intervals <24 days or vaginal bleeding for >7 days. Frequent or heavy irregular bleeding is termed dysfunctional uterine bleeding if anatomic uterine and outflow tract lesions or a bleeding diathesis has been excluded.

Decompensation may warrant balloon pericardiotomy and pericardial window.

Until recently, rheumatic fever (which affects the mitral valve more often than the aortic valve) was the most common cause of valvular heart disease in U.S. adults; the leading cause is now mechanical degeneration. Subtypes are listed in Table 2.1-18 along with their etiologies, presentation, diagnosis, and treatment.

Aortic aneurysms are most commonly associated with atherosclerosis. Most are abdominal, and > 90% originate below the renal arteries.

Usually asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on exam or radiologic study.

Risk factors include hypertension, high cholesterol, other vascular disease, a family history, smoking, gender (males > females), and age.

Exam demonstrates a pulsatile abdominal mass or abdominal bruits.

Ruptured aneurysm leads to hypotension and severe, tearing abdominal pain that radiates to the back.

Abdominal ultrasound for diagnosis or to follow an aneurysm over time. CT may be useful to determine the precise anatomy.

In asymptomatic patients, monitoring is appropriate for lesions < 5 cm.

Surgical repair is indicated if the lesion is > 5.5 cm (abdominal), > 6 cm (thoracic), or smaller but rapidly enlarging.

Emergent surgery for symptomatic or ruptured aneurysms.

A transverse tear in the intima of a vessel that results in blood entering the media, creating a false lumen and leading to a hematoma that propagates longitudinally. Most commonly 2° to hypertension. The most common sites of origin are above the aortic valve and distal to the left subclavian artery. Most often occurs at 40–60 years of age, with a greater frequency in males than in females.

Aortic aneurysm is most often associated with atherosclerosis, while aortic dissection is commonly linked to hypertension.

Sharp, fleeting chest pain or a prolonged, dull ache localized to the 1581 left submammary area is rarely due to myocardial ischemia. However, especially in women and diabetic patients, angina pectoris may be atypical in location and not strictly related to provoking factors. In addition, this symptom may exacerbate and remit over days, weeks, or months. Its occurrence can be seasonal, occurring more frequently in the winter in temperate climates. Anginal “equivalents” are symptoms of myocardial ischemia other than angina. They include dyspnea, nausea, fatigue, and faintness and are more common in the elderly and in diabetic patients.

Systematic questioning of a patient with suspected IHD is important to uncover the features of an unstable syndrome associated with increased risk, such as angina occurring with less exertion than in the past, occurring at rest, or awakening the patient from sleep. Since coronary atherosclerosis often is accompanied by similar lesions in other arteries, a patient with angina should be questioned and examined for peripheral arterial disease (intermittent claudication [Chap. 302]), stroke, or transient ischemic attacks (Chap. 446). It is also important to uncover a family history of premature IHD (<55 years in first-degree male relatives and <65 in female relatives) and the presence of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, cigarette smoking, and other risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis (Chap. 291e).

Signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary depending on the infecting organism and the patient’s immune status. In typical pneumonias, the usual presentation is a patient with high fever, rigors, productive cough, chills, and pleuritic chest pain. Chest radiography often will show infiltrates (11). The following agents, listed in decreasing order, cause two-thirds of all bacterial pneumonias: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus inﬂuenza, Klebsiella pneumoniae, gram-negative organisms, and anaerobic bacteria. Atypical pneumonias are more insidious in onset than typical pneumonias. Patients have moderate fever without the characteristic rigors and chills. Additional symptoms include a nonproductive cough, headache, myalgias, and mild leukocytosis. Chest radiography reveals bronchopneumonia with a diffuse interstitial pattern; characteristically, the patient does not appear to be as ill as the x-ray suggests. Common causes of atypical pneumonia include viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia pneumoniae (also called the TWAR agent), and other rare agents.

A strong index of suspicion is required for diagnosis, especially in elderly and immunocompromised individuals, who have altered response mechanisms. This is true with “typical agents.” Subtle clues in the elderly include changes in mentation, confusion, and exacerbation of other illnesses. The febrile response may be entirely absent, and the results of the physical examination are not predictive of pneumonia. In high-risk groups, an increased respiratory rate of greater than 25 breaths per minute remains the most reliable sign of infection. Mortality in these high-risk groups of patients is strongly correlated with the ability of the host to mount normal defenses to the symptoms of fever, chills, and tachycardia.

All women suspected of having pneumonia should undergo chest radiography to establish the diagnosis and to detect alternate diagnoses such as congestive heart failure and tumors.

Influenza is most frequently described as a respiratory illness characterized by systemic symptoms, such as headache, feverishness, chills, myalgia, and malaise, as well as accompanying respiratory tract signs and symptoms, particularly cough and sore throat. In some cases, the onset is so abrupt that patients can recall the precise time they became ill.

Diagnosis The history and pelvic examination are critical in the diagnosis of a pelvic mass. Considerations in adolescents include the anxiety associated with a first pelvic examination, as well as issues of confidentiality related to questions about sexual activity. Techniques for history taking and the performance of the first examination are discussed in Chapter 1.

Laboratory studies should always include a pregnancy test (regardless of stated sexual activity), and a complete blood count may be helpful in diagnosing inﬂammatory masses. Tumor markers, including α-fetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), may be elaborated by germ cell tumors and can be useful in preoperative diagnosis and follow-up (see Chapter 37).

As in all other age groups, the primary diagnostic technique for evaluating pelvic masses in adolescents is ultrasonography. Although transvaginal ultrasonographic examinations may provide more detail than transabdominal ultrasonography, particularly with inﬂammatory masses, a transvaginal examination may not be well tolerated by adolescents (111). Ultrasonography usually is the most helpful imaging technique for assessing ovarian masses. For cases in which the suspected diagnosis is appendicitis or another nongynecologic condition, or if the results of the ultrasonographic examination are inconclusive, CT or MRI may be helpful.

An accurate preoperative assessment of anatomy is critical, particularly in cases of uterovaginal

Differential Diagnosis of Adolescent Pelvic Masses malformations. MRI can be useful for evaluating this group of rare anomalies (88). Adolescents who present with abdominal pain should be evaluated with some type of imaging procedure because an unexpected finding of a complex uterine or vaginal anomaly requires careful surgical planning and management.

Other sexual dysfunctions. The presence of another sexual dysfunction does not rule out a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder. It is common for women to ex- perience more than one sexual dysfunction. For example, the presence of chronic genital pain may lead to a lack of desire for the (painful) sexual activity. Lack of interest and arousal during sexual activity may impair orgasmic ability. For some women, all aspects of the sexual response may be unsatisfying and distressing.

Inadequate or absent sexual stimuli. When differentialdiagnoses are being considered, it is important to assess the adequacy of sexual stimuli within the woman’s sexual experi- ence. In cases where inadequate or absent sexual stimuli are contributing to the clinical pic- ture, there may be evidence for clinical care, but a sexual dysfunction diagnosis would not be made. Similarly, transient and adaptive alterations in sexual functioning that are second- ary to a significant life or personal event must be considered in the differential diagnosis.

extremely common. Sexual distress and dissatisfaction with sex life are also highly cor— related in women with low sexual desire. Distressing low desire is associated with depres- sion, thyroid problems, anxiety, urinary incontinence, and other medical factors. Arthritis and inﬂammatory or irritable bowel disease are also associated with sexual arousal prob- lems. Low desire appears to be comorbid with depression, sexual and physical abuse in adulthood, global mental functioning, and use of alcohol.

Diagnostic Criteria 302.76 (F52.6)

A. Persistent or recurrent difficulties with one (or more) of the following: 1. Vaginal penetration during intercourse.

2. Marked vulvovaginal or pelvic pain during vaginal intercourse or penetration attempts.

3. Marked fear or anxiety about vulvovaginal or pelvic pain in anticipation of, during, or as a result of vaginal penetration.

4. Marked tensing or tightening of the pelvic floor muscles during attempted vaginal penetration.

The primary method used for cancer screening is cervical cytology via Pap smear. The guidelines of the American Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology recommend initiation of cervical cancer screening at age 21, regardless of the age of sexual debut. Women 21–29 years old with a normal Pap smear should have the test repeated every 3 years. Although adolescent and young women often test positive for HPV DNA, they are at very low risk of cervical cancer. Co-testing, or testing for HPV DNA at the time of the Pap smear, is not recommended for women in this age group because the presence of HPV DNA does not correlate with the presence of high-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia. Women 30–65 years of age should have a Pap smear every 3 years if testing for HPV DNA is not performed. The screening interval for women in this age group can be extended to every 5 years if co-testing results are negative. HPV testing is not recommended for partners of women with HPV or for screening for conditions other than cervical cancer.

Currently, there is no clear consensus regarding screening for anal cancer and its precursors, including high-grade anal intraepithelial lesions. This lack of clarity is due to an inadequate understanding of optimal treatment for lowor high-grade anal dysplasia found during cytologic screening. The current HIV treatment guidelines suggest that there may be a benefit to screening, but an effect on the associated morbidity and mortality of anal squamous cell cancer has not been consistently demonstrated.

A variety of treatment modalities are available for various HPV infections, but none has been proven to eliminate HPV from tissue adjacent to the destroyed and infected tissue. Treatment efficacies are limited by frequent recurrences (presumably due to reinfection acquired from an infected partner), reactivation of latent virus, or autoinoculation from nearby infected cells. The goals of treatment include prevention of virus transmission, eradication of premalignant lesions, and reduction of symptoms.

Treatment is generally successful in eliminating visible lesions and grossly diseased tissue. Different therapies are indicated for genital warts, vaginal and cervical disease, and perianal and anal disease.

Amenorrhea is classified as primary if menstrual bleeding has never occurred in the absence of hormonal treatment or secondary if menstrual periods cease for 3–6 months. Primary amenorrhea is a rare disorder that occurs in <1% of the female population. However, between 3 and 5% of women experience at least 3 months of secondary amenorrhea in any specific year.

The patient has no active complaints and says he feels healthy; however, he does not exercise regularly and lives a sedentary lifestyle. He is employed as an administrative position at a local college, and is seated at a desk most of the day. His father had a heart attack at age 54 and his mother is still alive with no health concerns. He does not smoke, only drinks socially, and does not use drugs. Today, his blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg, pulse is 84/min, and respiratory rate is 14/min. Physical examination reveals an obese male with no significant findings. An ECG shows no abnormalities, and laboratory testing shows the following:

A 32-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with weakness and hypokalemia. The patient had been very healthy until 2 months previously when he developed intermittent leg weakness. His review of systems was otherwise negative. He denied drug or laxative abuse and was on no medications. Past medical history was unremarkable, with no history of neuromuscular disease. Family history was notable for a sister with thyroid disease. Physical examination was notable only for reduced deep tendon reflexes.

This patient developed hypokalemia due to a redistribution of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular compartments; this pathophysiology was readily apparent following calculation of the TTKG. The TTKG is calculated as (P × U )/(P ×

U ). The expected values for the TTKG are <3 in the presence of hypokalemia and >7–8 in the presence of hyperkalemia (see also Case 2 and Case 8). Alternatively, a urinary K+-to-creatinine ratio of >13 mmol/g creatinine (>1.5 mmol/mmol creatinine) is compatible with excessive renal K+ excretion. In this case, the calculated TTKG was 2.5, consistent with appropriate renal conservation of K+ and a nonrenal cause for hypokalemia. In the absence of significant gastrointestinal loss of K+, the patient was diagnosed with a “redistributive” subtype of hypokalemia.

A 66-year-old obese Caucasian man presented to an academic Diabetes Center for advice regarding his diabetes treatment. His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61–1.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily). How would you treat this patient?

The endocrine pancreas in the adult human consists of approximately 1 million islets of Langerhans interspersed throughout the pancreatic gland. Within the islets, at least five hormone-producing cells are present (Table 41–1). Their hormone products include insulin, the storage and anabolic hormone of the body; islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP, or amylin), which modulates appetite, gastric emptying, and glucagon and insulin secretion; glucagon, the hyperglycemic factor that mobilizes glycogen stores; somatostatin, a universal inhibitor of secretory cells; pancreatic peptide, a small protein that facilitates digestive processes by a mechanism not yet clarified; and ghrelin, a peptide known to increase pituitary growth hormone release.

Insulin is a small protein with a molecular weight in humans of 5808. It contains 51 amino acids arranged in two chains (A and

A 65-year-old man has a history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease with baseline creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL. Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2–3+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?

Abnormalities in fluid volume and electrolyte composition are common and important clinical disorders. Drugs that block specific transport functions of the renal tubules are valuable clinical tools in the treatment of these disorders. Although various agents that increase urine volume (diuretics) have been described since antiquity, it was not until 1937 that carbonic anhydrase inhibitors were first described and not until 1957 that a much more useful and powerful diuretic agent (chlorothiazide) became available.

If the fasting plasma glucose level is less than 126 mg/dL (7 mMol/L) but diabetes is nonetheless suspected, then a standardized oral glucose tolerance test may be done (Table 41–4). The patient should eat nothing after midnight prior to the test day. On the morning of the test, adults are then given 75 g of glucose in 300 mL of water; children are given 1.75 g of glucose per kilogram of ideal body weight. The glucose load is consumed within 5 minutes. Blood samples for plasma glucose are obtained at 0 and 120 minutes after ingestion of glucose. An oral glucose tolerance test is normal if the fasting venous plasma glucose value is less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) and the 2-hour value falls below 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L). A fasting value of 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher or a 2-hour value of greater than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus. Patients with 2-hour value of 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.1 mmol/L) have impaired glucose tolerance.

B. Hemoglobin A1c Measurements

When plasma glucose levels are in the normal range, about 4–6% of hemoglobin A has one or both of the N terminal valines of their beta chains irreversibly glycated by glucose—referred to as hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). The HbA1c fraction is abnormally elevated in people with diabetes with chronic hyperglycemia. Since red cells have a lifespan of up to 120 days, the HbA1c value reflects plasma glucose levels over the preceding 8–12 weeks. In patients who monitor their glucose levels, the HbA1c value provides a valuable check on the accuracy of their monitoring. In patients who do not monitor their glucose levels, HbA1c measurements are essential for adjusting treatment. HbA1c can be used to diagnose diabetes. An HbA1c of 6.5% or greater if confirmed by repeat testing is diagnostic of diabetes. Less than 5.7% is normal, and patients with levels of 5.7–6.4% are considered at high risk for developing diabetes (Table 41–4).

2023-11-29 14:09:38,736 query: A 26-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 20 minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which she was a restrained passenger. On arrival, she is lethargic and incoherent. She has severe facial lacerations and is in respiratory distress. Her pulse is 130/min, respirations are 29/min, and blood pressure is 90/58 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 70%. Examination shows multiple facial lacerations. There is dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Her hemoglobin concentration is 12.1 g/dL. An x-ray of the chest shows a fractured left second rib, depression of the left mainstem bronchus, deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right, and a widened mediastinum.

Examination of the chest includes inspection of the chest wall to identify asymmetry resulting from absence of the pectoralis muscle and inspection of the breast tissue to determine gestational age and detect a breast abscess. Boys and girls may have breast engorgement and produce milk; milk expression should not be attempted. Supernumerary nipples may be bilateral and may be associated with renal anomalies.

Examination of the lungs includes observations of the rate, depth, and nature of intercostal or sternal retractions. Breath sounds should be equal on both sides of the chest, and rales should not be heard after the first 1 to 2 hours of life. Diminished or absent breath sounds on one side suggest pneumothorax, collapsed lung, pleural effusion, or diaphragmatic hernia. Shift of the cardiac impulse away from a tension pneumothorax and diaphragmatic hernia and toward the collapsed lung is a helpful physical finding for differentiating these disorders. Subcutaneous emphysema of the neck or chest also suggests a pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum, whereas bowel sounds auscultated in the chest in the presence of a scaphoid abdomen suggest a diaphragmatic hernia.

The position of the heart in infants is more midline than in older children. The first heart sound is normal, whereas the second heart sound may not be split in the first day of life. Decreased splitting of the second heart sound is noted in PPHN, transposition of the great vessels, and pulmonary atresia. Heart murmurs in newborns are common in the delivery room and during the first day of life. Most of these murmurs are transient and are due to closure of the ductus arteriosus, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, or a small ventral septal defect. Pulses should be palpated in the upper and lower extremities (over the brachial and femoral arteries). Blood pressure in the upper and lower extremities should be measured in all patients with a murmur or heart failure. An upperto-lower extremity gradient of more than 10 to 20 mm Hg suggests coarctation of the aorta.

A neck radiograph and coronal CT image of the neck demonstrates a cervical rib (eFig. 3.116).

Cervical ribs may produce three distinct disease entities:

Arterial compression and embolization—the cervical rib (or band) on the undersurface of the distal portion of the subclavian artery reduces the diameter of the vessel and allows eddy currents to form. Platelets aggregate and atheroma may develop in this region. This debris can be dislodged and flow distally within the upper limb vessels to block off blood flow to the fingers and the hand, a condition called distal embolization.

Tension on the T1 nerve—the T1 nerve, which normally passes over rib I, is also elevated by the presence of a cervical rib; thus the patient may experience a sensory disturbance over the medial aspect of the forearm, and develop wasting of the intrinsic muscles of the hand.

Compression of the subclavian vein—this may induce axillary vein thrombosis.

A Doppler ultrasound scan revealed marked stenosis of the subclavian artery at the outer border of the rib with abnormal flow distal to the narrowing. Within this region of abnormal flow there was evidence of thrombus adherent to the vessel wall.

This patient underwent surgical excision of the cervical rib and had no further symptoms.

A 52-year-old man presented with headaches and shortness of breath. He also complained of coughing up small volumes of blood. Clinical examination revealed multiple dilated veins around the neck. A chest radiograph demonstrated an elevated diaphragm on the right and a tumor mass, which was believed to be a primary bronchogenic carcinoma.

By observing the clinical findings and applying anatomical knowledge, the site of the tumor can be inferred.

The multiple dilated veins around the neck are indicative of venous obstruction. The veins are dilated on both sides of the neck, implying that the obstruction must be within a common vessel, the superior vena cava. Anterior to the superior vena cava in the right side of the chest is the phrenic nerve, which supplies the diaphragm. Because the diaphragm is elevated, suggesting paralysis, it is clear that the phrenic nerve has been involved with the tumor.

Figure 144-2 Transposition of the great vessels. AO, Aorta; LA, left atrium; LV, left ventricle; PA, pulmonary artery; RA, right atrium; RV, right ventricle.

Although dextroposed transposition of the great arteries represents only about 5% of congenital heart defects, it is the mostcommon cyanotic lesion to present in the newborn period(Fig. 144-2). Transposition of the great arteries is ventriculoarterial discordance secondary to abnormalities of septationof the truncus arteriosus. In dextroposed transposition, theaorta arises from the right ventricle, anterior and to the rightof the pulmonary artery, which arises from the left ventricle.This results in desaturated blood returning to the right sideof the heart and being pumped back out to the body, whilewell-oxygenated blood returning from the lungs enters the leftside of the heart and is pumped back to the lungs. Withoutmixing of the two circulations, death occurs quickly. Mixing can occur at the atrial (patent foramen ovale/atrial septal defect [ASD]), ventricular [VSD], or great vessel (patentductus arteriosus [PDA]) level.

A history of cyanosis is always present, although it depends on the amount of mixing. Quiet tachypnea and a single S2 are typically present. If the ventricular septum is intact, there may be no murmur.

Children with transposition and a large VSD have improved intracardiac mixing and less cyanosis. They may present with signs of heart failure. The heart is hyperdynamic, with palpable left and right ventricular impulses. A loud VSD murmur is heard. S2 is single.

ECG findings typically include right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy. The chest x-ray reveals increased pulmonary vascularity, and the cardiac shadow is classically an egg on a string created by the narrow superior mediastinum. Echocardiography shows the transposition of the great arteries, the sites and amount of mixing, and any associated lesions.

Other signs of suspected child abuse are spiral fractures in the limbs, bucket-handle fractures, bruises, and rib fractures.

Marfan’s syndrome, syphilis, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome all predispose to a weak aortic wall.

Aortic disruption is often associated with first and second rib, scapular, and sternal fractures.

Kehr’s sign: Referred shoulder pain due to diaphragmatic irritation (classically on the left due to spleen rupture).

Hx/PE: Presents with crepitus and abnormal chest wall movement. Abnormal chest wall movement may not be appreciated if the patient is splinting because of pain.

Dx: Primarily clinical, although CXR, O2 saturation, and blood gases may help.

Tx: O2, narcotic analgesia. Respiratory support, including intubation and mechanical ventilation, may be needed to treat hypoxemia in severe cases. Surgical fixation of the chest wall is generally needed.

Cx: Respiratory compromise is a complication due to underlying pulmonary contusion.

The spleen and liver are the most commonly injured organs following blunt abdominal trauma. Symptoms are consistent with signs of blood loss and include hypotension, tachycardia, and peritonitis. Suspect spleen or liver injury when lower rib fractures are present.

Pancreatic rupture should be suspected after a direct epigastric blow (handlebar injury).

C. Hypothyroidism and Pregnancy

Hypothyroid women frequently have anovulatory cycles and are therefore relatively infertile until restoration of the euthyroid state. This has led to the widespread use of thyroid hormone for infertility, although there is no evidence for its usefulness in infertile euthyroid patients. In a pregnant hypothyroid patient receiving thyroxine, it is extremely important that the daily dose of thyroxine be adequate because early development of the fetal brain depends on maternal thyroxine. In many hypothyroid patients, an increase in the thyroxine dose (about 25–30%) is required to normalize the serum TSH level during pregnancy. It is reasonable to counsel women to take one extra dose of their current thyroxine tablet twice a week separated by several days as soon as they are pregnant. Thyroxine should also be administered apart from prenatal vitamins and calcium by at least 4 hours. Because of the elevated maternal TBG levels and, therefore, elevated total T4 levels, adequate maternal thyroxine dosages warrant maintenance of TSH between 0.1 and 3.0 mIU/L (eg, first trimester, 0.1–2.5 mIU/L; second trimester, 0.2–3.0 mIU/L; third trimester, 0.3–3.0 mIU/L) and the total T4 at or above the upper range of normal.

D. Subclinical Hypothyroidism

Subclinical hypothyroidism, defined as an elevated TSH level and normal thyroid hormone levels, occurs in 4–10% of the general population and increases to 20% in women older than age 50. Levothyroxine should be individualized based on the risks and benefits of treatment. The consensus of expert thyroid organizations concluded that thyroid hormone therapy should be considered for patients with TSH levels greater than 10 mIU/L while close TSH monitoring is appropriate for those with lower TSH elevations.

E. Drug-Induced Hypothyroidism

document (1) 

If there is no residual thyroid function, the daily replacement dose By definition, subclinical hypothyroidism refers to biochemical of levothyroxine is usually 1.6 μg/kg body weight (typically 100–150 evidence of thyroid hormone deficiency in patients who have few μg), ideally taken at least 30 min before breakfast. In many patients, or no apparent clinical features of hypothyroidism. There are no universally accepted recommendations for the management of subclinical hypothyroidism, but levothyroxine is recommended if the patient is a woman who wishes to conceive or is pregnant, or when TSH levels are above 10 mIU/L. When TSH levels are below 10 mIU/L, treatment should be considered when patients have suggestive symptoms of hypothyroidism, positive TPO antibodies, or any evidence of heart disease. It is important to confirm that any elevation of TSH is sustained over a 3-month period before treatment is given. As long as excessive treatment is avoided, there is no risk in correcting a slightly increased TSH. Treatment is administered by starting with a low dose of levothyroxine (25–50 μg/d) with the goal of normalizing TSH. If levothyroxine is not given, thyroid function should be evaluated annually.

Rarely, levothyroxine replacement is associated with pseudotumor cerebri in children. Presentation appears to be idiosyncratic and occurs months after treatment has begun.

FIGURE 58-1 Gestational age specific values for serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels (black lines) and free thyroxine (T4) levels (blue lines). Data were derived from 17,298 women tested during pregnancy. For each color, the dark solid lines represent the 50th percentile, whereas the upper and lower light lines represent the 25th and 975th percentiles, respectively. (Data from Casey, 2005; Dashe, 2005.) by placental trophoblast. Because TSH does not cross the placenta, it has no direct fetal efects. During the irst 12 weeks of gestation, when maternal hCG serum levels are maximal, thyroid hormone secretion is stimulated. he resulting greater serum free thyroxine (T4) levels act to suppress hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and in turn limit pituitary TSH secretion (Fig.

Accordingly, TRH is undetectable in maternal serum. Conversely, in fetal serum, beginning at midpregnancy, TRH becomes detectable, but levels are static and do not increase.

hroughout pregnancy, maternal thyroxine is transferred to the fetus (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2017). Maternal thyroxine is important for normal fetal brain development, especially before the onset of fetal thyroid gland function (Bernal, 2007; Korevaar, 2016). And, even though the fetal gland begins concentrating iodine and synthesizing thyroid hormone after 12 weeks' gestation, maternal thyroxine contribution remains important. In fact, maternal sources account for 30 percent of thyroxine in fetal serum at term (horpe-Beeston, 1991). Still, developmental risks associated with maternal hypothyroidism after midpregnancy remain poorly understood (Morreale de Escobar, 2004; Sarkhail, 2016).

Most thyroid disorders are inextricably linked to autoantibodies against nearly 200 thyrocyte components. These antibodies variably stimulate thyroid function, block function, or cause thyroid inlammation that may lead to follicular cell destruction. Often, these efects overlap or even coexist.

document (3) 

3. In the woman with concurrent hyperthyroid Graves disease, regardless of whether it has preceded the onset of pregnancy, ATD treatment should be monitored and adjusted to keep free T4 in the high-normal range to prevent fetal hypothyroidism and minimize toxicity associated with higher doses of these medications. TSHR-Ab should be measured at the beginning of the last trimester, especially if the required ATD dosage is high. If the TSHRAb assay is negative or the level low, fetal–neonatal hyperthyroidism is rare. If antibody levels are high (TBII ≥40 U/L or TSAb ≥300%), evaluation of the fetus for hyperthyroidism is required. In this condition, there is usually a fair correlation between maternal and fetal thyroid function such that monitoring the ATD dosage according to the mother’s thyroid status is appropriate for the fetus. In some cases in which a high dose of ATD >20 mg/d of methimazole or >300 mg/d of propylthiouracil [PTU]) is necessary, there is a risk of goitrous hypothyroidism in the fetus, which might be indistinguishable from goitrous Graves disease. The correct diagnosis relies on the assay of fetal thyroid hormones and TSH, which allows for optimal treatment.

4. In any woman who has previously given birth to a newborn with hyperthyroidism, a TSHR-Ab assay should be performed early in the course of pregnancy.

A 52-year-old woman visited her family physician with complaints of increasing lethargy and vomiting. The physician examined her and noted that compared to previous visits she had lost significant weight. She was also jaundiced, and on examination of the abdomen a well-defined 10-cm rounded mass was palpable below the liver edge in the right upper quadrant (Fig. 4.185).

The clinical diagnosis was carcinoma of the head of the pancreas.

It is difficult to appreciate how such a precise diagnosis can be made clinically when only three clinical signs have been described.

The patient’s obstruction was in the distal bile duct.

When a patient has jaundice, the causes are excessive breakdown of red blood cells (prehepatic), hepatic failure (hepatic jaundice), and posthepatic causes, which include obstruction along the length of the biliary tree.

The patient had a mass in her right upper quadrant that was palpable below the liver; this was the gallbladder.

In healthy individuals, the gallbladder is not palpable. An expanded gallbladder indicates obstruction either within the cystic duct or below the level of the cystic duct insertion (i.e., the bile duct).

The patient’s vomiting was related to the position of the tumor.

It is not uncommon for vomiting and weight loss (cachexia) to occur in patients with a malignant disease. The head of the pancreas lies within the curve of the duodenum, primarily adjacent to the descending part of the duodenum. Any tumor mass in the region of the head of the pancreas is likely to expand and may encase and invade the duodenum. Unfortunately, in this patient’s case, this happened, producing almost complete obstruction. Further discussion with the patient revealed that she was vomiting relatively undigested food soon after each meal.

A CT scan demonstrated further complications.

Some patients will respond to bowel rest, broad-spectrum anti-biotics, parenteral nutrition, and granulocyte infusion or col-ony-stimulating factors.179 Evidence of perforation, generalized peritonitis, and deterioration in clinical condition are indications for operation.Neutropenic patients often develop perianal

What is the classic history? Nonspecific complaints occur first. Patients may notice changes in bowel habits or malaise and vague, perhaps intermittent, crampy, abdominal pain in the epigastric or periumbilical region. The pain subsequently migrates to the right lower quadrant over 12–24 h, where it is sharper and can be definitively localized as transmural inflammation when the appendix irritates the parietal peritoneum. Parietal peritoneal irritation may be associated with local muscle rigidity and stiffness. Patients with appendicitis

Migration of pain to right lower 50–60% quadrant will most often observe that their nausea, if present, followed the development of abdominal pain, which can help distinguish them from patients with gastroenteritis, for example, where nausea occurs first. Emesis, if present, also occurs after the onset of pain and is typically mild and scant. Thus, timing of the onset of symptoms and the characteristics of the patient’s pain and any associated findings must be rigorously assessed. Anorexia is so common that the diagnosis of appendicitis should be questioned in its absence.

Arriving at the correct diagnosis is even more challenging when the appendix is not located in the right lower quadrant, in women of childbearing age, and in the very young or elderly. Because the differential diagnosis of appendicitis is so broad, often the key question to answer expeditiously is whether the patient has appendicitis or some other condition that requires immediate operative intervention. A major concern is that the likelihood of a delay in diagnosis is greater if the appendix is unusually positioned. All patients should undergo a rectal examination. An inflamed appendix located behind the cecum or below the pelvic brim may prompt very little tenderness of the anterior abdominal wall.

Total anomalous pulmonary venous return accounts for about 1% of congenital heart disease (Fig. 144-5). Disruption of the development of normal pulmonary venous drainage during the third week of gestation results in one of four abnormalities. All of the pulmonary veins fail to connect to the left atrium and return abnormally via the right side of the heart. They may have supracardiac, infracardiac, cardiac, or mixed drainage. An atrial-level communication is required for systemic cardiac output and survival.

The most important determinant of presentation is the presenceor absence of obstruction to the pulmonary venous drainage.Infants without obstruction have minimal cyanosis and may beasymptomatic. There is a hyperactive right ventricular impulse with a widely split S2 (owing to increased right ventricular volume) and a systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternalborder. There is usually a mid-diastolic murmur at the lowerleft sternal border from the increased flow across the tricuspidvalve. Growth is relatively poor. Infants with obstruction present with cyanosis, marked tachypnea and dyspnea, and signs ofright-sided heart failure including hepatomegaly. The obstruction results in little, if any, increase in right ventricular volume,so there may be no murmur or changes in S2.

For infants without obstruction, the ECG is consistent with right ventricular volume overload. Cardiomegaly with

increased pulmonary blood flow is seen on chest x-ray. Infants with obstructed veins have right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy on ECG. On chest x-ray, the heart is normal or mildly enlarged with varying degrees of pulmonary edema that can appear similar to hyaline membrane disease or pneumonia. Echocardiography shows the volume-overloaded right side of the heart, right-to-left atrial level shunting, and common pulmonary vein site of drainage and degree of obstruction.

infants with enhanced ductal circulation.Extensive collateral circulation develops, predominantly involving the intercostals and mammary arteries as a direct result of aortic flow obstruction. This translates into the well-known finding of “rib-notching” on chest radiograph, as well as a prominent pulsation underneath the ribs.Other associated anomalies, such as ventricular septal defect, PDA, and ASD, may be seen with COA, but the most common is that of a bicuspid aortic valve, which can be demon-strated in 25% to 42% of cases.48Pathophysiology. Infants with COA develop symptoms con-sistent with left ventricular outflow obstruction, including

the peripheral pulmonary arteries. Most children, however, present with mild cyanosis at birth, which then pro-gresses as the right ventricular hypertrophy further compromises the RVOT. Cyanosis usually becomes significant within the first 6 to 12 months of life, and the child may develop characteristic “tet” spells, which are periods of extreme hypoxemia. These spells are characterized by decreased pulmonary blood flow and an increase in systemic blood flow. They can be triggered by any stimulus that decreases systemic vascular resistance, such as fever, agitation, or vigorous physical activity. Cyanotic spells increase in severity and frequency as

increases ventricular work.89The diagnosis of APW begins with the physical exami-nation, which may demonstrate a systolic flow murmur, a hyperdynamic precordium, and bounding peripheral pulses. The chest radiograph will show pulmonary overcirculation and cardiomegaly, and the ECG will usually demonstrate either left ventricular hypertrophy or biventricular hypertrophy. Echocar-diography (Fig. 20-24) can detect the defect and also provide information about associated anomalies. Retrograde aortogra-phy will confirm the diagnosis but is rarely necessary.Therapy. All infants with APW require surgical correction once the diagnosis is made. Repair is undertaken through a median sternotomy

fixation of the left crus of the diaphragm to the stomach at the 3 o’clock position, as viewed from the foot. This creates an anterior and posterior hernia sac, the latter of which is often filled with epiphrenic and retroperitoneal fat. These obser-vations point to the conclusion that the development of a hiatal hernia is an age-related phenomenon secondary to repetitive upward stretching of the phrenoesophageal membrane.Clinical ManifestationsThe clinical presentation of a giant hiatal (paraesophageal) her-nia differs from that of a sliding hernia.

Hernia Repair.  Controversy remains as to whether to perform an antireflux procedure at all, in selected cases only, or in all patients. Most advocate the routine addition of an antireflux procedure follow-ing repair of the hernia defect. There are several reasons for this. Physiologic testing with 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring has shown increased esophageal exposure to acid gastric juice in 60% to 70% of patients with a paraesophageal hiatal hernia, nearly identical to the observed 71% incidence in patients with a sliding hiatal hernia.

If a hernia is incarcerated, it cannot be reduced and generally requires surgical correction.

patient who worsens clinically should undergo repeat head CT to evaluate for hemorrhage or increas-ing mass effect from swelling, which typically peaks 3 to 5 days after the stroke. Significant swelling from an MCA or cerebellar stroke may cause herniation and brain stem injury. A decom-pressive hemicraniectomy or suboccipital craniectomy can be a life-saving intervention for these select stroke patients. In stud-ies of malignant MCA syndrome, decompressive hemicraniec-tomy showed favorable mortality and functional outcomes.59 This treatment option, however, should be considered with the understanding of potentially poor functional recovery regardless of therapy.

Some patients with heat exhaustion develop heatstroke after removal from the heat-stress environment. Aggressive cooling of non-responders is indicated until their core temperature is 39°C (102.2°F). Except in mild cases, free water deficits should be replaced slowly over 24–48 h to avoid a decrease of serum osmolality by >2 mOsm/h.

The disposition of younger, previously healthy heat-exhaustion patients who have no major laboratory abnormalities may include hospital observation and discharge after IV rehydration. Older patients with comorbidities (including cardiovascular disease) or predisposing factors often require inpatient fluid and electrolyte replacement, monitoring, and reassessment.

The clinical manifestations of heatstroke reflect a total loss of thermo-regulatory function. Typical vital-sign abnormalities include tachypnea, various tachycardias, hypotension, and a widened pulse pressure. Although there is no single specific diagnostic test, the historical and physical triad of exposure to a heat stress, CNS dysfunction, and a core temperature >40.5°C helps establish the preliminary diagnosis.

The definitive diagnosis should be reserved until the other potential causes of hyperthermia are excluded. Many of the usual laboratory abnormalities seen with heatstroke overlap with other conditions. If the patient's mental status does not improve with cooling, toxicologic screening may be indicated, and cranial CT and spinal fluid analysis can be considered.

The premonitory clinical characteristics may be nonspecific and include weakness, dizziness, disorientation, ataxia, and gastrointestinal or psychiatric symptoms. These prodromal symptoms often resemble heat exhaustion. The sudden onset of heatstroke occurs when the maintenance of adequate perfusion requires peripheral vasoconstriction to stabilize the mean arterial blood pressure. As a result, the cutaneous radiation of heat ceases. At this juncture, the core temperature rises dramatically. Since many patients with heatstroke also meet the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome and have a broad differential diagnosis, rapid cooling is essential during the extensive diagnostic evaluation (Table 479e-1).

Another typical feature of MS is the temporary induction, by heat or exercise, of symptoms such as unilateral visual blurring (the Uhthoff phenomenon) or tingling and weakness of a limb (the basis of the hot-tub test used in previous years). This has been shown experimentally to represent an extreme sensitivity of conduction in demyelinated nerve fibers to an elevation in temperature. A rise of only 0.5°C (0.9°F) can block electrical transmission in thinly myelinated or demyelinated fibers. Likewise, hyperventilation slows conduction of the visual evoked response, an effect that is rarely perceived by the patient. The remarkable sensitivity of demyelinated and remyelinated regions to subtle metabolic and environmental changes provides an explanation for the rapid onset of symptoms in some patients and the apparent fluctuations of MS that show no laboratory evidence of active inflammatory changes in the CNS. Smoking, fatigue, hyperventilation, and a rise in environmental temperature are all capable of briefly worsening neurologic functioning and are easily confused with relapses of disease.

Weakness or numbness, sometimes both, in one or more limbs is the initial symptom in about one-half of patients. Symptoms of tingling of the extremities and tight band-like sensations around the trunk or limbs are commonly associated and are probably the result of involvement of the posterior columns of the spinal cord. The symptoms generally appear over hours or days, at times being so trifling that they are ignored, and other times coming on so acutely and prominently as to bring the patient urgently to the doctor. The resulting clinical syndromes vary from a mere dragging or poor control of one or both legs to a spastic or ataxic paraparesis. The tendon reflexes are retained and later become hyperactive with extensor plantar reflexes; varying degrees of deep and superficial sensory loss may be associated. It is a useful adage that the patient with MS often presents with symptoms in one leg but with signs in both; the patient will complain of weakness, incoordination, or numbness and tingling in one lower limb and prove to have bilateral Babinski signs and other evidence of bilateral corticospinal and posterior column disease.

Nuchal rigidity (“stiff neck”) is the pathognomonic sign of meningeal irritation and is present when the neck resists passive flexion. Kernig’s and Brudzinski’s signs are also classic signs of meningeal irritation. Kernig’s sign is elicited with the patient in the supine position. The thigh is flexed on the abdomen, with the knee flexed; attempts to passively extend the knee elicit pain when meningeal irritation is present. Brudzinski’s sign is elicited with the patient in the supine position and is positive when passive flexion of the neck results in spontaneous flexion of the hips and knees. Although commonly tested on physical examinations, the sensitivity and specificity of Kernig’s and Brudzinski’s signs are uncertain. Both may be absent or reduced in very young or elderly patients, immunocompromised individuals, or patients with a severely depressed

Meningitis, Encephalitis, Brain Abscess, and Empyema mental status. The high prevalence of cervical spine disease in older individuals may result in false-positive tests for nuchal rigidity.

document (3) 

In all but the deepest stages of coma, meningeal irritation from either bacterial meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage will cause resistance to the initial excursion of passive flexion of the neck but not to extension, turning, or tilting of the head. Meningismus is a fairly specific but somewhat insensitive sign of meningeal irritation as commented in Chap. 1. Resistance to movement of the neck in all directions may be part of generalized muscular rigidity or dystonia or indicate disease of the cervical spine. In the infant, bulging of the anterior fontanel is at times a more reliable sign of meningitis than is a stiff neck. A temporal lobe or cerebellar herniation or decerebrate rigidity may also create resistance to passive flexion of the neck and be confused with meningeal irritation.

A coma-causing lesion in a cerebral hemisphere can be detected by careful observation of spontaneous movements, responses to stimulation, prevailing postures, and by examination of the cranial nerves. Hemiplegia is revealed by a lack of restless movements of the limbs on one side and by inadequate protective movements in response to painful stimuli. The weakened limbs are usually slack and, if lifted from the bed, they “fall flail.” The hemiplegic leg lies in a position of external rotation (this may also be caused by a fractured femur), and the affected thigh appears wider and flatter than the nonhemiplegic one. In expiration, the cheek and lips puff out on the paralyzed side of the face. A lesion in one cerebral hemisphere causes the eyes to be turned away from the paralyzed side (toward the lesion, as described below); the opposite occurs with brainstem lesions. In most cases, a hemiplegia and an accompanying Babinski sign are indicative of a contralateral hemispheral lesion; but with lateral mass effect and compression of the opposite cerebral peduncle against the tentorium, extensor posturing, a Babinski sign, and weakness of arm and leg may appear ipsilateral to the lesion (the earlier-mentioned Kernohan-Woltman sign). A moan or grimace may be provoked by painful stimuli applied to one side but not to the other, reflecting hemianesthesia. During grimacing in response to stimuli, facial weakness may be noted.

Examination of the chest includes inspection of the chest wall to identify asymmetry resulting from absence of the pectoralis muscle and inspection of the breast tissue to determine gestational age and detect a breast abscess. Boys and girls may have breast engorgement and produce milk; milk expression should not be attempted. Supernumerary nipples may be bilateral and may be associated with renal anomalies.

Examination of the lungs includes observations of the rate, depth, and nature of intercostal or sternal retractions. Breath sounds should be equal on both sides of the chest, and rales should not be heard after the first 1 to 2 hours of life. Diminished or absent breath sounds on one side suggest pneumothorax, collapsed lung, pleural effusion, or diaphragmatic hernia. Shift of the cardiac impulse away from a tension pneumothorax and diaphragmatic hernia and toward the collapsed lung is a helpful physical finding for differentiating these disorders. Subcutaneous emphysema of the neck or chest also suggests a pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum, whereas bowel sounds auscultated in the chest in the presence of a scaphoid abdomen suggest a diaphragmatic hernia.

The position of the heart in infants is more midline than in older children. The first heart sound is normal, whereas the second heart sound may not be split in the first day of life. Decreased splitting of the second heart sound is noted in PPHN, transposition of the great vessels, and pulmonary atresia. Heart murmurs in newborns are common in the delivery room and during the first day of life. Most of these murmurs are transient and are due to closure of the ductus arteriosus, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, or a small ventral septal defect. Pulses should be palpated in the upper and lower extremities (over the brachial and femoral arteries). Blood pressure in the upper and lower extremities should be measured in all patients with a murmur or heart failure. An upperto-lower extremity gradient of more than 10 to 20 mm Hg suggests coarctation of the aorta.

Cardiac Murmurs Heart murmurs result from audible vibrations that are caused by increased turbulence and are defined by their timing within the cardiac cycle. Not all murmurs are indicative of structural heart disease, and the accurate identification of a benign or functional systolic murmur often can obviate the need for additional testing in healthy subjects. The duration, frequency, configuration, and intensity of a heart murmur are dictated by the magnitude, variability, and duration of the responsible pressure difference between two cardiac chambers, the two ventricles, or the ventricles and their respective great arteries. The intensity of a heart murmur is graded on a scale of 1 to 6; a thrill is present with murmurs of grade 4 or greater intensity. Other attributes of the murmur that aid in its accurate identification include its location, radiation, and response to bedside maneuvers. Although clinicians can detect and correctly identify heart murmurs with only fair reliability, a careful and complete bedside examination usually can identify individuals with valvular heart disease for whom transthoracic echocardiography and clinical follow-up are indicated and exclude subjects for whom no further evaluation is necessary.

Systolic murmurs can be early, mid, late, or holosystolic in timing (Fig. 267-5). Acute severe MR results in a decrescendo early systolic murmur, the characteristics of which are related to the progressive attenuation of the left ventricular to left atrial pressure gradient during systole because of the steep and rapid rise in left atrial pressure in this context. Severe MR associated with posterior leaflet prolapse or flail radiates anteriorly and to the base, where it can be confused with the murmur of AS. MR that is due to anterior leaflet involvement radiates posteriorly and to the axilla. With acute TR in patients with normal pulmonary artery pressures, an early systolic murmur that may increase in intensity with inspiration may be heard at the left lower sternal border, with regurgitant cv waves visible in the jugular venous pulse.

Inspection and Palpation In patients with severe MS, there may be a malar flush with pinched and blue facies. In patients with sinus rhythm and severe pulmonary hypertension or associated tricuspid stenosis (TS), the jugular venous pulse reveals prominent a waves due to vigorous right atrial systole. The systemic arterial pressure is usually normal or slightly low. An RV tap along the left sternal border signifies an enlarged RV. A diastolic thrill may rarely be present at the cardiac apex, with the patient in the left lateral recumbent position.

Auscultation The first heart sound (S1) is usually accentuated in the early stages of the disease and slightly delayed. The pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P2) also is often accentuated with elevated PA pressures, and the two components of the second heart sound (S2) are closely split. The opening snap (OS) of the mitral valve is most readily audible in expiration at, or just medial to, the cardiac apex. This sound generally follows the sound of aortic valve closure (A2) by 0.05–0.12 s. The time interval between A2 and OS varies inversely with the severity of the MS. The OS is followed by a low-pitched, rumbling, diastolic murmur, heard best at the apex with the patient in the left lateral recumbent position (see Fig. 267-5); it is accentuated by mild exercise (e.g., a few rapid sit-ups) carried out just before auscultation. In general, the duration of this murmur correlates with the severity of the stenosis in patients with preserved CO. In patients with sinus rhythm, the murmur often reappears or becomes louder during atrial systole (presystolic accentuation). Soft, grade I or II/VI systolic murmurs are commonly heard at the apex or along the left sternal border in patients with pure MS and do not necessarily signify the presence of MR. Hepatomegaly, ankle edema, ascites, and pleural effusion, particularly in the right pleural cavity, may occur in patients with MS and RV failure.

An annual DRE after age 50 is the recommended screening method for prostate cancer.

Suggested by clinical findings and/or a markedly ↑PSA (> 4 ng/mL).

Definitive diagnosis is made with ultrasound-guided transrectal biopsy, which typically shows adenocarcinoma.

Tumors are graded by the Gleason histologic system, which sums the scores (from 1 to 5) of the two most dysplastic samples (10 is the highest grade).

Look for metastases with CXR and bone scan (metastatic lesions show an osteoblastic or ↑ bone density). Fully 40% of patients present with metastatic disease at diagnosis.

Treatment is controversial, as many cases of prostate cancer are slow to progress. Treatment choice is based on the aggressiveness of the tumor and the patient’s mortality risk.

Watchful waiting may be the best approach for elderly patients with low-grade tumors.

Radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy (e.g., brachytherapy or external beam) are associated with an ↑ risk of incontinence and/or impotence.

PSA, while controversial as a screening test, is used to follow patients post-treatment to evaluate for disease recurrence.

Treat metastatic disease with androgen ablation (e.g., GnRH agonists, orchiectomy, ﬂutamide) and chemotherapy.

All males > 50 years of age should have an annual DRE. Screening should begin earlier in African-American males and in those with a first-degree relative with prostate cancer.

Screening with PSA is common, but its utility remains controversial.

The second most common urologic cancer and the most frequent malignant tumor of the urinary tract; usually a transitional cell carcinoma. Most prevalent in males during the sixth and seventh decades. Risk factors include smoking, diets rich in meat and fat, schistosomiasis, chronic treatment with cyclophosphamide, and occupational exposure to aniline dye (a benzene derivative).

Gross hematuria is the most common presenting symptom.

The typical age of presentation is 30–50 years, and males predominate. The clinical presentation is usually insidious and is manifested by progressive exertional dyspnea, fatigue, weight loss, and low-grade fever. A nonproductive cough is common, but occasionally expectoration of “chunky” gelatinous material may occur. Polycythemia, hypergammaglobulinemia, and increased LDH levels are common. Markedly elevated serum levels of lung surfactant proteins A and D have been found in PAP. In the absence of any known secondary cause of PAP, an elevated serum anti-GM-CSF titer is highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of acquired PAP. BAL fluid levels of anti-GM-CSF antibodies correlate better with the severity of PAP than do serum titers. Radiographically, bilateral symmetric alveolar opacities located centrally in middle and lower lung zones result in a “bat-wing” distribution. HRCT shows a ground-glass opacification and thickened intralobular structures and interlobular septa.

Histologic Findings This diffuse disease is characterized by the accumulation of an amorphous, periodic acid–Schiff–positive lipoproteinaceous material in the distal air spaces. There is little or no lung inflammation, and the underlying lung architecture is preserved.

Treatment Whole-lung lavage(s) through a double-lumen endotracheal tube provides relief to many patients with dyspnea or progressive hypoxemia and also may provide long-term benefit.

Medical therapy includes α-blockers (e.g., terazosin), which relax smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, as well as 5α-reductase inhibitors (e.g., finasteride), which inhibit the production of dihydrotestosterone.

Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) or open prostatectomy is appropriate for patients with moderate to severe symptoms.

The most common cancer in men and the second leading cause of cancer death in men (after lung cancer). Risk factors include advanced age and a family history.

Usually asymptomatic, but may present with obstructive urinary symptoms (e.g., urinary retention, a ↓ in the force of the urine stream) as well as with lymphedema due to obstructing metastases, constitutional symptoms, and back pain due to bone metastases.

DRE may reveal a palpable nodule or an area of induration. Early carcinoma is usually not detectable on exam.

A tender prostate suggests prostatitis.

What drugs are an absolute contraindication to sildenaf l? Nitrates (the combined effect of ↓ BP can lead to myocardial ischemia).

BPH most commonly occurs in the central (periurethral) zone of the prostate and may not be detected on DRE.

The major side effect of α-blockers is orthostatic hypotension.

Leading causes of cancer death in men: 1. Lung cancer 2. Prostate cancer 3. Colorectal cancer 4. Pancreatic cancer 5. Leukemia

An elevated PSA may be due to BPH, prostatitis, UTI, prostatic trauma, or carcinoma.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common malignancy, found in 75% of thyroid cancers. For unclear reasons the incidence of papillary cancer increased by almost threefold in the past 30 years, from 2.7 to 7.7 per 100,000 people (55). This may represent the more ready diagnosis of smaller cancers. The majority of cancers are found incidentally during routine examinations. Risk factors include a history of radiation exposure during childhood and family history. Signs include rapid growth of neck mass, new onset hoarseness, or vocal cord paralysis. In the setting of rapid growth, fixed nodule, new onset hoarseness, or the presence of lymphadenopathy, it is important to be sure a fine-needle aspiration is done. Thyroidectomy is the primary treatment with radioactive iodine and TSH suppression with thyroxine. Patients younger than 50 years of age with a primary tumor of less than 4 cm at presentation, even with associated cervical lymph node metastasis, are usually cured. In the elderly, anaplastic tumors have a poor prognosis and progress rapidly despite therapy.

Follicular thyroid cancer is the second most common thyroid cancer, comprising up to 10% of cases. These tend to occur in an older population with peak ages of 40 to 60. It has a threefold greater prevalence in women than men. This form of cancer tends to have vascular invasion, frequently with distant metastases. The prognosis tends to be less favorable with this form of cancer than with papillary cancers, although women do have a better prognosis than men.

2023-11-29 14:09:43,277 query: A 17-year-old female is brought to the emergency room by her father because she has been experiencing shortness of breath and chest pain. She says that the chest pain is worse when she breathes or coughs. Furthermore, on the way to the hospital she noticed that there were specks of blood on a tissue that she coughed into. She has no previous medical history and does not recall anything that could have provoked these symptoms. On presentation her temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 107/65 mmHg, pulse is 102/min, respirations are 21/min, and O2 saturation is 91% on room air. Further testing shows a large filling defect in the pulmonary vessels, and the patient is started on an appropriate treatment intravenously. After drug administration, the effects of the drug are monitored using a standard blood test. Surprisingly, the test results come back within normal parameters.

The mainstays of therapy for type II respiratory failure are directed at reversing the underlying cause(s) of ventilatory failure. Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation with a tight-fitting facial or nasal mask, with avoidance of endotracheal intubation, often stabilizes these patients. This approach has been shown to be beneficial in treating patients with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; it has been tested less extensively in other kinds of respiratory failure but may be attempted nonetheless in the absence of contraindications (hemodynamic instability, inability to protect the airway, respiratory arrest).

ventilation may also be used to reverse regional atelectasis.

This form results from hypoperfusion of respiratory muscles in patients in shock. Normally, respiratory muscles consume <5% of total cardiac output and oxygen delivery. Patients in shock often experience respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema (e.g., in cardiogenic shock), lactic acidosis, and anemia. In this setting, up to 40% of cardiac output may be distributed to the respiratory muscles. Intubation and mechanical ventilation can allow redistribution of the cardiac output away from the respiratory muscles and back to vital organs while the shock is treated.

document (1) 

The respiratory system can be divided into two components: the lungs and the chest wall. Normally, respiratory system compliance is ~100 mL/cmH2O. Pathophysiologic processes such as pleural effusions, pneumothorax, and increased abdominal girth all reduce chest wall compliance. Lung compliance may be reduced by pneumonia, pulmonary edema, interstitial lung disease, or auto-PEEP. Accordingly, patients with abnormalities in compliance of the respiratory system (lungs and/or chest wall) typically have elevated peak and plateau airway pressures but a normal gradient between these two pressures. Auto-PEEP occurs when there is insufficient time for emptying of alveoli before the next inspiratory cycle. Since the alveoli have not decompressed completely, alveolar pressure remains positive at the end of exhalation (functional residual capacity). This phenomenon results most commonly from critical narrowing of distal airways in disease processes such as asthma and COPD. Auto-PEEP with resulting alveolar overdistention may result in diminished lung compliance, reflected by abnormally increased plateau airway pressures. Modern mechanical ventilators allow breath-to-breath display of pressure and flow, permitting detection of problems such as patient-ventilator dyssynchrony, airflow obstruction, and auto-PEEP (Fig. 321–6).

Oxygen delivery (QO2) is a function of cardiac output and the content of O2 in the arterial blood (CaO2). The CaO2 is determined by the hemoglobin concentration, the arterial hemoglobin saturation, and dissolved O2 not bound to hemoglobin. For normal adults:

QO2 = 50 dL/min × (1.39 × 15 g/dL [hemoglobin concentration] × 1.0 [hemoglobin % saturation] + 0.0031 × 100 [PaO2]) = 50 dL/min (cardiac output) × 21.6 mL O2 per dL blood (CaO2)

document (2) 

In cases of severe acute lung injury, providing adequate oxygenation of peripheral tissues is balanced against maneuvers that further aggravate lung injury. At least intuitively, increasing oxygen delivery should produce a corresponding increase in tissue uptake, but this is diicult to measure. Support of systemic perfusion with intravenous crystalloid and blood is imperative. As discussed earlier, the trial conducted by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (2006) showed that pulmonary artery catheter use did not improve outcomes. Because sepsis is commonplace in lung injury, vigorous antimicrobial therapy is given for infection, and any necrotic tissues are debrided. Oxygen delivery can be greatly improved by correction of anemia. Speciically, each gram of hemoglobin carries 1.25 mL of oxygen when 90-percent saturated. By comparison, increasing the arterial P02 from 100 to 200 mm Hg results in the transport of only 0.1 mL of additional oxygen for each 100 mL of blood.

Reasonable goals in caring for the woman with severe lung injury are to attain a Pao2 of 60 mm Hg or 90-percent oxygen saturation using an inspired oxygen content < 50 percent and positive end-expiratory pressures < 15 mm Hg. With regard to the pregnancy, it remains controversial whether delivery of the fetus improves maternal oxygenation (Mallampalli, 2010). In a study of 29 women undergoing mechanical ventilation, 10 were delivered while intubated (Lapinsky, 2015). This was associated with a modest improvement in respiratory function in perhaps half, but no factors were identiied that predicted a better outcome.

Pulmonary Function Testing (See also Chap. 307) The initial pulmonary function test obtained is spirometry. This study is an effort-dependent test used to assess for obstructive pathophysiology as seen in asthma, COPD, and bronchiectasis. A diminished-forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) (often defined as <70% of the predicted value) is diagnostic of obstruction. In addition to measuring FEV1 and FVC, the clinician should examine the flow-volume loop (which is effort-independent). A plateau of the inspiratory and expiratory curves suggests large-airway obstruction in extrathoracic and intrathoracic locations, respectively.

Spirometry with symmetric decreases in FEV1 and FVC warrants further testing, including measurement of lung volumes and the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). A total lung capacity <80% of the predicted value for a patient’s age, race, sex, and height defines restrictive pathophysiology. Restriction can result from parenchymal disease, neuromuscular weakness, or chest wall or pleural diseases. Restriction with impaired gas exchange, as indicated by a decreased DLCO, suggests parenchymal lung disease. Additional testing, such as measurements of maximal expiratory pressure and maximal inspiratory pressure, can help diagnose neuromuscular weakness. Normal spirometry, normal lung volumes, and a low DLCO should prompt further evaluation for pulmonary vascular disease.

Arterial blood gas testing is often helpful in assessing respiratory 1663 disease. Hypoxemia, while usually apparent with pulse oximetry, can be further evaluated with the measurement of arterial PO2 and the calculation of an alveolar gas and arterial blood oxygen tension difference ([A–a]DO2). Patients with diseases that cause ventilation-perfusion mismatch or shunt physiology have an increased (A–a) DO2 at rest. Arterial blood gas testing also allows the measurement of arterial PCO2. Hypercarbia can accompany severe airway obstruction (e.g., COPD) or progressive restrictive physiology, as in patients with neuromuscular weakness.

H. influenzae type b, GBS, N. meningitidis, herpes simplex virus [HSV], enteroviruses), bacterial diarrhea (Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli), and osteomyelitis or septic arthritis (S. aureus or GBS).

Differentiation between viral and bacterial infections in young infants is difficult. Febrile infants <3 months of age who appear ill, especially if follow-up is uncertain, and all febrile infants <4 weeks of age should be admitted to the hospital for empirical antibiotics pending culture results. After blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures are obtained, broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics (typically ampicillin with cefotaxime or gentamicin) are administered. The choice of antibiotics depends on the pathogens suggested by localizing findings. The possibility of neonatal HSV should also be considered in febrile children <4 weeks old, and empirical acyclovir begun in those in whom neonatal HSV is a concern. Well-appearing febrile infants ≥4 weeks of age without an identifiable focus and with certainty of follow-up are at a low risk of developing a serious bacterial infection (0.8% develop bacteremia, and 2% develop a serious localized bacterial infection). Specific criteria identifying these low-risk infants include age older than 1 month, well-appearing without a focus of infection, no history of prematurity or prior antimicrobial therapy, a white blood cell (WBC) count of 5000 to 15,000/μL, and urine with less than 10 WBCs/high-power field. Fecal leukocyte testing and chest radiograph can be considered in infants with diarrhea or respiratory signs. Low-risk infants may be followed as outpatients without empirical antibiotic treatment, or, alternatively, may be treated with intramuscular ceftriaxone. Regardless of antibiotic treatment, close follow-up for at least 72 hours, including re-evaluation in 24 hours or immediately with any clinical change, is essential.

Most episodes of fever in children younger than 3 years of age have a demonstrable source of infection elicited by history, physical examination, or a simple laboratory test. In this age group, the most commonly identified serious bacterial infection is a UTI. A blood culture to evaluate for occult bacteremia, and urinalysis and urine culture to evaluate for a UTI, should be considered for all children younger than 3 years of age with fever without localizing signs. Stool culture should be obtained in those with diarrhea marked by blood or mucous. Ill-appearing children should be admitted to the hospital and treated with empirical antibiotics.

Approximately 0.2% of well-appearing febrile children 3 to 36 months of age vaccinated against S. pneumoniae and

H. influenzae and without localizing signs have occult bacteremia. Risk factors for occult bacteremia include temperature of 102.2° F (39° C) or greater, WBC count of 15,000/mm3 or more, and elevated absolute neutrophil count, band count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or C-reactive protein. No combination of demographic factors (socioeconomic status, race, gender, and age), clinical parameters, or laboratory tests in these children reliably predicts occult bacteremia. Occult bacteremia in otherwise healthy children is usually transient and self-limited but may progress to serious localizing infections. Well-appearing children usually are followed as

Perform an LP; send cell count with differential, glucose and protein levels, Gram stain, and culture.

Empiric antibiotic therapy regimens (ceftriaxone, vancomycin, ampicillin) should be administered until bacterial meningitis can be excluded.

Neonates should receive ampicillin and cefotaxime or gentamicin. Consider acyclovir if there is concern for herpes encephalitis (e.g., if the mother had HSV lesions at the time of the infant’s birth).

Older children should receive ceftriaxone and vancomycin.

A bacterial infection caused by Bordetella pertussis (whooping cough), a grambacillus. The DTaP vaccine (given in five doses in early childhood) is protective, but immunity wanes by adolescence.

CHAPTER 31 Numbness, Tingling, and Sensory Loss 162 the affected hand and arm. On cortical sensory testing (e.g., two-point discrimination, graphesthesia), abnormalities are often found but primary sensation is usually intact. Anterior parietal infarction may present as a pseudothalamic syndrome with contralateral loss of primary sensation from head to toe. Dysesthesias or a sense of numbness and, rarely, a painful state may also occur.

Focal Sensory Seizures These seizures generally are due to lesions in the area of the postcentral or precentral gyrus. The principal symptom of focal sensory seizures is tingling, but additional, more complex sensations may occur, such as a rushing feeling, a sense of warmth, or a sense of movement without detectable motion. Symptoms typically are unilateral; commonly begin in the arm or hand, face, or foot; and often spread in a manner that reflects the cortical representation of different bodily parts, as in a Jacksonian march. Their duration is variable; seizures may be transient, lasting only for seconds, or persist for an hour or more. Focal motor features may supervene, often becoming generalized with loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic jerking.

PART 2 Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases

PREVALENCE, MORBIDITY, AND MORTALITY

Gait and balance problems are common in the elderly and contribute to the risk of falls and injury. Gait disorders have been described in 15% of individuals older than 65. By age 80 one person in four will use a mechanical aid to assist with ambulation. Among those 85 and older, the prevalence of gait abnormality approaches 40%. In epidemiologic studies, gait disorders are consistently identified as a major risk factor for falls and injury.

document (2) 

Less-well appreciated is the occurrence of a slowly progressive vestibulopathy for which no cause can be discerned. The disorder affects men and women alike, with onset in middle or late adult life with the main abnormalities being unsteadiness of gait, which is worse in the dark or with eyes closed, and oscillopsia, which occurs with head movements and is particularly noticeable when walking. Vertigo and hearing loss are absent, as are other neurologic abnormalities. Bilateral vestibular loss can be documented with caloric and rotational testing. Baloh and colleagues, in a report of 22 patients with idiopathic vestibulopathy of this type, found that a significant proportion (9 of 22 cases) had a prior history of prolonged episodes of vertigo consistent with the diagnosis of bilateral sequential vestibular neuritis (see the following text).

This was the term applied originally by Dix and Hallpike to a distinctive disturbance of vestibular function, characterized clinically by a paroxysmal and usually a prolonged single attack of vertigo and by a conspicuous absence of tinnitus and deafness. The entity is, however, more nebulous than most discussions indicate.

This disorder occurs mainly in young to middle-aged adults (children and older individuals also may be affected), without preference for either sex. The patient frequently gives a history of an antecedent upper respiratory infection of nonspecific type, but it is not clear whether this is requisite for the diagnosis. Usually, the onset of vertigo is fairly abrupt, although some patients describe a prodromal period of several hours or days in which they felt “top-heavy” or “off balance.” Persistence of the symptoms for a day or more differentiates the process from Ménière disease. The vertigo is severe as a rule and is associated with nausea, vomiting, and the need to remain immobile.

document (3) 

STRESS DISORDERS Clinical Manifestations Patients may develop anxiety after exposure to extreme traumatic events such as the threat of personal death or injury or the death of a loved one. The reaction may occur shortly after the trauma (acute stress disorder) or be delayed and subject to recurrence (PTSD) (Table 466-6). In both syndromes, individuals experience associated symptoms of detachment and loss of emotional responsivity. The patient may feel depersonalized and unable to recall specific aspects of the trauma, although typically it is reexperienced through intrusions in thought, dreams, or flashbacks, particularly when cues of the original event are present. Patients often actively avoid stimuli that precipitate recollections of the trauma and demonstrate a resulting increase in vigilance, arousal, and startle response. Patients with stress disorders are at risk for the development of other disorders related to anxiety, mood, and substance abuse (especially alcohol). Between 5 and 10% of Americans will at some time in their life satisfy criteria for PTSD, with women more likely to be affected than men.

Risk factors for the development of PTSD include a past psychiatric history and personality characteristics of high neuroticism and extroversion. Twin studies show a substantial genetic influence on all symptoms associated with PTSD, with less evidence for an environmental effect.

Etiology and Pathophysiology It is hypothesized that in PTSD there is excessive release of norepinephrine from the locus coeruleus in response to stress and increased noradrenergic activity at projection sites in the hippocampus and amygdala. These changes theoretically facilitate the encoding of fear-based memories. Greater sympathetic responses to cues associated with the traumatic event occur in PTSD, although pituitary adrenal responses are blunted.

Psychiatric diseases may mimic dementia. Severely depressed or anxious individuals may appear demented, a phenomenon sometimes called pseudodementia. Memory and language are usually intact when carefully tested, and a significant memory disturbance usually suggests an underlying dementia, even if the patient is depressed. Patients in this condition may feel confused and unable to accomplish routine tasks. Vegetative symptoms, such as insomnia, lack of energy, poor appetite, and concern with bowel function, are common. Onset is often more abrupt, and the psychosocial milieu may suggest prominent reasons for depression. Such patients respond to treatment of the underlying psychiatric illness. Schizophrenia is usually not difficult to distinguish from dementia, but occasionally the distinction can be problematic. Schizophrenia generally has a much earlier age of onset (second and third decades) than most dementing illnesses and is associated with intact memory. The delusions and hallucinations of schizophrenia are usually more complex, bizarre, and threatening than those of dementia. Some chronic schizophrenics develop an unexplained progressive dementia late in life that is not related to AD. Conversely, FTD, HD, vascular dementia, DLB, AD, or leukoencephalopathy can begin with schizophrenia-like features, leading to the misdiagnosis of a psychiatric condition. Later age of onset, significant deficits on cognitive testing, or the presence of abnormal neuroimaging suggest a degenerative condition. Memory loss may also be part of a conversion disorder. In this situation, patients commonly complain bitterly of memory loss, but careful cognitive testing either does not confirm the deficits or demonstrates inconsistent or unusual patterns of cognitive problems. The patient’s behavior and “wrong” answers to questions often indicate that he or she understands the question and knows the correct answer.

Clouding of cognition by chronic drug or medication use, often prescribed by physicians, is an important cause of dementia. Sedatives, tranquilizers, and analgesics used to treat insomnia, pain, anxiety, or agitation may cause confusion, memory loss, and lethargy, especially in the elderly. Discontinuation of the offending medication often improves mentation.

Some individuals with psychosis may lack insight or awareness of their disorder (i.e., anosognosia). This lack of ”insight" includes unawareness of symptoms of schizophrenia and may be present throughout the entire course of the illness. Unawareness of illness is typically a symptom of schizophrenia itself rather than a coping strategy. It is comparable to the lack of awareness of neurological deficits following brain damage, termed anosa— gnosia. This symptom is the most common predictor of non-adherence to treatment, and it predicts higher relapse rates, increased number of involuntary treatments, poorer psycho- social functioning, aggression, and a poorer course of illness.

Hostility and aggression can be associated with schizophrenia, although spontaneous or random assault is uncommon. Aggression is more frequent for younger males and for individuals with a past history of violence, non-adherence with treatment, substance abuse, and impulsivity. It should be noted that the vast majority of persons with schizo- phrenia are not aggressive and are more frequently victimized than are individuals in the general population.

Currently, there are no radiological, laboratory, or psychometric tests for the disorder.

Differences are evident in multiple brain regions between groups of healthy individuals and persons with schizophrenia, including evidence from neuroimaging, neuropatholog- ical, and neurophysiological studies. Differences are also evident in cellular architecture,

White matter connectivity, and gray matter volume in a variety of regions such as the pre- frontal and temporal cortices. Reduced overall brain volume has been observed, as well as increased brain volume reduction with age. Brain volume reductions with age are more pronounced in individuals with schizophrenia than in healthy individuals. Finally, indi- viduals with schizophrenia appear to differ from individuals without the disorder in eye- tracking and electrophysiological indices.

Neurological soft signs common in individuals with schizophrenia include impairments in motor coordination, sensory integration, and motor sequencing of complex movements; left-right confusion; and disinhibition of associated movements. In addition, minor phys- ical anomalies of the face and limbs may occur.

This disorder occurs mainly in young to middle-aged adults (children and older individuals also may be affected), without preference for either sex. The patient frequently gives a history of an antecedent upper respiratory infection of nonspecific type, but it is not clear whether this is requisite for the diagnosis. Usually, the onset of vertigo is fairly abrupt, although some patients describe a prodromal period of several hours or days in which they felt “top-heavy” or “off balance.” Persistence of the symptoms for a day or more differentiates the process from Ménière disease. The vertigo is severe as a rule and is associated with nausea, vomiting, and the need to remain immobile.

sought medical advice soon after the appearance of the initial symptom, some later, after other symptoms had occurred. One-third of the patients were troubled by vertigo associated with nausea, vomiting, and pressure in the ear. The vertiginous symptoms differed from those of Ménière disease in that discrete attacks separated by periods of normalcy were rare. The vertigo coincided more or less with hearing loss and tinnitus (most often a unilateral high-pitched ringing, sometimes a machinery-like roaring or hissing sound, like that of a steam kettle). Some of our patients ignored their deafness for many months or

The antibody response depends on the dose of immunizing antigen, so hemolytic disease develops only when the mother has experienced a significant transplacental bleed (more than 1 mL of Rh-positive red cells).

The isotype of the antibody is important, because immunoglobulin G (IgG) (but not IgM) antibodies can cross the placenta. The initial exposure to Rh antigen evokes the formation of IgM antibodies, so Rh disease is very uncommon with the first pregnancy. Subsequent exposure during the second or third pregnancy generally leads to a brisk IgG antibody response.

Appreciation of the role of previous sensitization in the pathogenesis of Rh-hemolytic disease of the newborn has led to its therapeutic control. Currently, Rh-negative mothers are given Rh immune globulin (RhIg) at 28 weeks and within 72 hours after delivery of an Rh-positive baby. The RhIg masks the antigenic sites on the fetal red cells that may have leaked into the maternal circulation during childbirth, thus preventing long-lasting sensitization to Rh antigens.

As a result of the remarkable success achieved in prevention of Rh hemolysis, fetomaternal ABO incompatibility currently is the most common cause of immune hemolytic disease of the newborn. Although ABO incompatibility occurs in approximately 20% to 25% of pregnancies, hemolysis develops in only a small fraction of infants born subsequently, and in general the disease is much milder than Rh incompatibility. In part the less severe course of disease can be attributed to the expression of A and B antigens on many cells other than red cells which act like sponge for the transferred antibody. ABO hemolytic disease occurs almost exclusively in infants of blood group A or B who are born to mothers of blood group O. The normal anti-A and anti-B isohemagglutinins in group O mothers usually are of the IgM type and therefore do not cross the placenta. However, for reasons not well understood, certain group O women possess IgG antibodies directed against group A or B antigens (or both) even without previous sensitization. Therefore, the firstborn may be affected. There is no effective method of preventing hemolytic disease resulting from ABO incompatibility.

Rh incompatibility may induce a hemolytic transfusion reaction and in newborns causes the hemolytic disease erythroblastosis fetalis. Erythroblastosis fetalis occurs in Rh(D) newborns delivered by Rh(D ) mothers and results from an immune reaction of anti-D immunoglobulins passed across the placenta from the mother. The anti-D antibodies are produced by the mother in response to the D antigen expressed on the fetal erythrocytes that leak into her circulation during pregnancy. Administration of anti-D antibodies (RhoGAM) to the mother during pregnancy and after parturition destroys any circulating Rh(D) fetal erythrocytes that persist in the mother’s blood, thus preventing Rh-incompatibility reactions in future pregnancies.

Hemoglobin consists of four polypeptide chains of globin ,  , ,and , each complexed to an iron-containing heme group (Fig. 10.4). The structure of the polypeptide chains varies. Depending on the particular polypeptides present, the following types of hemoglobin can be distinguished:  Hemoglobin HbA is most prevalent in adults, accounting for about 96% of total hemoglobin. It is a tetramer with two  and two  chains (2 2).

 Hemoglobin HbA2 accounts for 1.5% to 3% of total hemoglobin in adults. It consists of two  and two  chains (22).

 Hemoglobin HbF accounts for less than 1% of total hemoglobin in adults. It contains two  and two  chains (22) and is the principal form of hemoglobin in the fetus.

Hemagglutination is used to determine the ABO blood group of blood donors and transfusion recipients. Clumping or agglutination is induced by antibodies or agglutinins called anti-A or anti-B that bind to the A or B blood-group substances, respectively (Fig. A.7). These blood-group antigens are arrayed in many copies on the surface of the red blood cell, causing the cells to agglutinate when cross-linked by antibodies. Because hemagglutination involves the cross-linking of blood cells by the simultaneous binding of antibody molecules to identical antigens on different cells, this reaction also demonstrates that each antibody molecule must have at least two identical antigen-binding sites.

A-6 Coombs tests and the detection of rhesus incompatibility.

Coombs tests use anti-immunoglobulin antibodies to detect the antibodies that cause hemolytic disease of the newborn, or erythroblastosis fetalis. Anti-immunoglobulin antibodies were first developed by Robin Coombs, and the test for this disease is still called the Coombs test. Hemolytic disease of the newborn occurs when a mother makes IgG antibodies specific for the rhesus or Rh bloodgroup antigen expressed on the red blood cells of her fetus. Rh-negative mothers make these antibodies when they are exposed at delivery to Rh-positive fetal red blood cells bearing the paternally inherited Rh antigen. During subsequent pregnancies, these antibodies are transported across the placenta to the fetus. This normal process is generally beneficial, as it protects newborn infants against infection. However, IgG anti-Rh antibodies coat the fetal red blood cells, which are then destroyed by phagocytic cells in the liver, causing a hemolytic anemia in the fetus and newborn infant.

Cerebellar Gait (See Also Chap. 5)

The main features are a wide base (separation of legs), unsteadiness, irregularity of steps, and lateral veering. Steps are uncertain, some are shorter and others longer than intended and the patient may compensate for these abnormalities by shortening his steps or even keeping both feet on the ground simultaneously. Cerebellar gait is sometimes referred to as “reeling” or “drunken,” but these terms are not entirely correct and are characteristic instead of intoxication and of certain types of labyrinthine disease, as explained further on.

With cerebellar ataxia, the unsteadiness and irregular swaying of the trunk are prominent when the patient arises from a chair or turns suddenly while walking and may be evident when he has to stop walking abruptly and sit down; it may be necessary to grasp the chair for support. Cerebellar ataxia may be so severe that the patient cannot sit without swaying. If it is less severe, standing with feet together and head erect is difficult with open eyes and only slightly more so with eyes closed. In its mildest form, ataxia is best demonstrated by having the patient walk a line heel to toe; after a step or two, he loses his balance and finds it necessary to place one foot to the side to avoid falling. Elderly individuals may be expected to have difficulty with the task.

Gait varies considerably from one to another and it is a commonplace observation that a person may be identified by the sound of his footsteps, notably the pace and the lightness or heaviness of tread, by their carriage at a distance, even before the person is recognizable by face. Obviously, the gaits of men and women differ, a woman’s steps being quicker and shorter. Sherlock Holmes expressed pride in his talent for deducing from the manner of gait, an individual’s personality and occupation. It is said that Charcot could often make the correct diagnosis, even before seeing the patient, based on the sound of patient walking down the hallway on the way to the examining room. The changes in stance and gait that accompany aging—the slightly stooped posture and slow, stiff tread as described in Chap. 28, on aging—are so familiar that they are not perceived as abnormalities.

The normal gait seldom attracts attention but it should be observed with care if slight deviations from normal are to be appreciated. The body is erect, the head is straight, and the arms hang loosely and gracefully at the sides, each moving rhythmically forward with the opposite leg. The feet are slightly externally rotated, the steps are approximately equal, and the medial malleoli almost touch as each foot passes the other. The medial edges of the heels, as they strike the ground with each step, lie almost along a straight line. As each leg moves forward, there is coordinated flexion of the hip and knee, dorsiflexion of the foot, and a barely perceptible elevation of the hip, so that the foot clears the ground. Also, with each step, the thorax advances slightly on the side opposite the swinging lower limb. The heel strikes the ground first, and inspection of the shoes will show that this part is most subject to wear.

Gait Disorder of Vestibulopathy

Patients with a chronic vestibulopathy show unsteadiness in standing and walking, often without widening their base, and an inability to descend stairs without holding onto the banister. They complain of a particular type of imbalance, usually with movement but at times when standing still—a sensation that may be likened to being on the deck of a rolling ship (mal de barquement). Running and turning quickly are even more impaired, with lurching in all directions. The patient has great difficulty in focusing his vision on a fixed target when he is moving or on a moving target when he is either stationary or moving. When the body is in motion or the head is moved suddenly, objects in the environment may appear momentarily blurred or actually jiggle up and down or from side to side (oscillopsia). Driving a car or reading on a train is difficult or impossible; even when walking, the patient may need to stop in order to read a sign. These abnormalities indicate a loss of stabilization of ocular fixation by the vestibular system during body movements (the vestibular-ocular reflex, or VOR). An elderly person has difficulty compensating for these abnormalities. Proof that the gait of such persons with vestibulopathy is dependent on visual clues comes from their performance blindfolded or in the dark, when their unsteadiness and staggering increase to the point of falling. When standing with eyes closed, they sway more than normal but generally do not fall over (i.e., they do not have a Romberg sign). The diagnosis is confirmed by testing labyrinthine function (caloric and rotational testing, electronystagmography, and posture platform testing).

Gait Disorder in Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (See Also Chap. 29)

Progressive difficulty in walking is typically the initial and most prominent symptom of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). However, the gait disturbance in NPH has few specific features. Certainly, it cannot be categorized as ataxic or spastic or what has been described as “apraxic” gait; nor does it have more than a superficial resemblance to parkinsonian gait. Its main early features—slowness in lifting the feet from the floor (called in some texts “magnetic gait”), reduced cadence, widened base, and short steps—may be misconstrued as compensations observed in patients with all manner of gait disorders. Patients with the gait disorder of NPH may complain of a sense of imbalance or vague dizziness, but most have difficulty in articulating the exact problem.

Like patients with disorders of frontal lobe function, they are better able to carry out the motions of stepping and cycling with the legs while supine or sitting but have difficulty in taking steps when upright or attempting to walk. They are helped by marching to a cadence or in step with the examiner, and by maintaining contact with the arm of another person. Turning may be impeded, performed in multiple steps, and have the appearance of a foot remaining stuck to the ground. If observed getting on and off an examining table and in and out of bed, they display poor management of the entire axial musculature, moving their bodies without shifting the center of gravity (en bloc turning) or adjusting their limbs appropriately. Changes in posture, even rolling over in bed, are made en bloc. The erect posture is assumed in an awkward manner—with hips and knees only slightly flexed and stiff and a delay in swinging the legs over the side of the bed.

A detailed history is very diagnostic but the use of a couple simple tests can help to confirm it (63). The most common one is the Phalen maneuver, in which the patient ﬂexes her palms at the wrist as close to 90 degrees as possible. Then with the dorsal portion of the hands touching and the arms parallel to the ﬂoor, the patient presses the ﬂexed hands against each other for approximately 1 minute. This should reproduce her symptoms along the median nerve. The Tinel test involves percussion over the top of the carpal tunnel where the median nerve travels. A positive test is when the percussion reproduces the pain and paresthesia. Additional testing such as nerve conduction studies should be reserved for patients who do not respond to conservative management or have significant muscle weakness.

Treatment involves lifestyle modification to decrease repetitive motion injuries or prolonged marked ﬂexion at the wrist. A carpal tunnel brace can be very helpful in maintaining adequate extension at the wrist, thereby “opening” the tunnel and reducing compression on the medial nerve. Only if these strategies do not work is a surgical intervention indicated.

With the patient in the supine position (see Fig. 17-18C) the clinician gently palpates the breasts, making certain to examine all quadrants of the breast from the sternum laterally to the latissimus dorsi muscle and from the clavicle inferiorly to the upper rectus sheath. The examination is per-formed with the palmar aspects of the fingers, avoiding a grasp-ing or pinching motion. The breast may be cupped or molded in the examiner’s hands to check for retraction.

Patients may tear the supraspinatus tendon acutely by falling on an outstretched arm or lifting a heavy object. Symptoms are pain along with weakness of abduction and external rotation of the shoulder. Atrophy of the supraspinatus muscles develops. The diagnosis is establishedbyarthrogram,ultrasound,ormagneticresonanceimaging (MRI).Surgicalrepairmaybenecessaryin patientswhofail torespond to conservative measures.

Thisconditionischaracterizedbydepositionofcalciumsalts,primarily hydroxyapatite, within a tendon. The exact mechanism of calcification is not known but may be initiated by ischemia or degeneration of the tendon. The supraspinatus tendon is most often affected because it is frequently impinged on and has a reduced blood supply when the arm is abducted. The condition usually develops after age 40. Calcification within the tendon may evoke acute inflammation, producing sudden and severe pain in the shoulder. However, it may be asymptomatic or not related to the patient’s symptoms. Diagnosis of calcific tendonitis can be made by ultrasound or radiograph. Most cases are self-limited and respond to conservative therapy with physical therapy and/or NSAIDs. A subset of patients is refractory and requires ultrasound-guided percutaneous needle aspiration and lavage or surgery.

With regard to symptomatic treatment, an attempt can be made to reduce spasticity with medications, such as baclofen or tizanidine, or by subarachnoid infusions of baclofen via an implanted lumbar pump. Initial intrathecal test doses are given to predict a response to the pump infusions of baclofen, but this test may fail; consequently, in severe cases it may be advisable to proceed with a constant infusion for several days. Some degree of improved comfort from a reduction in the extreme rigidity is usually the most that can be expected. Partial relief from spasticity may also be afforded by the use of benzodiazepines or sometimes dantrolene. These approaches are most suitable for cases of primary lateral sclerosis, which can be expected to progress slowly and for a long period. The pseudobulbar syndrome can be ameliorated with dextromethorphan-quinidine compounds.

At all stages of ALS, physical therapy is useful in maintaining mobility, but overwork of the muscles leading to fatigue and cramps should be avoided. Physical therapy is invaluable, for example, for avoiding contractures of the fingers and shoulders. Occupational therapy is likewise helpful, particularly assessments of the patient’s function in the home.

After initial stimulation by hypothermia, there is progressive depression of all organ systems. The timing of the appearance of these clinical manifestations varies widely (Table 478e-2). Without knowing the core temperature, it can be difficult to interpret other vital signs. For example, tachycardia disproportionate to the core temperature suggests secondary hypothermia resulting from hypoglycemia, hypovolemia, or a toxin overdose. Because carbon dioxide production declines progressively, the respiratory rate should be low; persistent hyperventilation suggests a central nervous system (CNS) lesion or one of the organic acidoses. A markedly depressed level of consciousness in a patient with mild hypothermia raises suspicion of an overdose or CNS dysfunction due to infection or trauma.

Physical examination findings can also be altered by hypothermia. For instance, the assumption that areflexia is solely attributable to hypothermia can obscure and delay the diagnosis of a spinal cord lesion. Patients with hypothermia may be confused or combative; these symptoms abate more rapidly with rewarming than with chemical or physical restraint. A classic example of maladaptive behavior in patients with hypothermia is paradoxical undressing, which involves the inappropriate removal of clothing in response to a cold stress. The cold-induced ileus and abdominal rectus spasm can mimic or mask the presentation of an acute abdomen (Chap. 20).

Some patients with heat exhaustion develop heatstroke after removal from the heat-stress environment. Aggressive cooling of non-responders is indicated until their core temperature is 39°C (102.2°F). Except in mild cases, free water deficits should be replaced slowly over 24–48 h to avoid a decrease of serum osmolality by >2 mOsm/h.

The disposition of younger, previously healthy heat-exhaustion patients who have no major laboratory abnormalities may include hospital observation and discharge after IV rehydration. Older patients with comorbidities (including cardiovascular disease) or predisposing factors often require inpatient fluid and electrolyte replacement, monitoring, and reassessment.

The clinical manifestations of heatstroke reflect a total loss of thermo-regulatory function. Typical vital-sign abnormalities include tachypnea, various tachycardias, hypotension, and a widened pulse pressure. Although there is no single specific diagnostic test, the historical and physical triad of exposure to a heat stress, CNS dysfunction, and a core temperature >40.5°C helps establish the preliminary diagnosis.

The definitive diagnosis should be reserved until the other potential causes of hyperthermia are excluded. Many of the usual laboratory abnormalities seen with heatstroke overlap with other conditions. If the patient's mental status does not improve with cooling, toxicologic screening may be indicated, and cranial CT and spinal fluid analysis can be considered.

The premonitory clinical characteristics may be nonspecific and include weakness, dizziness, disorientation, ataxia, and gastrointestinal or psychiatric symptoms. These prodromal symptoms often resemble heat exhaustion. The sudden onset of heatstroke occurs when the maintenance of adequate perfusion requires peripheral vasoconstriction to stabilize the mean arterial blood pressure. As a result, the cutaneous radiation of heat ceases. At this juncture, the core temperature rises dramatically. Since many patients with heatstroke also meet the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome and have a broad differential diagnosis, rapid cooling is essential during the extensive diagnostic evaluation (Table 479e-1).

Mild hypovolemia (≤20% of the blood volume) generates mild tachycardia but relatively few external signs, especially in a supine young patient (Table 324-5). With moderate hypovolemia (~20–40% of the blood volume), the patient becomes increasingly anxious and tachycardic; although normal blood pressure may be maintained in the supine position, there may be significant postural hypotension and tachycardia. If hypovolemia is severe (≥40% of the blood volume), the classic signs of shock appear; the blood pressure declines and becomes unstable even in the supine position, and the patient develops marked tachycardia, oliguria, and agitation or confusion. Perfusion of the central nervous system is well maintained until shock becomes severe. Hence, mental obtundation is an ominous clinical sign. The transition from mild to severe hypovolemic shock can be insidious or extremely rapid. If severe shock is not reversed rapidly, especially in elderly patients and those with comorbid illnesses, death is imminent. A very narrow time frame separates the derangements found in severe shock that can be reversed with aggressive resuscitation from those of progressive decompensation and irreversible cell injury.

Diagnosis Hypovolemic shock is readily diagnosed when there are signs of hemodynamic instability and the source of volume loss is obvious. The diagnosis is more difficult when the source of blood loss is occult, as into the GI tract, or when plasma volume alone is depleted. Even after acute hemorrhage, hemoglobin and hematocrit values do not change until compensatory fluid shifts have occurred or exogenous fluid is administered. Thus, an initial normal hematocrit does not disprove the presence of significant blood loss. Plasma losses cause hemoconcentration, and free water loss leads to hypernatremia. These findings should suggest the presence of hypovolemia.

Inspection and Palpation In patients with severe MS, there may be a malar flush with pinched and blue facies. In patients with sinus rhythm and severe pulmonary hypertension or associated tricuspid stenosis (TS), the jugular venous pulse reveals prominent a waves due to vigorous right atrial systole. The systemic arterial pressure is usually normal or slightly low. An RV tap along the left sternal border signifies an enlarged RV. A diastolic thrill may rarely be present at the cardiac apex, with the patient in the left lateral recumbent position.

Auscultation The first heart sound (S1) is usually accentuated in the early stages of the disease and slightly delayed. The pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P2) also is often accentuated with elevated PA pressures, and the two components of the second heart sound (S2) are closely split. The opening snap (OS) of the mitral valve is most readily audible in expiration at, or just medial to, the cardiac apex. This sound generally follows the sound of aortic valve closure (A2) by 0.05–0.12 s. The time interval between A2 and OS varies inversely with the severity of the MS. The OS is followed by a low-pitched, rumbling, diastolic murmur, heard best at the apex with the patient in the left lateral recumbent position (see Fig. 267-5); it is accentuated by mild exercise (e.g., a few rapid sit-ups) carried out just before auscultation. In general, the duration of this murmur correlates with the severity of the stenosis in patients with preserved CO. In patients with sinus rhythm, the murmur often reappears or becomes louder during atrial systole (presystolic accentuation). Soft, grade I or II/VI systolic murmurs are commonly heard at the apex or along the left sternal border in patients with pure MS and do not necessarily signify the presence of MR. Hepatomegaly, ankle edema, ascites, and pleural effusion, particularly in the right pleural cavity, may occur in patients with MS and RV failure.

Associated Lesions With severe pulmonary hypertension, a pansystolic murmur produced by functional TR may be audible along the left sternal border. This murmur is usually louder during inspiration and diminishes during forced expiration (Carvallo’s sign). When the CO is markedly reduced in MS, the typical auscultatory findings, including the diastolic rumbling murmur, may not be detectable (silent MS), but they may reappear as compensation is restored. The Graham Steell murmur of PR, a high-pitched, diastolic, decrescendo blowing murmur along the left sternal border, results from dilation of the pulmonary valve ring and occurs in patients with mitral valve disease and severe pulmonary hypertension. This murmur may be indistinguishable from the more common murmur produced by aortic regurgitation (AR), although it may increase in intensity with inspiration and is accompanied by a loud and often palpable P2.

LABORATORY EXAMINATION ECG In MS and sinus rhythm, the P wave usually suggests LA enlargement (see Fig. 268-8). It may become tall and peaked in lead II and upright in lead V1 when severe pulmonary hypertension or TS complicates MS and right atrial (RA) enlargement occurs. The QRS complex is usually normal. However, with severe pulmonary hypertension, right axis deviation and RV hypertrophy are often present.

document (2) 

Diastolic Murmurs In contrast to some systolic murmurs, diastolic heart murmurs always signify structural heart disease (Fig. 267-5). The murmur associated with acute, severe AR is relatively soft and of short duration because of the rapid rise in LV diastolic pressure and the progressive diminution of the aortic-LV diastolic pressure gradient. In contrast, the murmur of chronic severe AR is classically heard as a decrescendo, blowing diastolic murmur along the left sternal border in patients with primary valve pathology and sometimes along the right sternal border in patients with primary aortic root pathology.

With chronic AR, the pulse pressure is wide 1449 and the arterial pulses are bounding in character. These signs of significant diastolic run-off are absent in the acute phase. The murmur of pulmonic regurgitation is also heard along the left sternal border. It is most commonly due to pulmonary hypertension and enlargement of the annulus of the pulmonic valve. S2 is single and loud and may be palpable. There is a right ventricular/parasternal lift that is indicative of chronic right ventricular pressure overload. A less impressive murmur of PR is present after repair of tetralogy of Fallot or pulmonic valve atresia. In this postoperative setting, the murmur is softer and lower-pitched, and the severity of the accompanying pulmonic regurgitation can be underestimated significantly.

document (3) 

Mid-Diastolic Murmurs (Figs. 51e-1G and 51e-1H) Mid-diastolic murmurs result from obstruction and/or augmented flow at the level of the mitral or tricuspid valve. Rheumatic fever is the most common cause of MS (Fig. 51e-6). In younger patients with pliable valves, S1 is loud and the murmur begins after an opening snap, which is a high-pitched sound that occurs shortly after S2. The interval between the pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P2) and the opening snap is inversely related to the magnitude of the left atrial–left ventricular pressure gradient. The murmur of MS is low-pitched and thus is best heard with the bell of the stethoscope. It is loudest at the left ventricular apex and often is appreciated only when the patient is turned in the left lateral decubitus position. It is usually of grade 1 or 2 intensity but may be absent when the cardiac output is severely reduced despite significant obstruction. The intensity of the murmur increases during maneuvers that increase cardiac output and mitral valve flow, such as exercise. The duration of the murmur reflects the length of time over which left atrial pressure exceeds left ventricular diastolic pressure. An increase in the intensity of the murmur just before S1, a phenomenon known as presystolic accentuation (Figs. 51e-1A and 51e-6), occurs in patients in sinus rhythm and is due to a late increase in transmitral flow with atrial contraction. Presystolic accentuation does not occur in patients with atrial fibrillation.

The mid-diastolic murmur associated with tricuspid stenosis is best heard at the lower left sternal border and increases in intensity with inspiration. A prolonged y descent may be visible in the jugular venous waveform. This murmur is very difficult to hear and often is obscured by left-sided acoustical events.

the pressure gradient between the abdomen and chest enlarges the hiatal hernia. In many cases the type 1 sliding hernia will evolve into a type III mixed hernia. Type II hernias are quite rare. The age distribution of patients with PEHs is significantly different from that observed in sliding hiatal hernias. The median age of the former is 61 years old; of the latter, 48 years old.

Hernia Repair.  Controversy remains as to whether to perform an antireflux procedure at all, in selected cases only, or in all patients. Most advocate the routine addition of an antireflux procedure follow-ing repair of the hernia defect. There are several reasons for this. Physiologic testing with 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring has shown increased esophageal exposure to acid gastric juice in 60% to 70% of patients with a paraesophageal hiatal hernia, nearly identical to the observed 71% incidence in patients with a sliding hiatal hernia.

Attention should be focused on the position of the GEJ, when seen, to differentiate it from a type II hernia (see Fig. 25-39B and C). Fiber-optic esophagos-copy is useful in the diagnosis and classification of a hiatal hernia because the scope can be retroflexed.

The age of onset is usually between 15 and 50 years. Blacks, whites, and Asians are equally affected. The dominant nature of the inheritance of von Hippel-Lindau disease is well known. Seizinger and coworkers, in cases associated with renal cell carcinoma and pheochromocytoma, localized a defect in a tumor suppressor gene (termed VHL; see Chap. 37).

The diagnosis can be deduced from the appearance on CT or MRI of a cerebellar cyst containing an enhancing nodular lesion on its wall. Often, the associated retinal hemangioma will be disclosed by the same imaging procedure. The angiographic picture is also characteristic: a cluster of small vessels forming a mass 1.0 to 2.0 cm in diameter (Fig. 30-14). Craniotomy with opening of the cerebellar cyst and excision of the mural hemangioblastomatous nodule is usually curative, but there is a high rate of recurrence if the entire tumor, including the nodule, is not completely removed. In the series of Boughey and colleagues, the lesion was successfully excised in 80 percent of patients; 15 percent of patients, who had only partial resection of an isolated cerebellar lesion, developed recurrent tumors. More recently, several groups have used endovascular embolization of the vascular nodule prior to surgery, but it is not clear if this reduces the incidence of recurrence. Treatment with focused radiation is also being undertaken, particularly for multifocal or surgically inaccessible lesions, and several case series using either stereotactic radiosurgery, or external or proton beam radiation indicate results that may be comparable to conventional treatment.

A solitary pulmonary nodule is defined as an x-ray density completely surrounded by normal aerated lung with circumscribed margins, of any shape, usually 1–6 cm in greatest diameter. The approach to a patient with a solitary pulmonary nodule is based on an estimate of the probability of cancer, determined according to the patient’s smoking history, age, and characteristics on imaging (Table 107-9). Prior CXRs and CT scans should be obtained if available for comparison. A PET scan may be useful if the lesion is greater than 7–8 mm in diameter. If no diagnosis is apparent, Mayo

diagnosis is apparent, Mayo investigators reported that clinical characteristics (age, cigarette smoking status, and prior cancer diagnosis) and three radiologic characteristics (nodule diameter, spiculation, and upper lobe location) were independent predictors of malignancy. At present, only two radiographic criteria are thought to predict the benign nature of a solitary pulmonary nodule: lack of growth over a period >2 years and certain characteristic patterns of calcification. Calcification alone, however, does not exclude malignancy; a dense central nidus, multiple punctuate foci, and “bulls eye” (granuloma) and “popcorn ball” (hamartoma) calcifications are highly suggestive

are highly suggestive of a benign lesion. In contrast, a relatively large lesion, lack of or asymmetric calcification, chest symptoms, associated atelectasis, pneumonitis, or growth of the lesion revealed by comparison with an old x-ray or CT scan or a positive PET scan may be suggestive of a malignant process and warrant further attempts to establish a histologic diagnosis. An algorithm for assessing these lesions is shown in Fig. 107-6.

Occurring in 1 in 500 male births, KS is the most commongenetic cause of hypogonadism and infertility in men. It is causedby the presence of an extra X chromosome (47,XXY) (see Chapter 174). The extra X chromosome arises from a nondisjunctionin either the sperm or the egg. About 15% of boys with featuresof KS are found to be mosaic, with 46,XY/47,XXY mosaicismbeing the most common. Before puberty, boys with KS are phenotypically indistinguishable from the rest of the population.

The diagnosis is often made when the boy is 15 or 16 years ofage. At that point, the finding of the progressive developmentof pubic and axillary hair in the presence of testes that remaininfantile in volume should alert the clinician to the disorder. Adolescents and young adults with KS tend to be tall, with longlimbs. During adolescence or adulthood, gynecomastia occurs.

Because of failure of growth and maturation of the testes, males with KS have testosterone deficiency and failure to produce viable sperm. Low production of testicular testosterone results in failure to develop later secondary sexual characteristics, such as facial hair, deepening of the voice, and libido. In adulthood, osteopenia and osteoporosis develop. Because of these findings, testosterone supplementation is indicated.

Most men with KS are infertile because they produce few viable sperm. Through the use of isolation of viable sperm through testicular biopsy, coupled with in vitro fertilization and intracytoplasmic sperm injection, it is possible for men with KS to father children; all children born to these men using this technology have had a normal chromosome complement.

If abnormalities in the semen are detected, further evaluation of the male partner by a urologist is indicated to diagnose the defect. Table 32.4 lists the differential diagnoses for male factor infertility (53). Several groups have attempted to assess the distribution of male infertility diagnoses; two such distributions are shown in Table 32.5 (54,55). The first is the result of a WHO study of 7,057 men with complete diagnoses based on the WHO standard investigation of the infertile couple (54). The figures include data from cases in which the male partner was normal and the presumed cause of the couple’s infertility was a female factor. The second distribution is the result of a study of 425 subfertile male patients (54). Although the two studies represent different populations (one is from a study of couples, the other from a urologic practice) and differ in their distribution of male infertility diagnoses, idiopathic male factor and varicocele predominate. Other anatomic and endocrine causes occur less frequently. Same sex female couples or single women without a male partner who desire pregnancy may be considered as part of this category.

Endometriosis Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial glands or stroma outside the endometrial cavity and uterine musculature and accounts for 40% of infertility not due to ovulatory disorders, tubal obstruction, or male factor. Its presence is suggested by a history of dyspareunia (painful intercourse), worsening dysmenorrhea that often begins before menses, or a thickened rectovaginal septum or deviation of the cervix on pelvic examination. Mild endometriosis does not appear to impair fertility; the pathogenesis of the infertility associated with moderate and severe endometriosis may be multifactorial with impairments of folliculogenesis, fertilization, and implantation, as well as adhesions. Endometriosis is often clinically silent, however, and can only be excluded definitively by laparoscopy.

MALE CAUSES (SEE ALSO CHAP. 411)

Known causes of male infertility include primary testicular disease, genetic disorders (particularly Y chromosome microdeletions), disorders of sperm transport, and hypothalamic-pituitary disease resulting in secondary hypogonadism. However, the etiology is not ascertained in up to one-half of men with suspected male factor infertility. The key initial diagnostic test is a semen analysis. Testosterone levels should be measured if the sperm count is low on repeated examination or if there is clinical evidence of hypogonadism. Gonadotropin levels will help to determine a gonadal versus a central cause of hypogonadism.

excess results from an increase in the secretion of estradiol by the testicles or by nontesticular tumors, nutri-tional alterations such as protein and fat deprivation, endocrine disorders (hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism), and hepatic dis-ease (nonalcoholic and alcoholic cirrhosis). Refeeding gyne-comastia is related to the resumption of pituitary gonadotropin secretion after pituitary shutdown. Androgen deficiency may initiate gynecomastia. Concurrently occurring with decreased circulating testosterone levels is an elevated level of circulating testosterone-binding globulin, which results in a reduction of free testosterone. This senescent gynecomastia usually occurs in men age 50

Child abuse must always be considered in the differential diagnosis of a child with fractures, especially in those younger than 3 years (see Chapter 22). Common fracture patterns that should increase the index of suspicion include multiple fractures in different stages of radiographic healing, metaphyseal corner fractures (shaking), fractures too severe for the history, or fractures in nonambulatory infants. Although spiral fractures of long bones were historically considered pathognomic for abuse, they can be seen in nonabuse situations.

When there is concern for child abuse, the child should have a full evaluation, which may include admission to the hospital. A thorough and well-documented physical examination should focus on soft tissue injuries, the cranium, and a funduscopic examination for retinal hemorrhages or detachment. A skeletal survey or a bone scan may be helpful in identifying other fractures.

The hip is a ball (femoral head) and socket (acetabulum) joint that is important for skeletal stability. The femoral head and acetabulum are interdependent for normal growth and development. The femoral neck and head, which contain the capital femoral epiphysis, are intra-articular. The blood supply to this region is unique because the blood vessels are extraosseous and lie on the surface of the femoral neck, entering the epiphysis peripherally. Thus, the blood supply to the femoral head is vulnerable to trauma, infection, and other causes that may increase intra-articular pressure. Damage to the blood supply can lead to avascular necrosis.

The physical abuse of children by parents affects children of all ages. It is estimated that 1% to 2% of children are physically abused during childhood and that approximately 1500 children are fatally injured each year. Although mothers are most frequently reported as the perpetrators of physical abuse, serious injuries, such as head or abdominal trauma, are more likely to be inflicted by fathers or maternal boyfriends. The diagnosis of physical abuse can be made easily if the child is battered, has obvious external injuries, or is capable of providing a history of the abuse. In many cases, the diagnosis is not obvious. The history provided by the parent is often inaccurate because the parent is unwilling to provide the correct history or is a nonoffending parent who is unaware of the abuse. The child may be too young or ill to provide a history of the assault. An older child may be too scared to do so or may have a strong sense of loyalty to the perpetrator.

A diagnosis of physical abuse initially is suggested by a history that seems incongruent with the clinical presentation ofthe child (Table 22-1). Although injury to any organ systemcan occur from physical abuse, some injuries are more common. Bruises are universal findings in healthy ambulatorychildren but also are among the most common injury identified in abused children. Bruises suggestive of abuse includethose that are patterned, such as a slap mark on the face orlooped extension cord marks on the body (Fig. 22-1). Bruises

Asking the patient when the baby first moved and if she is currently experiencing movement of the fetus is important. Determining fetal age is key for consider-ations of viability. Gestational age may be estimated by noting fundal height, with the fundus approximating the umbilicus at 20 weeks and the costal margin at 40 weeks.

a pneumothorax of <15% are admitted for observation, whereas those who have a pneumothorax of >15% or who require positive pressure ventilation undergo tube decompression. Presence of a hemothorax in this age group may be particularly problematic because the child’s chest may contain his or her entire blood volume. If the chest tube output is initially 20% of the patient’s blood volume (80 mL/kg) or is persistently >1 to 2 mL/kg per hour, thoracotomy should be considered. Aortic injuries are rare in children, and tracheobronchial injuries are more amenable to nonoperative management.

On the morning of the test, adults are then given 75 g of glucose in 300 mL of water; children are given 1.75 g of glucose per kilogram of ideal body weight. The glucose load is consumed within 5 minutes. Blood samples for plasma glucose are obtained at 0 and 120 minutes after ingestion of glucose. An oral glucose tolerance test is normal if the fasting venous plasma glucose value is less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) and the 2-hour value falls below 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L). A fasting value of 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher or a 2-hour value of greater than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus. Patients with 2-hour value of 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.1 mmol/L) have impaired glucose tolerance.

B. Hemoglobin A1c Measurements

When plasma glucose levels are in the normal range, about 4–6% of hemoglobin A has one or both of the N terminal valines of their beta chains irreversibly glycated by glucose—referred to as hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). The HbA1c fraction is abnormally elevated in people with diabetes with chronic hyperglycemia. Since red cells have a lifespan of up to 120 days, the HbA1c value reflects plasma glucose levels over the preceding 8–12 weeks. In patients who monitor their glucose levels, the HbA1c value provides a valuable check on the accuracy of their monitoring. In patients who do not monitor their glucose levels, HbA1c measurements are essential for adjusting treatment. HbA1c can be used to diagnose diabetes. An HbA1c of 6.5% or greater if confirmed by repeat testing is diagnostic of diabetes. Less than 5.7% is normal, and patients with levels of 5.7–6.4% are considered at high risk for developing diabetes (Table 41–4).

Erythrocyte transfusion is generally recommended when the blood hemoglobin level decreases to ≤7 g/dL, with a target level of 9 g/dL in adults. Erythropoietin is not used to treat sepsis-related anemia. Bicarbonate is sometimes administered for severe metabolic acidosis (arterial pH <7.2), but there is little evidence that it improves either hemodynamics or the response to vasopressor hormones. DIC, if complicated by major bleeding, should be treated with transfusion of fresh-frozen plasma and platelets. Successful treatment of the underlying infection is essential to reverse both acidosis and DIC. Patients who are hypercatabolic and have acute renal failure may benefit greatly from intermittent hemodialysis or continuous veno-venous hemofiltration.

In patients with prolonged severe sepsis (i.e., that lasting more than 2 or 3 days), nutritional supplementation may reduce the impact of protein hypercatabolism; the available evidence favors the enteral delivery route. Prophylactic heparinization to prevent deep venous thrombosis is indicated for patients who do not have active bleeding or coagulopathy; when heparin is contraindicated, compression 1758 stockings or an intermittent compression device should be used. Recovery is also assisted by prevention of skin breakdown, nosocomial infections, and stress ulcers. The role of tight control of the blood glucose concentration in recovery from critical illness has been addressed in numerous controlled trials. Meta-analyses of these trials have concluded that use of insulin to lower blood glucose levels to 100–120 mg/dL is potentially harmful and does not improve survival rates. Most experts now recommend using insulin only if it is needed to maintain the blood glucose concentration below ~180 mg/dL. Patients receiving intravenous insulin must be monitored frequently (every 1–2 h) for hypoglycemia.

Acute infections are most often subclinical and anicteric.

When they are clinically apparent, nausea and vomiting, headache, and malaise may precede jaundice by 1 to 2 weeks. Lowgrade fever is more common with hepatitis A. By the time jaundice develops, symptoms are usually improving. Serum transaminase levels vary, and their peaks do not correspond with disease severity (see Table 55-1). Peak levels that range from 400 to 4000 U/L are usually reached by the time jaundice develops. Serum bilirubin values typically continue to rise, despite falling serum transaminase levels, and peak at 5 to 20 mgl dL.

Any evidence for severe disease should prompt hospitalization. These include persistent nausea and vomiting, prolonged prothrombin time, low serum albumin level, hypoglycemia, high serum bilirubin level, or central nervous system symptoms. In most cases, however, clinical and biochemical recovery is complete within 1 to 2 months in all cases of hepatitis A, in most cases of hepatitis B, but in only a small proportion of cases of hepatitis C.

When patients are hospitalized, their feces, secretions, bedpans, and other articles in contact with the intestinal tract should be handled with glove-protected hands. Extra precautions, such as double gloving during delivery and surgical procedures, are recommended. Due to significant exposure of health-care personnel to hepatitis B, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2016a) recommend active and passive vaccination, described later. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C, so recommendations are for postexposure serosurveillance only.

Acute hepatitis has a case-fatality rate of 0.1 percent. For patients ill enough to be hospitalized, it may reach 1 percent. Most fatalities are due to fulminant hepatic necrosis, which in later pregnancy may resemble acute fatty liver. In these cases, hepatic encephalopathy is the usual presentation, and the mortality rate is 80 percent. Approximately half of patients with fulminant disease have hepatitis B infection, and co-infection with the delta agent is common.

Bleeding from right colonic vascular ectasias in the elderly may be overt or occult; it tends to be chronic and only occasionally is hemodynamically significant. Endoscopic hemostatic therapy may be useful in the treatment of vascular ectasias, as well as discrete bleeding ulcers and postpolypectomy bleeding. Surgical therapy is generally required for major, persistent, or recurrent bleeding from the wide variety of colonic sources of GIB that cannot be treated medically, angiographically, or endoscopically.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT:

Measurement of the heart rate and blood pressure is the best way to initially assess a patient with GIB. Clinically significant bleeding leads to postural changes in heart rate or blood pressure, tachycardia, and, finally, recumbent hypotension. In contrast, the hemoglobin does not fall immediately with acute GIB, due to proportionate reductions in plasma and red cell volumes (i.e., “people bleed whole blood”). Thus, hemoglobin may be normal or only minimally decreased at the initial presentation of a severe bleeding episode. As extravascular fluid enters the vascular space to restore volume, the hemoglobin falls, but this process may take up to 72 h. Transfusion is recommended when the hemoglobin drops below 7 g/dL, based on a large randomized trial showing this restrictive transfusion strategy decreases rebleeding and death in acute UGIB compared with a transfusion threshold of 9 g/dL. Patients with slow, chronic GIB may have very low hemoglobin values despite normal blood pressure and heart rate. With the development of iron-deficiency anemia, the mean corpuscular volume will be low and red blood cell distribution width will increase.

Typical physical findings in liver disease are icterus, hepatomegaly, hepatic tenderness, splenomegaly, spider angiomata, palmar erythema, and excoriations. Signs of advanced disease include muscle wasting, ascites, edema, dilated abdominal veins, hepatic fetor, asterixis, mental confusion, stupor, and coma. In male patients with cirrhosis, particularly that related to alcohol use, signs of hyperestrogenemia such as gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, and loss of male-pattern hair distribution may be found.

Icterus is best appreciated when the sclera is inspected under natural light. In fair-skinned individuals, a yellow tinge to the skin may be obvious. In dark-skinned individuals, examination of the mucous membranes below the tongue can demonstrate jaundice. Jaundice is rarely detectable if the serum bilirubin level is <43 μmol/L (2.5 mg/dL) but may remain detectable below this level during recovery from jaundice (because of protein and tissue binding of conjugated bilirubin).

Spider angiomata and palmar erythema occur in both acute and chronic liver disease; these manifestations may be especially prominent in persons with cirrhosis but can develop in normal individuals and are frequently found during pregnancy. Spider angiomata are superficial, tortuous arterioles and—unlike simple telangiectases— typically fill from the center outward. Spider angiomata occur only on the arms, face, and upper torso; they can be pulsatile and may be difficult to detect in dark-skinned individuals.

Gastrointestinal manifestations such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and ileus may suggest acute gastroenteritis. Stress ulceration can lead to upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Cholestatic jaundice, with elevated levels of serum bilirubin (mostly conjugated) and alkaline phosphatase, may precede other signs of sepsis. Hepatocellular or canalicular dysfunction appears to underlie most cases, and the results of hepatic function tests return to normal with resolution of the infection. Prolonged or severe hypotension may induce acute hepatic injury or ischemic bowel necrosis.

Many tissues may be unable to extract oxygen normally from the blood, so that anaerobic metabolism occurs despite near-normal mixed venous oxygen saturation. Blood lactate levels rise early because of increased glycolysis as well as impaired clearance of the resulting lactate and pyruvate by the liver and kidneys. The blood glucose concentration often increases, particularly in patients with diabetes, although impaired gluconeogenesis and excessive insulin release on occasion produce hypoglycemia. The cytokine-driven acute-phase response inhibits the synthesis of transthyretin while enhancing the production of C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and complement components. Protein catabolism is often markedly accelerated. Serum albumin levels decline as a result of decreased hepatic synthesis and the movement of albumin into interstitial spaces.

CliniCal and laboratory findings Persons with type I GSD may develop hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis during the neonatal period; however, more commonly, they exhibit hepatomegaly at 3–4 months of age. Hypoglycemia, hypoglycemic seizures, and lactic acidosis can develop after a short fast. These children usually have doll-like faces with fat cheeks, relatively thin extremities, short stature, and a protuberant abdomen that is due to massive hepatomegaly. The kidneys are enlarged, but the spleen and heart are of normal size. The hepatocytes are distended by glycogen and fat, with large and

Easy bruising and epistaxis are associated with a prolonged bleeding time as a result of impaired platelet aggregation/adhesion. Hyperuricemia is present. Hyperlipidemia includes elevation of triglycerides, low-density lipoproteins, and phospholipids. Type Ib patients have additional findings of neutropenia and impaired neutrophil function, which result in recurrent bacterial infections and oral and intestinal mucosal ulceration.

Cough results from stimulation of irritant receptors in the airway mucosa. Acute cough generally is associated with respiratory infections or irritant exposure (smoke) and subsides as the infection resolves or the exposure is eliminated. The characteristics of the cough and the circumstances under which the cough occurs help in determining the cause. Sudden onset after a choking episode suggests foreign body aspiration. Morning cough may be due to the accumulation of excessive secretions during the night from sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, or bronchial infection. Nighttime coughing is a hallmark of asthma and can also be caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease. Cough exacerbated by lying flat may be due to postnasal drip, sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, or reflux. Recurrent coughing with exercise is suggestive of exercise-induced asthma/bronchospasm. Paroxysmal cough suggests pertussis or foreign body aspiration. A repetitive, staccato cough occurs in chlamydial infections in infants. A harsh, brassy, seal-like cough suggests croup, tracheomalacia, or psychogenic (habit) cough. The last, which is most common in teenagers, disappears during sleep. Younger children can develop a throat-clearing habit cough, which also disappears during sleep.

Bronchiolitis is a leading cause of hospitalization of infants. Bronchiolitis occurs almost exclusively during the first 2 years of life, with a peak age at 2 to 6 months. Many healthy children with bronchiolitis can be managed as outpatients; however, premature infants and children with chronic lung disease of prematurity, hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease, neuromuscular weakness, or immunodeficiency are at increased risk of severe, potentially fatal disease. Children acquire infection after exposure to infected family members, who typically have symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection, or from infected children in day care. In the United States, annual peaks are usually in the late winter months from December through March.

Bronchiolitis caused by RSV has an incubation period of 4 to6 days. Bronchiolitis classically presents as a progressive respiratory illness similar to the common cold in its early phasewith cough and rhinorrhea. It progresses over 3 to 7 days tonoisy, raspy breathing and audible wheezing. There is usually a low-grade fever accompanied by irritability, which mayreflect the increased work of breathing. In contrast to the classic progression of disease, young infants infected with RSV may not have a prodrome and may have apnea as the first signof infection.

Physical signs of bronchiolar obstruction include prolongation of the expiratory phase of breathing, nasal flaring, intercostal retractions, suprasternal retractions, and air trapping with hyperexpansion of the lungs. During the wheezing phase, percussion of the chest usually reveals only hyperresonance, but auscultation usually reveals diffuse wheezes and crackles throughout the breathing cycle. With more severe disease, grunting and cyanosis may be present.

Routine laboratory tests are not required to confirm the diagnosis. It is important to assess oxygenation in severe cases of bronchiolitis. Pulse oximetry is adequate for monitoring oxygen saturation. Frequent, regular assessments and cardiorespiratory monitoring of infants are necessary because respiratory failure may develop precipitously in very tired infants even though blood gas values taken before rapid decompensation are reassuring.

Examination of the chest includes inspection of the chest wall to identify asymmetry resulting from absence of the pectoralis muscle and inspection of the breast tissue to determine gestational age and detect a breast abscess. Boys and girls may have breast engorgement and produce milk; milk expression should not be attempted. Supernumerary nipples may be bilateral and may be associated with renal anomalies.

Examination of the lungs includes observations of the rate, depth, and nature of intercostal or sternal retractions. Breath sounds should be equal on both sides of the chest, and rales should not be heard after the first 1 to 2 hours of life. Diminished or absent breath sounds on one side suggest pneumothorax, collapsed lung, pleural effusion, or diaphragmatic hernia. Shift of the cardiac impulse away from a tension pneumothorax and diaphragmatic hernia and toward the collapsed lung is a helpful physical finding for differentiating these disorders. Subcutaneous emphysema of the neck or chest also suggests a pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum, whereas bowel sounds auscultated in the chest in the presence of a scaphoid abdomen suggest a diaphragmatic hernia.

The position of the heart in infants is more midline than in older children. The first heart sound is normal, whereas the second heart sound may not be split in the first day of life. Decreased splitting of the second heart sound is noted in PPHN, transposition of the great vessels, and pulmonary atresia. Heart murmurs in newborns are common in the delivery room and during the first day of life. Most of these murmurs are transient and are due to closure of the ductus arteriosus, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, or a small ventral septal defect. Pulses should be palpated in the upper and lower extremities (over the brachial and femoral arteries). Blood pressure in the upper and lower extremities should be measured in all patients with a murmur or heart failure. An upperto-lower extremity gradient of more than 10 to 20 mm Hg suggests coarctation of the aorta.

Chronic cough is defined as a daily cough lasting longer than 3 weeks. Common causes of chronic cough are asthma, postnasal drip (allergic rhinitis, sinusitis), and postinfectious tussive syndromes. It can also be caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease, swallowing dysfunction (infants), anatomic abnormalities (tracheoesophageal fistula, tracheomalacia), and chronic infection. Persistent cough may also be caused by exposure to irritants (tobacco and wood stove smoke) or foreign body aspiration, or it may be psychogenic in origin.

During the first several years of life, children experience frequent viral respiratory infections, especially if they have multiple older siblings or attend day care or preschool. Cough that resolves promptly and is clearly associated with a viral infection does not require further diagnostic workup. However, cough persisting longer than 3 weeks warrants further evaluation.

Chest radiographs are useful in assessing respiratory disease in children. In addition to determining lung abnormalities, they provide information about the bony thorax (rib or vertebral abnormalities), the heart (cardiomegaly, pericardial effusion), and the great vessels (right aortic arch/vascular rings, rib notching). Chest radiographs should be obtained in both the posteroanterior (PA) and lateral projections and, if possible, following a full inspiration. Estimation of lung hyperinflation based on a single PA view is unreliable; flattened diaphragms and an increased AP diameter on lateral projection is a better indicator of hyperinflation. Crowding of the blood vessels with poor inspiration can be misinterpreted as increased markings or infiltrates. External skin folds, rotation, and motion may produce distorted or unclear images. Expiratory views and fluoroscopy may detect partial bronchial obstruction due to an aspirated foreign body that results in regional hyperinflation, because the affected lung or lobe does not deflate on exhalation. Fluoroscopy can also be used to evaluate diaphragm movement.

Erosive Adenomatosis of the Nipple papillary lesions in 92 patients (36%). Office-based, minimally invasive breast ductoscopy with intraductal biopsy is available in some centers (183,184). It was performed for diagnosis in 83 patients with nipple discharge (183). A diagnosis of severe or malignant atypia was established in 21% of patients.

Cytologic examination of nipple discharge or cyst ﬂuid rarely is performed. Cytologic examination usually is of no value but may identify malignant cells (178). Negative findings do not rule out cancer, which is more likely in women older than 50 years of age. In any case, the involved duct—and a mass, if present—should be excised (177,178,180,185). Complete histopathologic evaluation of the involved ductal system is the preferred method of diagnosis, and cytologic assessment should not be relied on for diagnosis.

The usual approach for nipple discharge is surgical excision through a periareolar incision adjacent to the trigger point, the pressure point that elicits nipple discharge (179). A microdochetomy of a single duct or a central duct excision of the major subareolar ducts can be performed under local or general anesthesia. The putative duct can be cannulated, methylene blue can be injected, or a lacrimal probe can be inserted into the duct for localization. A resection of breast tissue for 3 to 5 cm, or until no bloody ﬂuid can be identified in the ductal system, is performed. The patient must be warned of possible skin and nipple loss as a result of compromised vascularity, change in nipple sensation, deformity, inability to breastfeed, and recurrence if only a single duct if removed.

The standard screening modalities of mammography and physical examination are complementary. Approximately 10% to 50% of cancers detected mammographically are not palpable, whereas physical examination detects 10% to 20% of cancers not seen radiographically (17). The purpose of screening is to detect tumors when they are small (<1 cm) and have the highest potential for surgical cure. Most trials show a 20% to 30% reduction in breast cancer mortality for women age 50 and older who undergo annual screening mammography. Data on screening women younger than 40 years are more controversial. Results from the Gothenburg screening trial showed a 45% reduction in mortality for women screened between the ages of 40 and 49 (18). Because of these findings, it is recommended that all women undergo yearly screening mammography starting at age 40, along with clinical breast examination at least every 3 years (19). Monthly breast self-examination (BSE) is no longer recommended because there is little evidence to show that BSE is superior to heightened breast awareness such that any new symptoms related to the breast in daily activities would be reported promptly when noticed. BSE was not shown to improve survival. Women should be informed about the benefits and limitations of monthly BSE, mainly the risk of a false-positive result. Women who would still prefer to perform BSE should be instructed in the technique and occasionally have their technique reviewed. No other tests, including ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) scans, sestamibi scans, positron emission tomography (PET) scans, or serum blood markers, have been shown to be effective screening modalities. Screening guidelines recommended by the American College of Radiology and the American Cancer Society are presented in Table 40.1. In 2010, the ACS recommended annual screening mammography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) starting at age 30 for women with a known BRCA mutation and other high-risk genetic syndromes, women who are untested with a first-degree relative with the BRCA mutation and women with an approximately 20% to 25% or greater lifetime risk of breast cancer, or women who have been treated with radiation for Hodgkin’s lymphoma (19). Although breast MRI may prove to be advantageous for other women with an elevated risk of breast cancer, there

The spectrum of normal sexual response varies from one woman to another and throughout a woman’s lifetime (1–3). Physicians should be aware of their patients’ sexual values, attitudes about specific practices, and concerns about their sexuality. Maintaining open communication with patients about their sexuality allows the physician to counsel them about sexual issues and problems and other aspects of their reproductive health.

Sexual Activity Sexual activity among adolescents in the United States increased during the past 20 years (3). The average age for first intercourse for both men and women is 16 years. By 19 years of age, as many as three-quarters of women have had intercourse. Most young men and young women have multiple serial sexual partners but use condoms inconsistently, thereby exposing themselves to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and unintended pregnancies. A recent study of North American women, using a large and diverse community-based sample, shows that of the 3,205 women aged 30 to 79 years almost one-half were not sexually active in the previous 4 weeks, with 52% of those citing lack of interest and 61% citing lack of partner as the major reasons. Of those who were sexually active recently, 13.7% noted sexual problems and dissatisfaction with their overall sexual lives (4).

Patient risk factors: High-risk patients are > 50 years of age, immunocompromised, or with preexisting malignancy.

If SAH is suspected, obtain a head CT without contrast.

If CT is , LP is mandatory.

Obtain a CBC.

If temporal arteritis is suspected, obtain ESR.

A CT/MRI is needed for suspected SAH, ↑ ICP, or focal neurologic findings. Use CT without contrast to evaluate acute hemorrhage.

Affects females more often than males; may be familial. Associated with vascular and brain neurotransmitter (serotonin) changes. Pain is ultimately linked to trigeminal nucleus activation in the brain stem.

Auras appear to result from a different pathomechanism (electrical spreading depression in the brain, possibly linked to ion channel dysfunction) and may occur with or without the pain of migraine headache. Onset usually occurs by the early 20s.

Triggers include certain foods (e.g., red wine), fasting, stress, menses, OCPs, bright light, and disruptions in normal sleep patterns.

Hx/PE:

Presents with a throbbing headache (> 2 hours but usually < 24 hours, and almost always < 72 hours in duration) that is associated with nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and noise sensitivity. Headache is usually relieved by sleep and darkness.

Classic migraines: Often unilateral and preceded by a visual aura in the form of either scintillating scotomas (bright or ﬂashing lights) or visual field cuts.

Common migraines: May be bilateral and periorbital without preceding auras.

Dx: Based on history.

Tx:

Avoid known triggers.

Abortive therapy includes triptans (first line after OTC NSAIDs have failed), metoclopramide, and various analgesics. Consider symptomatic treatment for nausea.

A major therapeutic advance has occurred with the discovery that exudative macular degeneration can be treated with intraocular injection of antagonists to vascular endothelial growth factor. Bevacizumab, ranibizumab, or aflibercept is administered by direct injection into the vitreous cavity, beginning on a monthly basis. These antibodies cause the regression of neovascular membranes by blocking the action of vascular endothelial growth factor, thereby improving visual acuity.

Central Serous Chorioretinopathy This primarily affects males between the ages of 20 and 50 years. Leakage of serous fluid from the choroid causes small, localized detachment of the retinal pigment epithelium and the neurosensory retina. These detachments produce acute or chronic symptoms of metamorphopsia and blurred vision when the macula is involved. They are difficult to visualize with a direct ophthalmoscope because the detached retina is transparent and only slightly elevated. Optical coherence tomography shows fluid beneath the retina, and fluorescein angiography shows dye streaming into the subretinal space. The cause of central serous chorioretinopathy is unknown. Symptoms may resolve spontaneously if the retina reattaches, but recurrent detachment is common. Laser photocoagulation has benefited some patients with this condition.

Tx: This is a medical emergency that can cause blindness. Treatment to ↓ IOP may include eyedrops (timolol, pilocarpine, apraclonidine) or systemic medications (oral or IV acetazolamide, IV mannitol). Laser peripheral iridotomy, which creates a hole in the peripheral iris, is curative and may be performed prophylactically.

In the United States, macular degeneration is the leading cause of permanent bilateral visual loss in the elderly.

Risk factors include age > 40 years, African-American ethnicity, diabetes, and myopia.

Hx/PE: Usually asymptomatic until late in the clinical course, when patients may begin to notice visual deficits. Should be suspected in patients > 35 years of age who need frequent lens changes and have mild headaches, visual disturbances, and impaired adaptation to darkness. The earliest visual defect is seen in the peripheral nasal fields. Cupping of the optic nerve head is seen on funduscopic exam.

Dx: Tonometry, ophthalmoscopic visualization of the optic nerve, and visual field testing are most important. A diseased trabecular meshwork obstructs proper drainage of the eye, gradually increasing pressure and leading to progressive vision loss.

Tx: Treat with topical β-blockers (timolol, betaxolol) to ↓ aqueous humor production or with pilocarpine to ↑ aqueous outﬂow. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may also be used. If medication fails, laser trabeculoplasty or a trabeculectomy can improve aqueous drainage.

More common among Caucasians, females, smokers, and those with a family history.

Presents with painless loss of central vision.

Atrophic (“dry”) macular degeneration: Responsible for 80% of cases. Causes gradual vision loss.

The probability of success with any one of the antimigraine drugs is 50–75%. Many patients are managed adequately with low-dose amitriptyline, propranolol, candesartan, topiramate, or valproate. If these agents fail or lead to unacceptable side effects, second-line agents such as methysergide or phenelzine can be used. Once effective stabilization is achieved, the drug is continued for ~6 months and then slowly tapered to assess the continued need. Many patients are able to discontinue medication and experience fewer and milder attacks for long periods, suggesting that these drugs may alter the natural history of migraine.

TENSION-TYPE HEADACHE Clinical Features The term tension-type headache (TTH) is commonly used to describe a chronic head-pain syndrome characterized by bilateral tight, band-like discomfort. The pain typically builds slowly, fluctuates in severity, and may persist more or less continuously for many days. The headache may be episodic or chronic (present >15 days per month).

A useful clinical approach is to diagnose TTH in patients whose headaches are completely without accompanying features such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia, osmophobia, throbbing, and aggravation with movement. Such an approach neatly separates reuptake inhibitors: fluoxetine aCommonly used preventives are listed with typical doses and common side effects.

A 32-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with weakness and hypokalemia. The patient had been very healthy until 2 months previously when he developed intermittent leg weakness. His review of systems was otherwise negative. He denied drug or laxative abuse and was on no medications. Past medical history was unremarkable, with no history of neuromuscular disease. Family history was notable for a sister with thyroid disease. Physical examination was notable only for reduced deep tendon reflexes.

This patient developed hypokalemia due to a redistribution of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular compartments; this pathophysiology was readily apparent following calculation of the TTKG. The TTKG is calculated as (P × U )/(P ×

U ). The expected values for the TTKG are <3 in the presence of hypokalemia and >7–8 in the presence of hyperkalemia (see also Case 2 and Case 8). Alternatively, a urinary K+-to-creatinine ratio of >13 mmol/g creatinine (>1.5 mmol/mmol creatinine) is compatible with excessive renal K+ excretion. In this case, the calculated TTKG was 2.5, consistent with appropriate renal conservation of K+ and a nonrenal cause for hypokalemia. In the absence of significant gastrointestinal loss of K+, the patient was diagnosed with a “redistributive” subtype of hypokalemia.

Hemodialysis is the most effective and reliable method to reduce plasma K+ concentration; peritoneal dialysis is considerably less effective. Patients with acute kidney injury require temporary, urgent venous access for hemodialysis, with the attendant risks; in contrast, patients with ESRD or advanced chronic kidney disease may have a preexisting venous access. The amount of K+ removed during hemodialysis depends on the relative distribution of K+ between ICF and ECF (potentially affected by prior therapy for hyperkalemia), the type and surface area of the dialyzer used, dialysate and blood flow rates, dialysate flow rate, dialysis duration, and the plasma-to-dialysate K+ gradient.

A 65-year-old man has a history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease with baseline creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL. Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2–3+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?

Abnormalities in fluid volume and electrolyte composition are common and important clinical disorders. Drugs that block specific transport functions of the renal tubules are valuable clinical tools in the treatment of these disorders. Although various agents that increase urine volume (diuretics) have been described since antiquity, it was not until 1937 that carbonic anhydrase inhibitors were first described and not until 1957 that a much more useful and powerful diuretic agent (chlorothiazide) became available.

Dystrophin is a long cytoskeletal protein that has an amino-terminal actin-binding domain and a carboxy-terminal domain that binds to the dystroglycan complex at adherens junctions on the cell membrane, thus tethering the sarcomere to the cell membrane at regions tightly coupled to adjacent contracting myocytes. Mutations in components of the dystrophin complex lead to muscular dystrophy and associated cardiomyopathy.

During activation of the cardiac myocyte, Ca2+ becomes attached to one of three components of the heterotrimer troponin C, which results in a conformational change in the regulatory protein tropomyosin; the latter, in turn, exposes the actin cross-bridge interaction sites (Fig. 265e-5). Repetitive interaction between myosin heads and actin filaments is termed cross-bridge cycling, which results in sliding of the actin along the myosin filaments, ultimately causing muscle shortening and/or the development of tension. The splitting of ATP then dissociates the myosin cross-bridge from actin. In the presence of ATP (Fig. 265e-5), linkages between actin and myosin filaments are made and broken cyclically as long as sufficient Ca2+ is present; these linkages cease when [Ca2+] falls below a critical level, and the troponintropomyosin complex once more prevents interactions between the myosin cross-bridges and actin filaments (Fig. 265e-6).

Binding of ATP to myosin decreases the affinity of myosin for actin, thereby resulting in the release of myosin from the actin filament (state d). Myosin then partially hydrolyzes the ATP, and

Control of Normal Cardiac Contractility

The vigor of contraction of heart muscle is determined by several processes that lead to the movement of actin and myosin filaments in the cardiac sarcomere (Figure 13–1). Ultimately, contraction results from the interaction of activator calcium (during systole) with the actin-troponin-tropomyosin system, thereby releasing the actin-myosin interaction. This activator calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The amount released depends on the amount stored in the SR and on the amount of trigger calcium that enters the cell during the plateau of the action potential.

A. Sensitivity of the Contractile Proteins to Calcium and Other Contractile Protein Modifications

The determinants of calcium sensitivity, ie, the curve relating the shortening of cardiac myofibrils to the cytoplasmic calcium concentration, are incompletely understood, but several types of drugs can be shown to affect calcium sensitivity in vitro. Levosimendan is a recent example of a drug that increases calcium sensitivity (it may also inhibit phosphodiesterase) and reduces symptoms in models of heart failure. A recent report suggests that an experimental drug, omecamtiv mecarbil (CK-1827452), alters the rate of transition of myosin from a low-actin-binding state to a strongly actin-bound, force-generating state. This action might increase contractility without increasing energy consumption, ie, increase efficiency.

B. Amount of Calcium Released from the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum

A small rise in free cytoplasmic calcium, brought about by calcium influx during the action potential, triggers the opening of calcium-gated, ryanodine-sensitive (RyR2) calcium channels in the membrane of the cardiac SR and the rapid release of a large amount of the ion into the cytoplasm in the vicinity of the actin-troponintropomyosin complex. The amount released is proportional to the amount stored in the SR and the amount of trigger calcium that enters the cell through the cell membrane. (Ryanodine is a potent negative inotropic plant alkaloid that interferes with the release of calcium through cardiac SR channels.)

Figure 16–37 Smooth muscle contraction. (A) Upon muscle stimulation by activation of cell-surface receptors, Ca2+ released into the cytoplasm from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) binds to calmodulin (see Figure 15–29). Ca2+-bound calmodulin then binds myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), which phosphorylates myosin light chain, stimulating myosin activity. Non-muscle myosin is regulated by the same mechanism (see Figure 16–39). (B) Smooth muscle cells in a cross section of cat intestinal wall. The outer layer of smooth muscle is oriented with the long axis of its cells extending parallel along the length of the intestine, and upon contraction will shorten the intestine. The inner layer is oriented circularly around the intestine and when contracted will cause the intestine to become narrower. Contraction of both layers squeezes material through the intestine, much like squeezing toothpaste out of a tube.

Childs.) muscle: its myosin II hydrolyzes ATP about 10 times more slowly than skeletal muscle myosin, producing a slow cycle of myosin conformational changes that results in slow contraction.

The heart is the most heavily worked muscle in the body, contracting about 3 billion (3 × 109) times during the course of a human lifetime (Movie 16.6). Heart cells express several specific isoforms of cardiac muscle myosin and cardiac muscle actin. Even subtle changes in these cardiac-specific contractile proteins—changes that would not cause any noticeable consequences in other tissues—can cause serious heart disease (Figure 16–38).

Children and adolescents were affected for the most part, the disease rarely appearing beyond the age of 10 years. Typically, there is a history of primary measles infection at a very early age, often before 2 years, followed by a 6to 8-year asymptomatic period. The illness evolved in several stages. Initially there was a decline in proficiency at school, temper outbursts and other changes in personality, difficulty with language, and loss of interest in usual activities. These soon give way to a severe and progressive intellectual deterioration in association with focal or generalized seizures, widespread myoclonus, ataxia, and sometimes visual disturbances caused by progressive chorioretinitis. As the disease advances, rigidity, hyperactive reflexes, Babinski signs, progressive unresponsiveness, and signs of autonomic dysfunction appear. In the final stage, the child lies insensate, virtually “decorticated.”

The course is usually steadily progressive, death occurring within 1 to 3 years. A series of 39 such adult cases from India with mean age of 21 years was reported by Prashanth and coworkers, the oldest patient a 43-year-old. The main features were similar in most ways to childhood cases, except that several had visual disturbances and two had extrapyramidal features, raising the possibility of prion disease. Myoclonus was present early in the illness in 26 and developed later in all cases; the movements were described as “slow,” a characteristic alluded to in other series. In two cases that occurred in pregnant women, blurred vision and weakness of limbs was followed by akinetic mutism, without a trace of myoclonus or cerebellar ataxia. Nevertheless, the progressive ataxic-myoclonic chronic dementia in a child is so typical that bedside diagnosis was usually possible.

document (1) 

The majority of affected patients are children 4 to 8 years of age, and males outnumber females 3:2 or 3:1 in most reported series. As a rule, symptoms have been present for 1 to 5 months before the diagnosis is made. The clinical picture is fairly distinctive and derives from secondary hydrocephalus and raised intracranial pressure as a result of blockage of the fourth ventricle. Typically, the child becomes listless, vomits repeatedly, and has a morning headache. The first diagnosis that suggests itself may be gastrointestinal disease or abdominal migraine. Soon, however, a stumbling gait, frequent falls, and diplopia as well as strabismus lead to a neurologic examination and the discovery of papilledema or sixth nerve palsies. However, when the tumor is located in the lateral cerebellum or in the cerebrum, as it usually is in adults, signs of raised intracranial pressure may be delayed. Dizziness (positional) and nystagmus are then frequent. A small proportion of children have a slight sensory loss on one side of the face and a mild facial weakness. Head tilt, the occiput being tilted back and away from the side of the tumor, indicates a developing cerebellar-foraminal herniation. Rarely, signs of spinal root and subarachnoid metastases precede cerebellar signs.

Extraneural metastases (cervical lymph nodes, lung, liver, and particularly bone) may occur, but usually only after craniotomy, which may allow tumor cells to reach scalp lymphatics. In rare instances the tumor cells may be spontaneously blood-borne and become metastatic to lung or liver. Decerebrate attacks (“cerebellar fits”) appear in the late stages of the disease.

Beginning in late childhood and adolescence (11 to 18 years) in a previously normal individual, the disease announces itself by a seizure, a burst of myoclonic jerks, or both. In about half the cases there are focal (often occipital) seizures. The illness may at first be mistaken for ordinary epilepsy, but within a few months it becomes evident that something far more serious is occurring. The myoclonus becomes widespread and can be evoked as a startle by noise, an unexpected tactile stimulus (even the tap of a reflex hammer), and also by excitement, or certain sustained

excitement, or certain sustained motor activities. An evoked train of myoclonic jerks may progress to a generalized seizure with loss of consciousness. As the disease advances, the myoclonus interferes increasingly with the patient’s motor activities until voluntary function is seriously impaired. Speech may be marred, much as it is in chorea. Close examination may also reveal an alteration in muscle tone and a slight degree of cerebellar ataxia. At this time, or even before the onset of myoclonus and seizures, the patient may experience visual hallucinations or exhibit irritability, odd traits of character, uninhibited or

character, uninhibited or impulsive behavior, and, ultimately, progressive failure in all cognitive functions. Deafness has been an early sign in a few cases.

If associated with meals, consider mesenteric ischemia, PUD, biliary disease, pancreatitis, or bowel pathology.

A family history of abdominal pain may indicate familial Mediterranean fever or acute intermittent porphyria.

If peritoneal signs, shock, or impending shock is present, emergent exploratory laparotomy is necessary. A positive β-hCG in the setting of shock is a ruptured ectopic pregnancy until proven otherwise. Abdominal pain plus syncope or shock in an older patient is a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) until proven otherwise.

If the patient is stable, a complete physical exam—including a rectal exam and, in women, a pelvic exam—is mandatory.

Obtain electrolytes, LFTs, amylase, lipase, urine or serum β-hCG, UA, and a CBC with differential.

Pneumonia can present as right or left upper quadrant abdominal pain.

All female patients with an acute abdomen require a pelvic exam and a pregnancy test to rule out PID, ectopic pregnancy, and ovarian torsion.

McBurney’s point is located one-third of the distance from the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus.

“Hamburger sign”: If a patient wants to eat, consider a diagnosis other than appendicitis. Anorexia is 80% specific for appendicitis.

Psoas sign: Passive extension of the hip leading to RLQ pain.

Obturator sign: Passive internal rotation of the ﬂ exed hip leading to RLQ pain.

Rovsing’s sign: Deep palpation of the LLQ leading to RLQ pain.

In perforated appendix, partial pain relief is possible, but peritoneal signs (e.g., rebound, guarding, hypotension, ↑ WBC count, fever) will ultimately develop.

Children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with retrocecal appendices may have atypical presentations that may result in misdiagnosis and ↑ mortality.

Diagnosed by clinical impression.

Look for fever, mild leukocytosis (11,000–15,000 cells/μL) with left shift, and UA with a few RBCs and/or WBCs.

If the clinical diagnosis is unequivocal, no imaging studies are necessary. Otherwise, studies include the following:

KUB: Fecalith or loss of psoas shadow.

Ultrasound: Enlarged, noncompressible appendix.

CT scan with contrast (95–98% sensitive): Periappendiceal stranding or ﬂuid; enlarged appendix.

The patient should be NPO and should receive IV hydration and antibiotics with anaerobic and gram-coverage.

Immediate open or laparoscopic appendectomy is the definitive treatment. If appendicitis is not found, complete exploration of the abdomen is performed.

Temporarily ↓ or discontinue oral feeds.

Initiate NG suction/parenteral feeds as necessary.

Replete electrolytes as needed.

↓ mesenteric blood supply leading to insufficient perfusion to intestinal tissue and ischemic injury. Causes include acute arterial occlusion (usually involving the SMA) from thrombosis (due to atherosclerosis) or embolism (due to atrial fibrillation or ↓ ejection fraction); nonocclusive arterial disease (low cardiac output, arteriolar vasospasm); and venous thrombosis (due to hypercoagulable states).

Patients present with sudden onset of severe abdominal pain out of proportion to the exam.

A history of prior episodes of similar abdominal pain after eating (“intestinal angina”) may be present.

Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and bloody stools.

Early abdominal exam is often unremarkable; later findings may include peritoneal signs (suggest bowel infarction).

Lab tests may show leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis with ↑ lactate, ↑ amylase, ↑ LDH, and ↑ CK.

AXR and CT may reveal bowel wall edema (“thumbprinting”) and air within the bowel wall (pneumatosis intestinalis).

Mesenteric angiography is the gold standard for arterial occlusive disease.

Volume resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, optimization of hemodynamics, and avoidance of vasoconstrictors.

Anticoagulation for arterial or venous thrombosis or embolism.

The mortality rate for acute mesenteric ischemia is > 50%.

Diverticulosis is the most common cause of acute lower GI bleeding in patients > 40 years of age.

Diverticular disease must be distinguished from colon cancer with perforation.

Avoid ﬂ exible sigmoidoscopy and barium enemas in the initial stages of diverticulitis because of perforation risk.

Vomiting typically follows the pain; early emesis is bilious and nonfeculent if the obstruction is proximal but feculent if it is distal.

In partial obstruction, there is continued passage of ﬂatus but no stool, whereas in complete obstruction, no ﬂatus or stool is passed (obstipation).

Abdominal exam often reveals distention, tenderness, prior surgical scars, or hernias.

Bowel sounds are characterized by high-pitched tinkles and peristaltic rushes.

Peristalsis may disappear later in disease progression. Fever, hypotension, rebound tenderness, and tachycardia suggest peritonitis, a surgical emergency.

CBC may demonstrate leukocytosis if there is ischemia or necrosis of bowel.

Labs often reﬂ ect dehydration and metabolic alkalosis due to vomiting. Lactic acidosis is particularly worrisome, as it suggests necrotic bowel and the need for emergent surgical intervention.

Abdominal films often demonstrate a stepladder pattern of dilated small-bowel loops, air-f uid levels (see Figure 2.6-3), and a paucity of gas in the colon. The presence of radiopaque material at the cecum is suggestive of gallstone ileus.

IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion.

The leading cause of SBO in children is hernias. The leading cause of SBO in adults is adhesions.

Never let the sun rise or set on a complete SBO.

Anticholinergics, opioids, and hypokalemia slow GI motility.

2023-11-29 14:09:57,290 query: A 56-year-old man comes to the clinic for a check-up. He presents with a 1-year history of worsening shortness of breath and weight loss. He is a former construction worker, and worked in a steel mill when he was in high school. He is an active smoker with a 36-pack-year smoking history. The blood pressure is 130/78 mm Hg, pulse rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, and the BMI is 31 kg/m2. The patient is afebrile and the oxygen saturation at rest is 95% on room air. The pulmonary examination reveals a mildly prolonged expiratory phase, and no wheezing or crackles are auscultated. A pulmonary function test is recommended for the patient, and 2 weeks later he returns with a report that shows an FEV1/FVC ratio of 60% and FEV1 of 50% of the predicted value. The lung volumes show a total lung capacity of 110% of predicted value, a residual volume of 115% of predicted value, and a DLCO of 60% of predicted value. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Abnormal results on pulmonary function testing can beused to categorize obstructive airway disease (low flow rates and increased RV or FRC) or a restrictive defect (low FVCand TLC, with relative preservation of flow rates and FRC).When the FEV1 and flow rates are decreased to a greaterextent than the FVC, then airway obstruction is likely; however, a proportional decrease in FVC, FEV1, and flow rates suggests a restrictive lung defect. The mean midexpiratoryflow rate (FEF25–75%) is a more sensitive measure of small airways disease than the FEV1, but is also more variable. Pulmonary function testing can detect reversible airway obstruction characteristic of asthma with a significant improvementin FEV1 (>12%-15%) or in FEF25–75% (>25%) followinginhalation of a bronchodilator. Spirometry is also useful forlongitudinal patient management. The peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) can be obtained with a simple handheld deviceand may be useful for home monitoring of older childrenwith asthma. However, it is highly dependent on patienteffort, and values must be interpreted with caution. Inhalation challenge tests using methacholine, histamine, or cold, dry air are used to assess airway hyperreactivity, but require sophisticated equipment and special expertise and should be performed only in a pulmonary function laboratory with experienced technicians.

Endoscopic Evaluation of the Airways

document (1) 

Pulmonary Function Testing (See also Chap. 307) The initial pulmonary function test obtained is spirometry. This study is an effort-dependent test used to assess for obstructive pathophysiology as seen in asthma, COPD, and bronchiectasis. A diminished-forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) (often defined as <70% of the predicted value) is diagnostic of obstruction. In addition to measuring FEV1 and FVC, the clinician should examine the flow-volume loop (which is effort-independent). A plateau of the inspiratory and expiratory curves suggests large-airway obstruction in extrathoracic and intrathoracic locations, respectively.

Spirometry with symmetric decreases in FEV1 and FVC warrants further testing, including measurement of lung volumes and the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). A total lung capacity <80% of the predicted value for a patient’s age, race, sex, and height defines restrictive pathophysiology. Restriction can result from parenchymal disease, neuromuscular weakness, or chest wall or pleural diseases. Restriction with impaired gas exchange, as indicated by a decreased DLCO, suggests parenchymal lung disease. Additional testing, such as measurements of maximal expiratory pressure and maximal inspiratory pressure, can help diagnose neuromuscular weakness. Normal spirometry, normal lung volumes, and a low DLCO should prompt further evaluation for pulmonary vascular disease.

Arterial blood gas testing is often helpful in assessing respiratory 1663 disease. Hypoxemia, while usually apparent with pulse oximetry, can be further evaluated with the measurement of arterial PO2 and the calculation of an alveolar gas and arterial blood oxygen tension difference ([A–a]DO2). Patients with diseases that cause ventilation-perfusion mismatch or shunt physiology have an increased (A–a) DO2 at rest. Arterial blood gas testing also allows the measurement of arterial PCO2. Hypercarbia can accompany severe airway obstruction (e.g., COPD) or progressive restrictive physiology, as in patients with neuromuscular weakness.

P. aeruginosa, or (rarely) S. pneumoniae. Aspiration pneumonia is typically a polymicrobial infection involving both aerobes and anaerobes. A significant pleural effusion should be tapped for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. If the fluid has a pH of <7, a glucose level of <2. 2 mmol/L, and a lactate dehydrogenase concentration of >1000 U/L or if bacteria are seen or cultured, then it should be completely drained; a chest tube is often required and video-assisted thoracoscopy may be needed for late treatment or difficult cases.

Follow-Up Fever and leukocytosis usually resolve within 2–4 days in otherwise healthy patients with CAP, but physical findings may persist longer. Chest radiographic abnormalities are slowest to resolve (4–12 weeks), with the speed of clearance depending on the patient’s age and underlying lung disease. Patients may be discharged from the hospital once their clinical conditions, including comorbidities, are stable. The site of residence after discharge (nursing home, home with family, home alone) is an important discharge timing consideration, particularly for elderly patients. For a hospitalized patient, a follow-up radiograph ∼4–6 weeks later is recommended. If relapse or recurrence is documented, particularly in the same lung segment, the possibility of an underlying neoplasm must be considered.

The prognosis of CAP depends on the patient’s age, comorbidities, and site of treatment (inpatient or outpatient). Young patients without comorbidity do well and usually recover fully after ~2 weeks. Older patients and those with comorbid conditions can take several weeks longer to recover fully. The overall mortality rate for the outpatient group is <1%. For patients requiring hospitalization, the overall mortality rate is estimated at 10%, with ~50% of deaths directly attributable to pneumonia.

The main preventive measure is vaccination (Chap. 148). Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices should be followed for influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.

Pneumonia Pneumonia is defined as inﬂammation of the distal lung that includes terminal airways, alveolar spaces, and the interstitium. Pneumonia may have multiple causes, including viral and bacterial infections or aspiration. Aspiration pneumonia is usually the result of depressed awareness commonly associated with the use of drugs and alcohol or anesthesia. Viral pneumonias are caused by multiple infectious agents, including inﬂuenza A or B, parainﬂuenza virus, or respiratory syncytial virus. Most viral syndromes are spread by aerosolization associated with coughing, sneezing, and even conversation. Incubation is short, requiring only 1 to 3 days before the acute onset of fever, chills, headache, fatigue, and myalgias. Symptom intensity is directly related to intensity of the host febrile reaction. Pneumonia develops in only 1% of patients who have a viral syndrome, but mortality rates may reach 30% in immunocompromised individuals and the elderly. An additional risk is the development of secondary bacterial pneumonias after the initial viral insult. These infections are more common in elderly patients and may explain the high fatality in this group (8). Staphylococcal pneumonias, which often arise from a previous viral infection, are extremely lethal regardless of patient age. The best treatment for viral pneumonia is prevention by immunization. Treatment is supportive and consists mostly of administration of antipyretics and ﬂuids.

Bacterial pneumonia is classified as either community acquired or nosocomial, and in many cases the classification determines prognosis and antibiotic therapy. Risk factors that contribute to mortality are chronic cardiopulmonary diseases, alcoholism, diabetes, renal failure, malignancy, and malnutrition. Prognostic features associated with poor outcome include greater than two lobe involvement, respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths per minute on presentation, severe hypoxemia (<60 mm Hg on room air), hypoalbuminemia, and septicemia. Pneumonia is a common cause of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a mortality rate between 50% and 70% (9,10).

candidiasis or hepatic candidiasis is a misnomer because the disease often involves the kidneys and other tissues; the term chronic disseminated candidiasis may be more appropriate. Because of the risk of bleeding with liver biopsy, diagnosis is often based on imaging studies (MRI, CT). Treatment should be directed to the causative agent (usually C. albicans but sometimes Candida tropicalis or other less common Candida species).

Premenopausal women with endometrial cancer invariably have abnormal uterine bleeding, which is often characterized as menometrorrhagia or oligomenorrhea, or cyclical bleeding that continues past the usual age of menopause. The diagnosis of endometrial cancer must be considered in premenopausal women if abnormal bleeding is persistent or recurrent or if obesity or chronic anovulation is present.

Signs Physical examination seldom reveals any evidence of endometrial carcinoma, although obesity and hypertension are commonly associated constitutional factors. Special attention should be given to the more common sites of metastasis. Peripheral lymph nodes and breasts should be assessed carefully. Abdominal examination is usually unremarkable, except in advanced cases in which ascites or hepatic or omental metastases may be palpable. On gynecologic examination, the vaginal introitus and suburethral area, and the entire vagina and cervix, should be carefully inspected and palpated. Bimanual rectovaginal examination should be performed specifically to evaluate the uterus for size and mobility, the adnexa for masses, the parametria for induration, and the cul-de-sac for nodularity.

Diagnosis Office endometrial aspiration biopsy is the accepted first step in evaluating a patient with abnormal uterine bleeding or suspected endometrial pathology (76). The diagnostic accuracy of office-based endometrial biopsy is 90% to 98% when compared with subsequent findings at dilation and curettage (D&C) or hysterectomy (77–79).

Def nition Functional endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterus. Endometrial tissue in the myometrium of the uterus. History/PE Presents with cyclical pelvic and/or rectal pain and dyspareunia (painful intercourse). Presents with the classic triad of noncyclical pain, menorrhagia, and an enlarged uterus. Diagnosis Requires direct visualization by laparoscopy or laparotomy. Classic lesions have a blue-black (“raspberry”) or dark brown (“powder-burned”) appearance. Ovaries may have endometriomas (the characteristic “chocolate cysts”). Ultrasound is useful but cannot distinguish between leiomyoma and adenomyosis. MRI can aid in diagnosis but is costly. Treatment Pharmacologic: Inhibit ovulation. Combination OCPs are frst line; other options include GnRH analogs (leuprolide) and danazol. Conservative surgical treatment: Excision, cauterization, or ablation of the lesions and lysis of adhesions. Twenty percent of patients can become pregnant subsequent to treatment. Defnitive surgical treatment: TAH/BSO +/– lysis of adhesions. Pharmacologic: Largely symptomatic relief. NSAIDs (frst line) plus OCPs or progestins. Conservative surgical treatment: Endometrial ablation or resection using hysteroscopy. Complete eradication of deep adenomyosis is diffcult and results in high treatment failure. Defnitive surgical treatment: Hysterectomy is the only def nitive treatment. Complications Infertility (the most common cause among menstruating women > 30 years of age). Rarely, can progress to endometrial carcinoma.

Pregnancy is the most common cause of abnormal uterine bleeding and amenorrhea. Always check a pregnancy test!

Normal menstrual bleeding ranges from two to seven days. Vaginal bleeding that occurs six or more months following the cessation of menstrual function is cancer related until proven otherwise.

To reduce uterine size before hysterectomy, patients with large leiomyomas may be pretreated with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist (8,9). In many cases, the reduction of uterine size is sufficient to permit vaginal hysterectomy when an abdominal hysterectomy would otherwise be necessary. In one prospective trial, premenopausal patients with leiomyomas the size of 14 to 18 weeks’ gestation were randomized to receive either 2 months of preoperative depot GnRH agonist or no GnRH agonist (8). Treatment with a short course (8 weeks) of leuprolide acetate before surgery enabled the procedures to be converted safely from an abdominal hysterectomy to a vaginal hysterectomy (9). This preoperative regimen was associated with a rise in hematocrit before surgery and a shorter hospital stay and convalescent period because patients were more likely to have a vaginal rather than an abdominal hysterectomy.

Excessive uterine bleeding is the indication for about 20% of hysterectomies. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding assumes abnormal bleeding without an obvious anatomic cause (see Chapter 14). Anovulatory uterine bleeding is typically associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition in which anovulatory cycles are common. The bleeding can be controlled by medical intervention with progestin, estrogen, or a combination of progestin and estrogen given as oral contraceptives. Ovulatory abnormal uterine bleeding can be controlled by nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory agents, hormonal intervention, tranexamic acid, or the levonorgestrel intrauterine device. In these patients, endometrial sampling should be performed before hysterectomy (10). Dilation and curettage is not an effective means of controlling bleeding and is not necessary before hysterectomy. Hysterectomy should be reserved for

If endometriosis is suspected, an operative laparoscopy with ablation of endometriotic implants usually decreases the severity of pelvic pain. Ablation of endo-metriotic implants can be performed with CO2 laser or elec-trocautery, and/or resection of deep endometriotic implants.48 Endometriomas can cause pain and if found should be treated by ovarian cystectomy.

Occasionally, Hodgkin’s lymphoma can present as a fever of unknown origin. This is more common in older patients who are found to have mixed-cellularity Hodgkin’s lymphoma in an abdominal site. Rarely, the fevers persist for days to weeks, followed by afebrile intervals and then recurrence of the fever. This pattern is known as Pel-Ebstein fever. Hodgkin’s lymphoma can occasionally present with unusual manifestations. These include severe and unexplained itching, cutaneous disorders

There are three vaccines available for long-term prevention.

Gardasil (HPV 4) is a quadrivalent vaccine against HPV types 6,11, 16, and 18. his is being replaced by Gardasil9 (HPV9), a nonavalent vaccine that protects against all the types in HPV 4 plus types 31,r33,r45, 52, and 58. Cervarix (HPV2) is a bivalent vaccine against HPVs 16 and 18. One of these vaccines is selected and given as a three-dose series on a schedule of 0, 1-2, and 6 months for those aged 15 to 26 years. A two-dose regimen, given at 0 and again at 6 to 12 months, is now recommended for girls aged 9 to 14 years (Meites, 2016). Vaccines are licensed for females aged 9 to 26 years, and the target age is 11 to 12 years. he vaccines are not recommended for pregnant women, however, inadvertent exposures do occur. No adverse pregnancy outcomes are associated with the vaccines (Moreira, 2016; Panagiotou, 2015; Vichnin, 2015). If a woman is found to be pregnant after starting the vaccination series, the remaining doses are delayed and given after delivery (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2017a). Women who are breastfeeding may receive the vaccine.

Vertical transmission rates ofHPV to the newborn are minimal. Juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis QoRRP) is a rare, benign neoplasm of the larynx. It can cause hoarseness and respiratory distress in children and is most often caused by HPV 6 or 11. Risks for infection are maternal genital HPV infection and longer labors (Niyibizi, 2014). Many newborns are likely exposed to HPV, but few develop JoRRP (Silverberg, 2003; Smith, 2004; Tenti, 1999). For example, the national incidence of JoRRP in 2006 in the United States ranged from 0.5 to 1 per 100,000 children (Marsico, 2014).

Hospitalized premature infant (<28 weeks of gestation or ≤1000-g birth weight), regardless of maternal history of varicella or VZV serologic status

In individuals >50 years of age, a VZV vaccine with 18 times the viral content of the Oka vaccine decreased the incidence of shingles by 51%, the burden of illness by 61%, and the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia by 66%. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has therefore recommended that persons in this age group be offered this vaccine in order to reduce the frequency of shingles and the severity of postherpetic neuralgia.

A second approach is to administer varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) to individuals who are susceptible, are at high risk for developing complications of varicella, and have had a significant exposure. This product should be given within 96 h (preferably within 72 h) of the exposure. Indications for administration of VZIG appear in Table 217-1.

Lastly, antiviral therapy can be given as prophylaxis to individuals at high risk who are ineligible for vaccine or who are beyond the 96-h window after direct contact. While the initial studies have used acyclovir, similar benefit can be anticipated with either valacyclovir or famciclovir. Therapy is instituted 7 days after intense exposure. At this time, the host is midway into the incubation period. This approach significantly decreases disease severity, if not totally preventing disease.

MMR vaccine should be ofered to nonpregnant women of childbearing age who do not have evidence of immunity whenever they make contact with the health-care system. Vaccination of all susceptible hospital personnel who might be exposed to patients with rubella or who might have contact with pregnant women is important. Rubella vaccination should be avoided 1 month before or during pregnancy because the vaccine contains attenuated live virus. No observed evidence links the vaccine and induced malformations, although the overall theoretical risk is up to 2.6 percent (McLean, 2013;

Swamy, 2015). MMR vaccination is not an indication for pregnancy termination.

Prenatal serological screening for rubella is indicated for all pregnant women. Women found to be nonimmune are ofered the MMR vaccine postpartum.

More than 200 antigenically distinct respiratory viruses cause the cominon cold, pharyngitis, laryngitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Rhinovirus, coronavirus, and adenovirus are major causes of the common cold. The RNA-containing rhinovirus and coronavirus usually produce a trivial, self-limited illness characterized by rhinorrhea, sneezing, and congestion. he DNA-containing adenovirus is more likely to produce cough and lower respiratory tract involvement, including pneumonia.

It is inexpensive, easy to administer, and safe.

Treatment after screening is more effective than subsequent treatment without screening.

Vaccines work by mimicking infections and triggering an immune response in which memory cells are formed to recognize and fght any future infection. There are several different vaccine formulations, as indicated in Table 2.4-1.

Recommended vaccination schedules for children and adults are outlined in Figures 2.4-4 through 2.4-6.

A bleeding score has been validated as a tool to predict patients more likely to have type 1 VWD (International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis Bleeding Assessment Tool [www.isth .org/resource/resmgr/ssc/isth-ssc_bleeding_assessment.pdf ]). This is most useful tool in excluding the diagnosis of a bleeding disorder, and thus avoiding unnecessary testing. One study found that a low bleeding score (≤3) and a normal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) had 99.6% negative predictive value for the diagnosis of VWD. Bleeding symptoms that appear to be more common in patients with bleeding disorders include prolonged bleeding with surgery, dental procedures and extractions, and/or trauma, menorrhagia or postpartum hemorrhage, and large bruises (often described with lumps).

Easy bruising and menorrhagia are common complaints in patients with and without bleeding disorders. Easy bruising can also be a sign of medical conditions in which there is no identifiable coagulopathy; instead, the conditions are caused by an abnormality of blood vessels or their supporting tissues. In Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, there may be posttraumatic bleeding and a history of joint hyperextensibility. Cushing’s syndrome, chronic steroid use, and aging result in changes in skin and subcutaneous tissue, and subcutaneous bleeding occurs in response to minor trauma. The latter has been termed senile purpura.

(Giannakopoulos, 2013). Testing for these other antibodies is not recommended (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2017). However, some studies have evaluated these nonconventional antiphospholipid antibodies in women who clinically meet APS criteria but do not have the classic antibody proile. In one study, treatment of women with these nonconventional antibodies ofered some beneits, such as a lower pregnancy loss rate (Mekinian, 2016).

Clinical features shown in Table 59-5 provide indications for testing. By international consensus, APS is diagnosed based on laboratory and clinical criteria found in Table 18-5 (p. 353). First, one of two clinical criteria-which are vascular thrombosis or certain pregnancy morbidity-must be present. With laboratory criteria, elevated levels of LAC, ACA, and anti-3zglycoprotein I should be conirmed on two occasions 12 weeks apart. he diagnosis can be further stratified based on the number of these tests that are positive (Miyakis, 2006).

Tests for LAC are nonspeciic coagulation tests. he partial thromboplastin time is generally prolonged because the anticoagulant interferes with conversion of prothrombin to thrombin in vitro. Tests considered more speciic are the dilute Russell vper venom test and the platelet neutralization procedure. here is currently disagreement as to which of these two is best for screening. If either is positive, then identiication of LAC is conirmed.

For nonpregnant patients with suspected thrombosis, the safety of withholding anticoagulation for 1 week has been established for those who have a compression ultrasound examination that is initially normal (Birdwell, 1998; Heijboer, 1993). Serial compression examinations are then performed because isolated undetected calf thromboses that ultimately extend into the proximal veins will do so within 1 to 2 weeks of presentation in approximately a fourth of patients.

In pregnant women, the important caveat is that normal findings with venous ultrasonography do not always exclude a pulmonary embolism. his is because the thrombosis may have already embolized or because it arose from iliac or other deeppelvic veins, which are less accessible to ultrasound evaluation (Goldhaber, 2004). As discussed, thrombosis associated with pulmonary embolism during pregnancy commonly originates in the iliac veins.

normal thyroid hormone levels during early life. These children are often born to mothers with iodine deficiency, and it is likely that maternal thyroid hormone deficiency worsens the condition. Concomitant selenium deficiency may also contribute to the neurologic manifestations of cretinism. Iodine supplementation of salt, bread, and other food substances has markedly reduced the prevalence of cretinism. Unfortunately, however, iodine deficiency remains the most common cause of preventable mental deficiency, often because of societal resistance to food additives or the cost of supplementation. In addition to overt cretinism, mild iodine deficiency can lead to subtle

When tertiary or secondary hypothyroidism is detected, assessment of other pituitary hormones and investigation of pituitary-hypothalamic anatomy via magnetic resonance imaging are indicated. Although not a hypothyroid condition, congenital thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency occurs in about 1 in 10,000 live births and is associated with low serum total T4 concentration, normal TSH, and normal serum free T4. This is a euthyroid condition and does not require treatment with thyroid hormone because it is merely a binding protein abnormality. It is commonly X-linked dominant.

This form of severe intrauterine hypothyroidism (in mother and fetus) or postnatally as a hereditary or acquired thyroid disease, is probably the most frequent and potentially preventable and correctable metabolic cause of encephalopathy in the world. Although the condition is most common in goitrous regions where there is a lack of iodine, it may also be the result of any of several genetically determined defects in thyroxin synthesis that have come to light (Vassart et al). In areas of endemic cretinism, additional factors may be operative, such as the widespread ingestion of cassava, which contains a toxic goitrogen that inhibits the uptake of iodine by the thyroid.

The symptoms and signs of congenital thyroid deficiency are not usually recognizable at birth but become apparent only after a few weeks; more often the diagnosis is first made between the 6th and 12th months of life. Physiologic jaundice tends to have been severe and prolonged (up to 3 months), and this, along with widening of the posterior fontanelle and mottling of the skin, should raise suspicion of the disease.

Two types of early life hypothyroidism are recognized—sporadic and endemic. The sporadic type occurs occasionally in developed countries (less than once in 4,000 live births) and is a consequence of a congenital metabolic or anatomic disorder of the thyroid gland. At birth, the gland is either absent or represented by cysts, indicating a failure of development or a destructive lesion. In the sporadic form, in the latter part of the first year, stunting of growth and delay in psychomotor development become evident. Untreated, the child is severely developmentally delayed but placid and good natured; such children sleep contentedly for longer periods than normal children. Sitting, standing, and walking are delayed. Movements are slow, and if tendon reflexes can be obtained, their relaxation time is clearly delayed. The body temperature is low, and the extremities are cold and cyanotic. Although the head is small, the fontanelles may not close until the sixth or seventh year, and there is delayed ossification. This type of hypothyroidism is preventable by treatment with thyroid hormone.

Asia (Fig. 405-3). Europe remains mildly iodine-deficient, and health surveys indicate that iodine intake has been falling in the United States and Australia. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 2 billion people are iodine-deficient, based on urinary excretion data. In areas of relative iodine deficiency, there is an increased prevalence of goiter and, when deficiency is severe, hypothyroidism and cretinism. Cretinism is characterized by mental and growth retardation and occurs when children who live in iodine-deficient regions are not treated with iodine or thyroid hormone to restore normal thyroid hormone levels

Signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary depending on the infecting organism and the patient’s immune status. In typical pneumonias, the usual presentation is a patient with high fever, rigors, productive cough, chills, and pleuritic chest pain. Chest radiography often will show infiltrates (11). The following agents, listed in decreasing order, cause two-thirds of all bacterial pneumonias: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus inﬂuenza, Klebsiella pneumoniae, gram-negative organisms, and anaerobic bacteria. Atypical pneumonias are more insidious in onset than typical pneumonias. Patients have moderate fever without the characteristic rigors and chills. Additional symptoms include a nonproductive cough, headache, myalgias, and mild leukocytosis. Chest radiography reveals bronchopneumonia with a diffuse interstitial pattern; characteristically, the patient does not appear to be as ill as the x-ray suggests. Common causes of atypical pneumonia include viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia pneumoniae (also called the TWAR agent), and other rare agents.

A strong index of suspicion is required for diagnosis, especially in elderly and immunocompromised individuals, who have altered response mechanisms. This is true with “typical agents.” Subtle clues in the elderly include changes in mentation, confusion, and exacerbation of other illnesses. The febrile response may be entirely absent, and the results of the physical examination are not predictive of pneumonia. In high-risk groups, an increased respiratory rate of greater than 25 breaths per minute remains the most reliable sign of infection. Mortality in these high-risk groups of patients is strongly correlated with the ability of the host to mount normal defenses to the symptoms of fever, chills, and tachycardia.

All women suspected of having pneumonia should undergo chest radiography to establish the diagnosis and to detect alternate diagnoses such as congestive heart failure and tumors.

Pneumonia Pneumonia is defined as inﬂammation of the distal lung that includes terminal airways, alveolar spaces, and the interstitium. Pneumonia may have multiple causes, including viral and bacterial infections or aspiration. Aspiration pneumonia is usually the result of depressed awareness commonly associated with the use of drugs and alcohol or anesthesia. Viral pneumonias are caused by multiple infectious agents, including inﬂuenza A or B, parainﬂuenza virus, or respiratory syncytial virus. Most viral syndromes are spread by aerosolization associated with coughing, sneezing, and even conversation. Incubation is short, requiring only 1 to 3 days before the acute onset of fever, chills, headache, fatigue, and myalgias. Symptom intensity is directly related to intensity of the host febrile reaction. Pneumonia develops in only 1% of patients who have a viral syndrome, but mortality rates may reach 30% in immunocompromised individuals and the elderly. An additional risk is the development of secondary bacterial pneumonias after the initial viral insult. These infections are more common in elderly patients and may explain the high fatality in this group (8). Staphylococcal pneumonias, which often arise from a previous viral infection, are extremely lethal regardless of patient age. The best treatment for viral pneumonia is prevention by immunization. Treatment is supportive and consists mostly of administration of antipyretics and ﬂuids.

Bacterial pneumonia is classified as either community acquired or nosocomial, and in many cases the classification determines prognosis and antibiotic therapy. Risk factors that contribute to mortality are chronic cardiopulmonary diseases, alcoholism, diabetes, renal failure, malignancy, and malnutrition. Prognostic features associated with poor outcome include greater than two lobe involvement, respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths per minute on presentation, severe hypoxemia (<60 mm Hg on room air), hypoalbuminemia, and septicemia. Pneumonia is a common cause of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a mortality rate between 50% and 70% (9,10).

Pneumonia Pneumonia is the most common serious pneumococcal syndrome and is considered invasive when associated with a positive blood culture. Pneumococcal pneumonia can present as a mild community-acquired infection at one extreme and as a life-threatening disease requiring intubation and intensive support at the other.

presenting manifestations The presentation of pneumococcal pneumonia does not reliably distinguish it from pneumonia of other etiologies. In a subset of cases, pneumococcal pneumonia is recognized at the outset as associated with a viral upper respiratory infection and is characterized by the abrupt onset of cough and dyspnea accompanied by fever, shaking chills, and myalgias. The cough evolves from nonpurulent to productive of sputum that is purulent and sometimes tinged with blood. Patients may describe stabbing pleuritic chest pain and significant dyspnea indicating involvement of the parietal pleura. Among the elderly, the presenting clinical symptoms may be less specific, with confusion or malaise but without fever or cough. In such cases, a high index of suspicion is required because failure to treat pneumococcal pneumonia promptly in an elderly patient is likely to result in rapid evolution of the infection, with increased severity, morbidity, and risk of death.

findings on pHysical examination The clinical signs associated with pneumococcal pneumonia among adults include tachypnea (>30 breaths/min) and tachycardia, hypotension in severe cases, and fever in most cases (although not in all elderly patients). Respiratory signs are varied, including dullness to percussion in areas of the chest with significant consolidation, crackles on auscultation, reduced expansion of the chest in some cases as a result of splinting to reduce pain, bronchial breathing in a minority of cases, pleural rub in occasional cases, and cyanosis in cases with significant hypoxemia. Among infants with severe pneumonia, chest wall indrawing and nasal flaring are common. Nonrespiratory findings can include upper abdominal pain if the diaphragmatic pleura is involved as well as mental status changes, particularly confusion in elderly patients.

Figure 271e-20 A 48-year-old woman with severe idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. Echocardiography reveals evidence of marked right ventricular volume and pressure overload as evidenced by enlarged right ventricle (upper left and right), small left ventricle (upper left and upper right), and flattening of the interventricular septum (D-shaped septum) in systole and diastole (upper right). Tricuspid regurgitation velocity, which reflects the pressure gradient between the right ventricle and the left ventricle, is markedly elevated at 5 m/s, consistent with a right ventricle to right atrial pressure gradient of 100 mmHg, which is consistent with systemic right-sided pressures.

PART 10 Disorders of the Cardiovascular System

An urgent surgical procedure was performed.

Burr holes were placed around the region of the hematoma and it was evacuated. The small branch of the middle meningeal artery was ligated and the patient spent a few days in the intensive care unit. Fortunately the patient made an uneventful recovery.

A 35-year-old man was involved in a fight and sustained a punch to the right orbit. He came to the emergency department with double vision.

The double vision was only in one plane.

Examination of the orbits revealed that when the patient was asked to look upward the right eye was unable to move superiorly when adducted. There was some limitation in general eye movement. Assessment of the lateral rectus muscle (abducent nerve [VI]), superior oblique muscle (trochlear nerve [IV]), and the rest of the eye muscles (oculomotor nerve [III]) was otherwise unremarkable.

The patient underwent a CT scan.

A CT scan of the facial bones demonstrated a fracture through the floor of the orbit (Fig. 8.293).

A careful review of this CT scan demonstrated that the inferior oblique muscle had been pulled inferiorly with the fragment of bone in the fracture. This produced a tethering effect, so when the patient was asked to gaze in the upward direction, the left eye was able to do so but the right eye was unable to because of the tethered inferior oblique muscle.

The patient underwent surgical exploration to elevate the small bony fragment and return the inferior oblique to its appropriate position. On follow-up the patient had no complications.

A 25-year-old man complained of significant swelling in front of his right ear before and around mealtimes. This swelling was associated with considerable pain, which was provoked by the ingestion of lemon sweets. On examination he had tenderness around the right parotid region and a hard nodule was demonstrated in the buccal mucosa adjacent to the right upper molar teeth.

A diagnosis of parotid duct calculus was made.

Unfortunately for this patient, the sole blood supply to the head of the femur was via the vessels in the retinacula fibers, which were transected at the time of the fracture. If the patient had an intertrochanteric fracture instead, the vessels of the retinacula fibers would not have been damaged and a different approach to surgical fixation could be undertaken without the need for a hemiarthroplasty.

The patient has osteoporosis.

Osteoporosis is a common condition affecting older people, but is significantly more frequent in postmenopausal women. Many fractures of the femoral neck in elderly patients occur because the strength of the bone is significantly reduced when it is osteoporotic. Other common sites for osteoporotic fractures include the distal radius and the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae.

A 28-year-old woman was seen by her family practitioner for a routine pregnancy checkup at 36 weeks’ gestational age. Neither the patient nor the family physician had any concerns about the pregnancy. However, the patient did complain of unilateral swelling of her left leg, which had gradually increased over the previous 2 days. Furthermore, the evening before her visit she developed some sharp chest pain, which was exacerbated by deep breaths.

The family physician ordered a duplex ultrasound scan of the left leg venous system.

Ultrasound scanning of the vascular tree can demonstrate flow and occlusion of arteries and veins.

The probe was placed over the left femoral vein and no flow was demonstrated. Furthermore, the vein could not be compressed, and no alteration of flow with breathing could be demonstrated. Some flow was demonstrated in the deep femoral vein and in the great saphenous vein. No flow was demonstrated throughout the length of the left femoral vein, the popliteal vein, and the tibial veins.

The technician scanned the opposite side, where excellent flow was demonstrated within the right femoral venous system. In addition, when the calf was gently massaged an augmentation to the flow was noted. It was possible to demonstrate alteration of flow with respiratory excursion and venous compression was satisfactory. A diagnosis of extensive left-sided deep vein thrombosis was made.

Certain patients are more prone to deep vein thrombosis.

document (3) 

The pain is referred.

The visceral afferent (sensory) nerve fibers from the ureter pass into the spinal cord, entering the first and second lumbar segments of the spinal cord. Pain is thus referred to cutaneous regions innervated by somatic sensory nerves from the same spinal cord levels.

The patient was investigated by a CT scan.

Traditionally, a plain radiograph was used to look for the radiopaque stone (90% of renal stones are radiopaque) and this often proceeded to intravenous urography to determine precise location of renal stones. Currently, low-dose CT of the collecting system is used to visualize the renal stones and pinpoint the level of obstruction, using low radiation dose and no intravenous contrast.

An ultrasound scan may also be useful to assess for pelvicaliceal dilation and may reveal stones at the pelviureteral junction or the vesicoureteric junction. Ultrasound is also valuable for assessing other causes of obstruction (e.g., tumors at and around the ureteric orifices in the bladder) and is particularly useful in pregnant women when imaging with the use of radiation is a concern.

Usually an intravenous urogram would be carried out to enable assessment of the upper urinary tracts and precise location of the stone.

Not infrequently, CT scans of the abdomen are also obtained. These scans not only give information about the kidneys, ureters, and bladder but also show the position of the stone and other associated pathology.

If this patient’s infrascapular pain was on the right and predominantly within the right lower abdomen, appendicitis would also have to be excluded. A CT scan would enable differentiation of appendicitis and urinary colic.

A 27-year-old woman was admitted to the surgical ward with appendicitis. She underwent an appendectomy. It was noted at operation that the appendix had perforated and there was pus within the abdominal cavity. The appendix was removed and the stump tied. The abdomen was washed out with warm saline solution. The patient initially made an uneventful recovery, but by day 7 she had become unwell, with pain over her right shoulder and spiking temperatures.

In primary amyloidosis there is no evidence of preceding or coexisting disease (except the association with paraproteinemia or multiple myeloma). Secondary amyloidosis (AA), an infrequent occurrence nowadays, is the result of chronic infection or other chronic disease outside the nervous system and, as a rule, is not associated with neuropathy (e.g., it is not cited in the large recent series by Lachmann and colleagues [2007]). In contrast, familial amyloidosis, a third variety, is almost invariably associated with neuropathy but is associated with a paraprotein in only a small proportion of cases and the amount of immunoglobulin is small (see “Inherited [Familial Amyloidosis] Amyloid Neuropathies” later).

Primary amyloidosis is mainly a disease of older men, the median age at the time of diagnosis being 65 years. In our clinical material, the majority of the patients have had peripheral neuropathy, but this may reflect a referral bias as in other series, less than one-third were so affected (Kyle et al). The neuropathic symptoms and signs are similar to those of hereditary amyloid polyneuropathy discussed further on, but the progress of the disease is considerably more rapid.

A monoclonal immunoglobulin identified in the blood is referred to as an M protein, in reference to myeloma. Because complete M proteins have molecular weights of 160,000 or higher, they are restricted to the plasma and extracellular fluid and excluded from the urine in the absence of glomerular damage. However, neoplastic plasma cells often synthesize excess immunoglobulin light chains along with complete immunoglobulins. In unusual cases, tumors may produce only light chains, which are detected and quantified in the blood and the urine by highly sensitive tests.

Terms used to describe the abnormal immunoglobulins associated with plasma cell neoplasms include monoclonal gammopathy, dysproteinemia, and paraproteinemia. These abnormal proteins are associated with several clinicopathologic entities:

Multiple myeloma (plasma cell myeloma), the most important plasma cell neoplasm, usually presents as tumorous masses scattered throughout the skeletal system. Solitary plasmacytoma is an infrequent variant that presents as a single mass in bone or soft tissue. Smoldering myeloma is another uncommon variant defined by a lack of symptoms and a high plasma M component.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is applied to patients without signs or symptoms who have small to moderately large M components in their blood. MGUS is very common in older adults and has a low but constant rate of transformation to a symptomatic monoclonal gammopathy, most often multiple myeloma.

Primary or immunocyte-associated amyloidosis results from a monoclonal proliferation of plasma cells secreting light chains that are deposited as amyloid. Some http://ebooksmedicine.net patients have overt multiple myeloma, but others have only a minor clonal population of plasma cells in the marrow.

• Waldenström macroglobulinemia is a syndrome in which high levels of IgM lead to symptoms related to hyper-viscosity of the blood. It occurs in older adults, most commonly in association with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (described later).

Different autoantibodies are the cause of most of the lesions of SLE.

• Most of the systemic lesions are caused by immune complexes (type III hypersensitivity). DNA-anti-DNA complexes can be detected in the glomeruli and small blood vessels. Low levels of serum complement (secondary to consumption of complement proteins) and granular deposits of complement and immunoglobulins in the glomeruli further support the immune complex nature of the disease. T cell infiltrates are also frequently seen in the kidneys, but the role of these cells in tissue damage is not established.

Autoantibodies of different specificities contribute to the pathology and clinical manifestations of SLE (type II hypersensitivity). Autoantibodies specific for red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets opsonize these cells and promote their phagocytosis, resulting in cytopenias. There is no evidence that ANAs, which are involved in immune complex formation, can penetrate intact cells. If cell nuclei are exposed, however, the ANAs can bind to them. In tissues, nuclei of damaged cells react with ANAs, lose their chromatin pattern, and become homogeneous, producing so-called “LE bodies” or hematoxylin bodies. Related to this phenomenon are LE cells, which are readily seen when blood is agitated in vitro. An LE cell is a phagocyte (neutrophil or macrophage) that has engulfed the denatured nucleus of an injured cell. The demonstration of LE cells in vitro was used in the past as a test for SLE. With new techniques for detection of ANAs, however, this test is now only of historic interest. Sometimes, LE cells are found in pericardial or pleural effusions in patients.

Anteroposterior and frog-leg radiographs of the hip are usually normal. Ultrasonography may reveal a joint effusion. It is mandatory to rule out septic arthritis in the presence of effusion with a joint aspiration and cell count.

The mainstay of treatment is bed rest and minimal weight bearing until the pain resolves. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication is usually sufficient to decrease pain. Limiting strenuous activity and exercise for 1 to 2 weeks following recovery is helpful. Follow-up will help ensure that there is no deterioration. Lack of improvement necessitates further evaluation for more serious disorders.

Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCPD) is idiopathic avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis) of the capital epiphysis of the femoral head. The etiology is unclear, but it is likely caused by an interruption of the blood supply to the capital femoral epiphysis. There may be an associated hypercoagulability state (factor V Leiden).

LCPD commonly presents in patients 3 to 12 years of age, with a mean age of 7 years. It is four to five times more common in boys.

Patients may not present for several weeks because of minimaldiscomfort; the classic presentation is a child with an atraumatic, painless limp. There may be mild or intermittent hip/groin, anterior thigh, or knee pain. Decreased internal rotationand abduction with some discomfort, thigh muscle spasm, andanterior thigh muscular atrophy may be present. Patients havedelayed bone age.

A 62-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe interscapular pain. His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it was noted he was 6’ 9” and had undergone previous eye surgery for dislocating lenses.

On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis.

The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made.

Aortic dissection is an uncommon disorder in which a small tear occurs within the aortic wall (eFig. 3.120). The aortic wall contains three layers, an intima, a media, and an adventitia. A tear in the intima extends into the media and peels it away, forming a channel within the wall of the vessel. Usually the blood reenters the main vessel wall distal to its point of entry.

The myocardial infarction

Aortic dissection may extend retrogradely to involve the coronary sinus of the right coronary artery. Unfortunately, in this patient’s case the right coronary artery became occluded as the dissection passed into the origin. In normal individuals the right coronary artery supplies the anterior inferior aspect of the myocardium, and this is evident as an anterior myocardial infarct on an ECG.

The ischemic left leg

The two channels within the aorta have extended throughout the length of the aorta into the right iliac system and to the level of the right femoral artery. Although blood flows through these structures it often causes reduced blood flow. Hence the reduced blood flow into the left lower limb renders it ischemic.

The patient became acidotic.

document (1) 

The patient became acidotic.

All cells in the body produce acid, which is excreted in the urine or converted into water with the production of carbon dioxide, which is removed with ventilation. Unfortunately, when organs become extremely ischemic they release significant amounts of hydrogen ions. Typically, this occurs when the gut becomes ischemic. With the pattern of dissection, (1) the celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, and inferior mesenteric artery can be effectively removed from the circulation or (2) the blood flow within these vessels can be significantly impeded, rendering the gut ischemic and hence accounting for the relatively high hydrogen ion levels.

Similarly the dissection can impair blood flow to the kidneys, which decreases their ability to function.

The patient underwent emergency surgery and survived. Interestingly, the height of the patient and the previous lens surgery would suggest a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, and a series of blood tests and review of the family history revealed this was so.

A 35-year-old male patient presented to his family practitioner because of recent weight loss (14 lb over the previous 2 months). He also complained of a cough with streaks of blood in the sputum (hemoptysis) and left-sided chest pain. Recently, he noticed significant sweating, especially at night, which necessitated changing his sheets.

On examination the patient had a low-grade temperature and was tachypneic (breathing fast). There was reduced expansion of the left side of the chest. When the chest was percussed it was noted that the anterior aspect of the left chest was dull, compared to the resonant percussion note of the remainder of the chest. Auscultation (listening with a stethoscope) revealed decreased breath sounds, which were hoarse in nature (bronchial breathing).

A diagnosis of chest infection was made.

Chest infection is a common disease. In most patients the infection affects the large airways and bronchi. If the infection continues, exudates and transudates are produced, filling the alveoli and the secondary pulmonary lobules. The diffuse patchy nature of this type of infection is termed bronchial pneumonia.

Given the patient’s specific clinical findings, bronchial pneumonia was unlikely.

document (2) 

Hepatobiliary disorders, including cholecystitis and biliary colic, may mimic acute cardiopulmonary diseases. Although the pain arising from these disorders usually localizes to the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, it is variable and may be felt in the epigastrium and radiate to the back and lower chest. This discomfort is sometimes referred to the scapula or may in rare cases be felt in the shoulder, suggesting diaphragmatic irritation. The pain is steady, usually lasts several hours, and subsides spontaneously, without symptoms between attacks. Pain resulting from pancreatitis is typically aching epigastric pain that radiates to the back.

Musculoskeletal and Other Causes (See also Chap. 393) Chest discomfort can be produced by any musculoskeletal disorder involving the chest wall or the nerves of the chest wall, neck, or upper limbs.

PART 2 Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases

Costochondritis causing tenderness of the costochondral junctions (Tietze’s syndrome) is relatively common. Cervical radiculitis may manifest as a prolonged or constant aching discomfort in the upper chest and limbs. The pain may be exacerbated by motion of the neck. Occasionally, chest pain can be caused by compression of the brachial plexus by the cervical ribs, and tendinitis or bursitis involving the left shoulder may mimic the radiation of angina. Pain in a dermatomal distribution can also be caused by cramping of intercostal muscles or by herpes zoster (Chap. 217).

Emotional and Psychiatric Conditions As many as 10% of patients who present to emergency departments with acute chest discomfort have a panic disorder or related condition (Table 19-1). The symptoms may include chest tightness or aching that is associated with a sense of anxiety and difficulty breathing. The symptoms may be prolonged or fleeting.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT:

document (3) 

The diagnosis is one of exclusion, and care should be taken to ensure that patients do not have intermittent dizziness due to TIA. In patients < 50 years of age, a history of recent trauma or of severe, abrupt-onset, or persistent pain (> 72 hours) should raise concern for vertebral artery dissection with TIAs.

A brain MRI with vascular imaging (e.g., MRA) is sometimes indicated to assess potential intracranial pathology, particularly cerebrovascular disease.

Episodic ataxia type 2 can be corroborated by genetic testing.

Tx: Can usually be prevented through migraine medication, diet, or lifestyle changes. Benzodiazepines or antiemetics may be tried. Surgical therapies are not indicated.

One of the most common causes of loss of consciousness 2° to an abrupt drop in cerebral perfusion. Etiologies include cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac outﬂow obstruction, vasovagal syncope, orthostatic hypotension, micturition-related syncope, basilar TIAs, and idiopathic causes. Presyncope is described as a feeling of imminent loss of consciousness without actual fainting. Commonly confused with seizures.

Hx/PE:

Patients may report a trigger (e.g., standing for long period of time, fear/sight of blood, Valsalva maneuver).

Ménière’s disease consists of recurrent episodes, but unlike BPPV, these usually last hours to days.

Unlike Ménière’s, vestibular migraine usually has no associated auditory or aural symptoms.

Rule out vertebral artery dissection in those with persistent head or neck pain and intermittent isolated dizziness or vertigo.

■Typically follows a prodrome of lightheadedness or dizziness, muff ed sounds, constricting vision, diffuse weakness, diaphoresis, or pallor. Leads to loss of consciousness and muscle tone for < 30 seconds and recovery within seconds.

In 2016, 81 percent of U.S. newborns were initially breastfed, 52 percent were still breastfed at 6 months, and 31 percent at 1 year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016). According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017 e), exclusive breastfeeding is preferred until 6 months. In many hospitals, breastfeeding begins in the delivery room. Most term newborns thrive best when fed 8 to 12 times daily for approximately 15 minutes each episode. Preterm or growth-restricted newborns require feedings at shorter intervals. Breastfeeding is discussed further in Chapter 36 (p. 656).

Because most neonates actually receive little nutriment for the first 3 or 4 days of life, they progressively lose weight until the flow of maternal milk is established or other feeding is instituted. Preterm neonates lose relatively more weight and regain their birthweight more slowly. Conversely, growth-restricted but otherwise healthy newborns regain their initial weight more quickly than those born preterm. With proper nourishment, birthweight of term newborns usually is regained by 10 days.

For the irst 2 or 3 days after birth, the colon contains sot, brown-green meconium. his consists of desquamated epithelial cells from the intestinal tract, mucus, epidermal cells, and lanugo (fetal hair) that have been swallowed along with amnionic luid.

The characteristic color results from bile pigments. During fetal life and for a few hours after birth, the intestinal contents are sterile, but bacteria quickly colonize the bowel contents.

Meconium stooling is seen in 90 percent of newborns within the irst 24 hours, and most of the rest within 36 hours. Usually, newborns irst void shortly ater birth but may not until the second day. Meconium and urine passage indicates patency of the gastro intestinal and urinary tracts, respectively. Failure of the newborn to stool or urinate ater these times suggests a congenital defect, such as Hirschsprung disease, imperforate anus, or posterior urethral valve. Ater the third or fourth day, as a result of milk ingestion, meconium is replaced by light-yellow, soter, homogenous feces.

This is the midpoint of pregnancy as estimated from the LMP. The fetus now weighs somewhat more than 300 g, and weight increases substantially in a linear manner. From this point onward, the fetus moves approximately every minute and is active 10 to 30 percent of the day (DiPietro, 2005). Brown fat forms, and the fetal skin becomes less transparent. Downy lanugo covers its entire body, and some scalp hair can be seen. Cochlear function develops between 22 and 25 weeks, and its maturation continues for 6 months after delivery.

The fetus now weighs almost 700 g (Duryea, 2014). he skin is characteristically wrinkled, and fat deposition begins. The head is still comparatively large, and eyebrows and eyelashes are usually recognizable. By 24 weeks, the secretory type II pneumocytes have initiated surfactant secretion (Chap. 32, p. 607). The canalicular period of lung development, during which the bronchi and bronchioles enlarge and alveolar ducts develop, is nearly completed. Despite this, a fetus born at this time will attempt to breathe, but many will die because the terminal sacs, required for gas exchange, have not yet formed. The overall survival rate at 24 weeks is barely above 50 percent, and only approximately 30 percent survive without severe morbidity (Rysavy, 2015). By 26 weeks, the eyes open. Nociceptors are present over all the body, and the neural pain system is developed (Kadic, 2012). The fetal liver and spleen are important sites for hemopoiesis.

The crown-rump length approximates 25 cm, and the fetus weighs about 1100 g. The thin skin is red and covered with vernix caseosa. The pupillary membrane has just disappeared from the eyes. Isolated eye blinking peaks at 28 weeks. The bone marrow becomes the major site of hemopoiesis. he otherwise normal neonate born at this age has a 90-percent chance of survival.without physical or neurological impairment.

At each return visit, the well-being of mother and fetus are assessed (see Table 9-1). Fetal heart rate, growth, and activity and amnionic fluid volume are evaluated. Maternal blood pressure and weight and their extent of change are examined. Symptoms such as headache, altered vision, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, bleeding, vaginal luid leakage, and dysuria are sought. Mter 20 weeks' gestation, uterine examination measures size from the symphysis to the fundus. In late pregnancy, vaginal examination often provides valuable information that includes conirmation of the presenting part and its station, clinical estimation of pelvic capacity and configuration, amnionic luid volume adequacy, and cervical consistency, efacement, and dilatation (Chap. 22, p. 435).

Between 20 and 34 weeks' gestation, the height of the uterine fundus measured in centimeters correlates closely with gestational age in weeks Gimenez, 1983). his measurement is used to monitor fetal growth and amnionic fluid volume. It is measured along the abdominal wall from the top of the symphysis pubis to the top of the fundus. Importantly, the bladder must be emptied before fundal measurement (Worthen, 1980). Obesity or the presence of uterine masses such as leiomyomas may also limit fundal height accuracy. Moreover, using fundal height alone, fetal-growth restriction may be undiagnosed in up to a third of cases (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2015b; Haragan, 2015).

Instruments incorporating Doppler ultrasound are often used to easily detect fetal heart action, and in the absence of maternal obesity, heart sounds are almost always detectable by 10 weeks with such instruments (Chap. 10, p. 213). he fetal heart rate ranges from 11e0 to 160 beats per minute and is typically heard as a double sound. Using a standard nonampliied stethoscope, the fetal heart is audible by 20 weeks in 80 percent of women, and by 22 weeks, heart sounds are expected to be heard in all (Herbert, 1987). Because the fetus moves freely in amni onic fluid, the site on the maternal abdomen where fetal heart sounds can be heard best will vary.

he incidence of invasive cervical carcinoma has dramatically declined in the United States as a result of PAP testing (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2016b). This cancer is found in approximately 1 in 8500 pregnancies (Bigelow, 2017; Pettersson, 2010). The diagnosis is conirmed with biopsies taken during colposcopy, with conization, or from a grossly abnormal lesion. Of the histological types, squamous cell carcinomas account for 75 percent of all cervical cancers, whereas adenocarcinomas compose the remainder. Cancers may appear as exophytic or endophytic growth; as a polypoid mass, papillary tissue, or barrel-shaped cervix; or as focal ulceration or necrosis. A watery, purulent, foul, or bloody discharge may also be present. Biopsy with Tischler forceps is warranted for suspicious lesions. Abnormal tumor vessels may cause heavier than expected biopsy-site bleeding, which is usually controlled by Monsel paste and pressure.

Cervical cancer is staged clinically, and 70 to 75 percent of cases that are diagnosed in pregnancy are stage I (Bigelow, 2017; Morice, 2012). Physiological pregnancy changes may impede accurate staging, and the extent of cancer is more likely to be underestimated in pregnant women. Specifically, induration of the broad ligament base, which characterizes tumor spread beyond the cervix, may be less prominent due to cervical, paracervical, and parametrial pregnancy-induced softening. Staging in pregnancy typically incorporates indings from pelvic examination and from renal sonography, chest radiography, cystoscopy, proctoscopy, and perhaps cone biopsy. Although MR imaging is not formally considered for clinical staging, it can be used without gadolinium contrast to ascertain involvement of the urinaty tract and lymph nodes (Fig. 63-3).

In association with severe pelvic fractures, urethral rupture may occur at the prostatomembranous junction above the deep perineal pouch. The urine will extravasate into the true pelvis.

The worst and most serious urethral rupture is related to serious pelvic injuries where there is complete disruption of the puboprostatic ligaments. The prostate is dislocated superiorly not only by the ligamentous disruption but also by the extensive hematoma formed within the true pelvis. The diagnosis can be made by palpating the elevated prostate during a digital rectal examination.

A 25-year-old man visited his family physician because he had a “dragging feeling” in the left side of his scrotum. He was otherwise healthy and had no other symptoms. During examination, the physician palpated the left testis, which was normal, although he noted soft nodular swelling around the superior aspect of the testes and the epididymis. In his clinical notes, he described these findings as a “bag of worms” (Fig. 5.86). The bag of worms was a varicocele.

The venous drainage of the testis is via the pampiniform plexus of veins that runs within the spermatic cord. A varicocele is a collection of dilated veins that arise from the pampiniform plexus. In many ways, they are similar to varicose veins that develop in the legs. Typically, the patient complains of a dragging feeling in the scrotum and around the testis, which is usually worse toward the end of the day.

The family physician recommended surgical treatment, with a recommendation for surgery through an inguinal incision.

A simple surgical technique divides the skin around the inguinal ligament. The aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle is divided in the anterior abdominal wall to display the spermatic cord. Careful inspection of the spermatic cord reveals the veins, which are surgically ligated.

Another option is to embolize the varicocele.

A 50-year-old woman was admitted to hospital for surgical resection of the uterus (hysterectomy) for cancer. The surgeon was also going to remove all the pelvic lymph nodes and carry out a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of uterine tubes and ovaries). The patient was prepared for this procedure and underwent routine surgery. Twenty-five hours after surgery, it was noted that the patient had passed no urine and her abdomen was expanding. An ultrasound scan demonstrated a considerable amount of fluid within the abdomen. Fluid withdrawn from the abdomen was tested and found to be urine.

It was postulated that this patient’s ureters had been damaged during the surgery.

The pelvic part of the ureter courses posteroinferiorly and external to the parietal peritoneum on the lateral wall of the pelvis anterior to the internal iliac artery. It continues in its course to a point approximately 2 cm superior to the ischial spine and then passes anteromedially and superior to the levator ani muscles. Importantly, the ureter closely adheres to the peritoneum. The only structure that passes between the ureter and the peritoneum in men is the ductus deferens. In women, however, as the ureter descends on the pelvic wall, it passes under the uterine artery. The ureter continues close to the lateral fornix of the vagina, especially on the left, and enters the posterosuperior angle of the bladder.

It was at this point that the ureter was inadvertently damaged.

Knowing the anatomy and recognizing the possibility of ureteric damage enabled the surgeons to reestablish continuity of the ureter surgically. The patient was hospitalized a few days longer than expected and made an uneventful recovery.

A 25-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with a complaint of pain in her right iliac fossa. The pain had developed rapidly over approximately 40 minutes and was associated with cramps and vomiting. The surgical intern made an initial diagnosis of appendicitis.

systemic toxicity are signs of full-thickness necrosis and perforation.The diagnosis of ischemic colitis is often based on the clinical history and physical examination. Plain films may reveal thumb printing, which results from mucosal edema and submucosal hemorrhage. CT often shows nonspecific colonic wall thickening and pericolic fat stranding. Angiography is usually not helpful because major arterial occlusion is rare. While sigmoidoscopy may reveal characteristic dark, hemor-rhagic mucosa, the risk of precipitating perforation is high. For this reason, sigmoidoscopy is relatively contraindicated in any patient with significant abdominal tenderness. Contrast studies

Blood consists of cells and their derivatives and a protein-rich fluid called plasma.

Blood cells and their derivatives include:  erythrocytes, also called red blood cells (RBCs), leukocytes, also known as white blood cells (WBCs), and thrombocytes, also termed platelets.

Plasma is the liquid extracellular material that imparts fluid properties to blood. The relative volume of cells and plasma in whole blood is approximately 45% and 55%,  respectively. The

volume of packed erythrocytes in a sample of blood is called the hematocrit. The hematocrit is measured by centrifuging a blood sample to which anticoagulants have been added, and then calculating the percentage of the centrifuge tube volume occupied by the erythrocytes compared with that of the whole blood. A normal hematocrit reading is about 39% to 50% in men and 35% to 45% in women; thus, 39% to 50% and 35% to 45% of the blood volume for men and women, respectively, consists of erythrocytes. Low hematocrit values often reﬂect reduced numbers of circulating erythrocytes (a condition called anemia) and may indicate significant blood loss caused by internal or external bleeding.

The median presenting leukocyte count is about 15,000/μL. Between 25 and 40% of patients have counts <5000/μL, and 20% have counts >100,000/μL. Fewer than 5% have no detectable leukemic cells in the blood. The morphology of the malignant cell varies in different subsets. In AML, the cytoplasm often contains primary (nonspecific) granules, and the nucleus shows fine, lacy chromatin with one or more nucleoli characteristic of immature cells. Abnormal rod-shaped granules called Auer rods are not uniformly present, but when they are, myeloid lineage is virtually certain (Fig. 132-1). Poor neutrophil function may be noted functionally by impaired phagocytosis and migration and morphologically by abnormal lobulation and deficient granulation.

Platelet counts <100,000/μL are found at diagnosis in ~75% of patients, and about 25% have counts <25,000/μL. Both morphologic and functional platelet abnormalities can be observed, including large and bizarre shapes with abnormal granulation and inability of platelets to aggregate or adhere normally to one another.

Pretreatment Evaluation Once the diagnosis of AML is suspected, a rapid evaluation and initiation of appropriate therapy should follow. In addition to clarifying the subtype of leukemia, initial studies should evaluate the overall functional integrity of the major organ systems, including the cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, and renal systems (Table 132-4). Factors that have prognostic significance, either for achieving CR or for predicting the duration of CR, should also be assessed before initiating treatment, including cytogenetics and molecular markers (see above). Leukemic cells should be obtained from all patients and cryopreserved for future use as new tests and therapeutics become available. All patients should be evaluated for infection.

Most patients are anemic and thrombocytopenic at presentation. Replacement of the appropriate blood components, if necessary, should begin promptly. Because qualitative platelet dysfunction or the presence of an infection may increase the likelihood of bleeding, evidence of hemorrhage justifies the immediate use of platelet transfusion, even if the platelet count is only moderately decreased.

Polycythemia is defined as an increase in the hemoglobin above normal. This increase may be real or only apparent because of a decrease in plasma volume (spurious or relative polycythemia). The term erythrocytosis may be used interchangeably with polycythemia, but some draw a distinction between them: erythrocytosis implies documentation of increased red cell mass, whereas polycythemia refers to any increase in red cells. Often patients with polycythemia are detected through an incidental finding of elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit levels. Concern that the hemoglobin level may be abnormally high is usually triggered at 170 g/L (17 g/dL) for men and 150 g/L (15 g/dL) for women. Hematocrit levels >50% in men or >45% in women may be abnormal. Hematocrits >60% in men and >55% in women are almost invariably associated with an increased red cell mass. Given that the machine that quantitates red cell parameters actually measures hemoglobin concentrations and calculates hematocrits, hemoglobin levels may be a better index.

Features of the clinical history that are useful in the differential diagnosis include smoking history; current living at high altitude; or a history of congenital heart disease, sleep apnea, or chronic lung disease.

Pulsatile emission of semen from the penis is generated by the reflex contraction of the bulbospongiosus muscle that forces semen from the base of the penis and out of the external urethral meatus. Bulbospongiosus muscle is innervated by somatic motor fibers carried in the pudendal nerve (S2–S4). Contraction of the internal urethral sphincter and periurethral smooth muscle, innervated by the sympathetic part of the visceral nervous system, prevents retrograde ejaculation into the bladder.

In the clinic

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a complex condition in which men are unable to initiate or maintain penile erection. When this affects erections during sleep, and with self-stimulation as well as with a partner, vascular and/or nerve impairment is present. This generalized type of ED increases with age and is recognized as a risk factor for coronary artery disease. It is frequently associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurological conditions including Parkinson’s disease, spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis, and as nerve damage from pelvic surgeries or radiation for pelvic malignancies. Low testosterone states can impair erections and consistently prevent sleep-induced erections. Medications including serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), thiazides and anti-androgens can also underlie ED. When only partnered erections are problematic, psychological factors underlie the dysfunction—the normal erections from sleep confirming healthy vascular and neurological function. Most cases of ED are multifactorial in etiology, and all markedly lessen quality of life and a person’s well-being and can lead to depression and low self-esteem as well as emotional and social isolation.

The prevalence of lifelong versus acquired erectile disorder is unknown. There is a strong age-related increase in both prevalence and incidence of problems with erection, particu- larly after age 50 years. Approximately 13%—21% of men ages 40—80 years complain of oc— casional problems with erections. Approximately 2% of men younger than age 40—50 years complain of frequent problems with erections, whereas 40%—50% of men older than 60—70 years may have significant problems with erections. About 20% of men fear erectile prob- lems on their first sexual experience, whereas approximately 8% experienced erectile prob- lems that hindered penetration during their first sexual experience.

Erectile failure on first sexual attempt has been found to be related to having sex with a previously unknown partner, concomitant use of drugs or alcohol, not wanting to have sex, and peer pressure. There is minimal evi—2t most of these problems spontaneously re- mit without professional intervention, but some men may continue to have episodic prob- lems. In contrast, acquired erectile disorder is often associated with biological factors such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Acquired erectile disorder is likely to be persistent in most men.

The natural history of lifelong erectile disorder is unknown. Clinical observation sup- ports the association of lifelong erectile disorder with psychological factors that are self- limiting or responsive to psychological interventions, whereas, as noted above, acquired erectile disorder is more likely to be related to biological factors and to be persistent. The incidence of erectile disorder increases with age. A minority of men diagnosed as having moderate erectile failure may experience spontaneous remission of symptoms without medical intervention. Distress associated with erectile disorder is lower in older men as compared with younger men.

Temperamental. Neurotic personality traits may be associated with erectile problems in col- lege students, and submissive personality traits may be associated with erectile problems in men age 40 years and older. Alexithymiu (i.e., deficits in cognitive processing of emotions) is common in men diagnosed with "psychogenic” erectile dysfunction. Erectile problems are common in men diagnosed with depression and posttraumatic stress disorder.

Course modifiers. Risk factors for acquired erectile disorder include age, smoking to- bacco, lack of physical exercise, diabetes, and decreased desire.

ERECTILE DYSFuNCTION Epidemiology Erectile dysfunction (ED) is not considered a normal part of the aging process. Nonetheless, it is associated with certain physiologic and psychological changes related to age. In the Massachusetts Male Aging Study (MMAS), a community-based survey of men age 40–70, 52% of responders reported some degree of ED. Complete ED occurred in 10% of respondents, moderate ED in 25%, and minimal ED in 17%. The incidence of moderate or severe ED more than doubled between the ages of 40 and 70. In the National Health and Social Life Survey (NHSLS), which included a sample of men and women age 18–59, 10% of men reported being unable to maintain an erection (corresponding to the proportion of men in the MMAS reporting severe ED). Incidence was highest among men in the age group 50–59 (21%) and men who were poor (14%), divorced (14%), and less educated (13%).

The incidence of ED is also higher among men with certain medical disorders, such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), heart disease, hypertension, decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, and diseases associated with general systemic inflammation (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). Cardiovascular disease and ED share etiologies as well as pathophysiology (e.g., endothelial dysfunction), and the degree of ED appears to correlate with the severity of cardiovascular disease. Consequently, ED represents a “sentinel symptom” in patients with occult cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease.

Smoking is also a significant risk factor in the development of ED. Medications used in treating diabetes or cardiovascular disease are additional risk factors (see below). There is a higher incidence of ED among men who have undergone radiation or surgery for prostate cancer and in those with a lower spinal cord injury. Psychological causes of ED include depression, anger, stress from unemployment, and other stress-related causes.

document (3) 

The initial evaluation of ED begins with a review of the patient’s medical, surgical, sexual, and psychosocial histories. The history should note whether the patient has experienced pelvic trauma, surgery, or radiation. In light of the increasing recognition of the relationship between lower urinary tract symptoms and ED, it is advisable to evaluate for the presence of symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction. Questions should focus on the onset of symptoms, the presence and duration of partial erections, and the progression of ED. A history of nocturnal or early morning erections is useful for distinguishing physiologic ED from psychogenic ED. Nocturnal erections occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and require intact neurologic and circulatory systems. Organic causes of ED generally are characterized by a gradual and persistent change in rigidity or the inability to sustain nocturnal, coital, or self-stimulated erections. The patient should be questioned about the presence of penile curvature or pain with coitus. It is also important to address libido, as decreased sexual drive and ED are sometimes the earliest signs of endocrine abnormalities (e.g., increased prolactin, decreased testosterone levels). It is useful to ask whether the problem is confined to coitus with one partner or also involves other partners; ED not uncommonly arises in association with new or extramarital sexual relationships. Situational ED, as opposed to consistent ED, suggests psychogenic causes. Ejaculation is much less commonly affected than erection, but questions should be asked about whether ejaculation is normal, premature, delayed, or absent. Relevant risk factors should be identified, such as diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease (CAD), and neurologic disorders. The patient’s surgical history should be explored with an emphasis on bowel, bladder, prostate, and vascular procedures. A complete drug history is also important. Social changes that may precipitate ED are also crucial to the evaluation, including health worries, spousal death, divorce, relationship difficulties, and financial concerns.

Because ED commonly involves a host of endothelial cell risk factors, men with ED report higher rates of overt and silent myocardial infarction. Therefore, ED in an otherwise asymptomatic male warrants consideration of other vascular disorders, including CAD.

The disease typically manifests with abrupt development of the nephrotic syndrome in an otherwise healthy child. There is no hypertension, and renal function is preserved in most of these patients. The protein loss usually is confined to smaller plasma proteins, chiefly albumin (selective proteinuria). The prognosis for children with this disorder is favorable. More than 90% of children respond to a short course of corticosteroid therapy; however, proteinuria recurs in more than two-thirds of the initial responders, some of whom become steroid-dependent with proteinuria recurring when steroids are withdrawn. Less than 5% develop chronic kidney disease after 25 years, and it is likely that most individuals in this subgroup had nephrotic syndrome caused by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis http://ebooksmedicine.net

not detected by biopsy. Because of its responsiveness to therapy in children, minimal-change disease must be differentiated from other causes of the nephrotic syndrome in nonresponders. Adults with this disease also respond to steroid therapy, but the response is slower and relapses are more common.

Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is characterized by sclerosis of some (but not all) glomeruli that involves only a part of each affected glomerulus. FSGS may be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to one of the following conditions:

HIV infection (HIV nephropathy). FSGS is seen in 5–10% of patients infected with HIV, but the incidence is decreasing with improved antiviral therapy.

Secondary to other forms of GN (e.g., IgA nephropathy)

Mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis is characterized by expansion of the mesangium, sometimes associated with mesangial hypercellularity; thin, single contoured capillary walls; and mesangial immune deposits. Clinically, it can present with varying degrees of proteinuria and, commonly, hematuria. Mesangioproliferative disease may be seen in IgA nephropathy, Plasmodium falciparum malaria, resolving postinfectious glomerulonephritis, and class II nephritis from lupus, all of which can have a similar histologic appearance. With these secondary entities excluded, the diagnosis of primary mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis is made in less than 15% of renal biopsies. As an immune-mediated renal lesion with deposits of IgM, C1q, and C3, the clinical course is variable. Patients with isolated hematuria may have a very benign course, and those with heavy proteinuria occasionally progress to renal failure. There is little agreement on treatment, but some clinical reports suggest benefit from use of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, steroid therapy, and even cytotoxic agents.

Nephrotic syndrome classically presents with heavy proteinuria, minimal hematuria, hypoalbuminemia, hypercholesterolemia, edema, and hypertension. If left undiagnosed or untreated, some of these syndromes will progressively damage enough glomeruli to cause a fall in GFR, producing renal failure. Multiple studies have noted that the higher the 24-h urine protein excretion, the more rapid is the decline in GFR.

Chronic or repeated infections with P. malariae (and possibly with other malarial species) may cause soluble immune complex injury to the renal glomeruli, resulting in the nephrotic syndrome. Other unidentified factors must contribute to this process since only a very small proportion of infected patients develop renal disease. The histologic appearance is that of focal or segmental glomerulonephritis with splitting of the capillary basement membrane. Subendothelial dense deposits are seen on electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence reveals deposits of complement and immunoglobulins; in samples of renal tissue from children, P. malariae antigens are often visible. A coarse-granular pattern of basement membrane immunofluorescent deposits (predominantly IgG3) with selective proteinuria carries a better prognosis than a fine-granular, predominantly IgG2 pattern with nonselective proteinuria. Quartan nephropathy usually responds poorly to treatment with either antimalarial agents or glucocorticoids and cytotoxic drugs.

It is possible that malaria-related immune dysregulation provokes infection with lymphoma viruses. Burkitt’s lymphoma is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus. The prevalence of this childhood tumor is high in malarious areas of Africa.

Studies of peripheral blood cells from infected individuals reveal cytotoxic T cells specific for viral peptides that can kill infected cells in vitro. In vivo, cytotoxic T cells traffic to sites of HIV replication, where they are thought to kill many productively infected cells before any infectious virus is released, thereby containing viral load at the quasistable levels that are characteristic of the asymptomatic period. Evidence for the clinical importance of the control of HIVinfected cells by CD8 cytotoxic T cells comes from studies relating the numbers and activity of CD8 T cells to viral load. There is also direct evidence from experiments in macaques infected with SIV that CD8 cytotoxic T cells control retrovirusinfected cells; treatment of infected animals with monoclonal antibodies that remove CD8 T cells is rapidly followed by a large increase in viral load.

In addition to direct cytotoxicity mediated by recognition of cells infected with virus, a variety of factors produced by CD4, CD8, and NK cells are important in antiviral immunity. Chemokines that bind CCR5, such as CCL5, CCL3, and CCL4, are released at the site of infection by CD8 T cells and inhibit virus spread by competing with R5 strains of HIV1 for the engagement of coreceptor CCR5, whereas factors still unknown compete with R4 strains for binding to CXCR4. Cytokines such as IFNα and IFNγ may also be involved in controlling virus spread.

Evidence shows that in addition to being a major target for HIV infection, CD4 T cells also have an important role in the host response to HIVinfected cells.

PD-1 on HIV-specific CD8+ T cells (see “Immune Activation, Inflammation, and HIV Pathogenesis,” above). As chronic immune activation persists, there are also systemic effects on CD8+ T cells, such that as a population they assume an abnormal phenotype characterized by expression of activation markers such as HLA-DR and CD38 with an absence of expression of the IL-2 receptor (CD25) and a reduced expression of the IL-7 receptor (CD127). In addition, CD8+ T cells lacking CD28 expression are increased in HIV disease, reflecting a skewed expansion of a less differentiated CD8+ T cell subset.

extensive death of CD4 T cells in the GALT that are killed by viral cytopathic effects (macrophages and dendritic cells appear more resistant to lysis by replicating virus). The depletion of immune cells in the gut might compound the rapid production of virus in the GALT by fostering increased immunecell activation due to barrier breakdown and translocation of constituents of the microbiota. Because of the high viral titers and preponderance of R5 strains during the acute phase of infection, the risk of viral transmission to uninfected contacts during this time is especially high.

The acute phase and its high viremia reside in virtually all patients once an adaptive immune response is established (see Fig. 13.33). Cytolytic CD8 T cells specific for viral antigens develop and kill HIVinfected cells, and virusspecific antibodies become detectable in the serum of those infected (seroconversion). The development of a CTL response results in early control of the virus, resulting in a sharp drop in viral titers and a rebound of CD4 Tcell counts. The level of virus that persists in blood plasma at this stage of infection, referred to as the viral set point, is usually a good indicator of future disease progression. At this point, the disease transitions to a clinically latent, or asymptomatic, phase marked by low viremia and slowly declining CD4 Tcell numbers, typically over several years. During this time the virus continues to actively replicate, but it is held in check, principally by HIVspecific CD8 T cells and antibodies.

responses that would be expected to be most efficient in eliminating virus-infected cells; however, the restriction is generally incomplete as viral replication persists at relatively high levels in the majority of individuals. In addition to viral escape from CTLs through high rates of mutation, it is thought that the initially strong response becomes qualitatively dysfunctional owing to the overwhelming immune activation resulting from persistent viral replication, similar to the exhaustion of CD8+ CTLs that has been reported in the murine model of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. Several studies have indicated that exhaustion of HIV-specific CD8+

progression of HIV infection. The high rate of virus replication associated with inevitable mutations also contributes to the inability of antibody to neutralize the autologous virus and thus to contain the virus quasispecies present in an individual at any given time. Extensive analyses of sequential HIV isolates and host responses have demonstrated that viral escape from B cell and CD8+ T cell epitopes occurs early after infection and allows the virus to stay one step ahead of effective immune responses. Virus-specific CD8+ CTLs expand greatly during primary HIV infection, and likely represent the high-affinity responses that would be

Escape of HIV from Effective Immune System Control Inherent to the establishment of chronicity of HIV infection is the ability of the virus to evade adequate control and elimination by both the cellular and humoral limbs of the immune system. There are a number of mechanisms whereby the virus accomplishes this evasion. Paramount among these is the establishment of a sustained level of replication associated with the generation of viral diversity via mutation and recombination. The selection of mutants that escape control by CD8+ cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) is critical to the propagation and progression of HIV infection.

Heart failure is an increasingly common cause of death, particularly in the elderly. Most patients who reach what has recently been categorized as stage D, or refractory end-stage heart failure, are appropriately treated with compassionate end-of-life care. A subset of such patients who are younger and without significant comorbidities can be considered as candidates for heart transplantation. Exact criteria vary in different centers but generally take into consideration the patient’s physiologic age and the existence of comorbidities such as peripheral or cerebrovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, cancer, or chronic infection.

A registry organized by the ISHLT has tracked worldwide and

U.S. survival rates after heart transplantation since 1982. The most recent update reveals survival rates of 83% and 76% 1 and 3 years after transplantation, respectively, or a posttransplantation “half-life” of 10.00 years (Fig. 281-1). The quality of life of survivors is generally excellent, with well over 90% of patients in the registry returning to normal and unrestricted function after transplantation.

JP is a 33-year-old woman who presents with complaints of fatigue requiring daytime naps, weight gain, cold intoler-ance, and muscle weakness for the last few months. These complaints are new since she used to always feel “hot,” noted difficulty sleeping, and could eat anything that she wanted without gaining weight. She also would like to become preg-nant in the near future. Because of poor medication adherence to methimazole and propranolol, she received radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, developed hypothyroidism, and was started on levothyroxine 100 mcg daily. Other medications include calcium carbonate three times daily to “protect her bones” and omeprazole for “heartburn.” On physical exami-nation, her blood pressure is 130/89 mm Hg with a pulse of 50 bpm. Her weight is 136 lb (61.8 kg), an increase of 10 lb (4.5 kg) in the last year. Her thyroid gland is not palpable and her reflexes are delayed. Laboratory findings include a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 24.9 μIU/mL (normal 0.45–4.12 μIU/mL) and a free thyroxine level of 8 pmol/L (normal 10–18 pmol/L). Evaluate the management of her past history of hyperthyroidism and assess her current thyroid status. Identify your treatment recommendations to maximize control of her current thyroid status.

The normal thyroid gland secretes sufficient amounts of the thyroid hormones—triiodothyronine (T3) and tetraiodothyronine (T4, thyroxine)—to normalize growth and development, body temperature, and energy levels. These hormones contain 59% and 65% (respectively) of iodine as an essential part of the molecule. Calcitonin, the second type of thyroid hormone, is important in the regulation of calcium metabolism and is discussed in Chapter 42.

The recommended daily adult iodide (I−)† intake is 150 mcg (200 mcg during pregnancy and lactation and up to 250 mcg for children).

If thyroid function is preserved, most goiters are asymptomatic. Examination of a diffuse goiter reveals a symmetrically enlarged, nontender, generally soft gland without palpable nodules. Goiter is defined, somewhat arbitrarily, as a lateral lobe with a volume greater than the thumb of the individual being examined. If the thyroid is markedly enlarged, it can cause tracheal or esophageal compression. These features are unusual, however, in the absence of nodular disease and fibrosis. Substernal goiter may obstruct the thoracic inlet. Pemberton’s sign refers to symptoms of faintness with evidence of facial congestion and external jugular venous obstruction when the arms are raised above the head, a maneuver that draws the thyroid into the thoracic inlet. Respiratory flow measurements and CT or MRI should be used to evaluate substernal goiter in patients with obstruc-2301 tive signs or symptoms.

Thyroid function tests should be performed in all patients with goiter to exclude thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism. It is not unusual, particularly in iodine deficiency, to find a low total T4, with normal T3 and TSH, reflecting enhanced T4 → T3 conversion. A low TSH with a normal free T3 and free T4, particularly in older patients, suggests the possibility of thyroid autonomy or undiagnosed Graves’ disease, and is termed subclinical thyrotoxicosis. The benefit of treatment (typically with radioiodine) in subclinical thyrotoxicosis, versus follow-up and implementing treatment if free T3 or free T4 levels become abnormal, is unclear, but treatment is increasingly recommended in the elderly to reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation and bone loss. TPO antibodies may be useful to identify patients at increased risk of autoimmune thyroid disease. Low urinary iodine levels (<50 μg/L) support a diagnosis of iodine deficiency. Thyroid scanning is not generally necessary but will reveal increased uptake in iodine deficiency and most cases of dyshormonogenesis. Ultrasound is not generally indicated in the evaluation of diffuse goiter unless a nodule is palpable on physical examination.

The first and earliest is destruction-induced thyrotoxicosis with symptoms from excessive release of hormone from glandular disruption. The onset is abrupt, and a small, painless goiter is common. Although there may be many symptoms, only fatigue and palpitations are more frequent in thyrotoxic women com pared with normal controls. This thyrotoxic phase usually lasts only a few months. hionamides are inefective, and if symp toms are severe, a 3-blocking agent may be given. he second and usually later phase between 4 and 8 months postpartum is hypothyroidism from thyroiditis. hyromegaly and other symp toms are common and more prominent than during the thyro toxic phase. hyroxine replacement at doses of25 to 75 �g/d is typically given for 6 to 12 months.

Stagnaro-Green and associates (20 11 b) reported postpartum surveillance results in 4562 Italian gravidas who had been screened for thyroid disease in pregnancy. Serum TSH and anti-TPO antibody levels were measured again at 6 and 12 months. Overall, two thirds of 169 women (3.9 percent) with postpartum thyroiditis were identiied to have hypothyroidism only. The other third were diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. Only 14 percent of all women demonstrated the "classic" biphasic progression described above. These indings are consistent with data compiled from 20 other studies between 1982 and 2008 (Stagnaro-Green, 2012a).

Importantly, women who experience either type of postpartum thyroiditis have a 20-to 30-percent risk of eventually developing permanent hypothyroidism, and the annual progression rate is 3.6 percent (Nathan, 2014). Women at greater risk for developing hypothyroidism are those with higher titers of thyroid antibodies and higher TSH levels during the initial hypothyroid phase. Others may develop subclinical disease, but half of those with thyroiditis who are positive for TPO antibodies develop permanent hypothyroidism by 6 to 7 years (Stagnaro-Green,r2012a).

Clinical Features Symptoms of thyrotoxicosis include fatigue, diarrhea, heat intolerance, palpitations, dyspnea, nervousness, and weight loss. In young patients there may be paradoxical weight gain from an increased appetite. Thyrotoxicosis may cause vomiting in pregnant women, which may be confused with hyperemesis gravidarum (50). Tachycardia, lid lag, tremor, proximal muscle weakness, and warm moist skin are classic physical findings. The most dramatic physical changes are ophthalmologic and include lid retraction, periorbital edema, and proptosis. These eye findings occur in less than one-third of women. In elderly adults, symptoms are often more subtle, with presentations of unexplained weight loss, atrial fibrillation, or new onset angina pectoris. Menstrual abnormalities span from regular menses to light ﬂow to anovulatory menses and associated infertility. Goiter is common in younger women with Graves disease, but may be absent in older women. Toxic nodular goiter is associated with nonhomogeneous glandular enlargement, whereas in subacute thyroiditis the gland is tender, hard, and enlarged.

Diagnosis Most thyrotoxic patients have elevated total and free T4 and T3 concentrations (measured by radioimmune assay). In thyrotoxicosis, serum TSH concentrations are virtually undetectable, even with very sensitive assays (sensitivity measured to 0.1 units). Sensitive serum TSH measurements may aid in the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. Radioiodine uptake scans are useful in the differential diagnosis of established hyperthyroidism. Scans with homogeneous uptake of radioactive iodine are suggestive of Graves disease, whereas heterogeneous tracer uptake is suggestive of a diagnosis of toxic nodular goiter. Thyroiditis and medication-induced thyrotoxicosis have diminished glandular radioisotope concentration.

Voiding difficulties are frequent in preschool age children due todelay in maturation of bladder and micturition pathways. Normal micturition and continence rely on structural UT integrity,neurologic maturation, and coordination between somatic andautonomic nervous system units, including the central nervoussystem, spinal cord pathways, nerves innervating the bladder/urinary sphincter, and the autonomic system. Daytime continence is usually achieved before nighttime continence. Mostchildren are dry, day and night, by 4 to 5 years of age. Nocturnalenuresis is the involuntary loss of urine during sleep. Childrenwith primary enuresis have never had a prolonged (usually >3months) span of nighttime continence. Up to 10% of 5-year-oldchildren have primary enuresis with 15% spontaneous resolution per year. Boys are affected more than girls with increasedincidence in families (40% at 6 years of age if one affected parent, 70% if two affected parents). Secondary enuresis involvesloss of nighttime control after an extended period of drynessand generally requires evaluation to uncover the cause.

Decision-Making Algorithm Available @ StudentConsult.com Clinical Manifestations

Dysfunctional voiding (DV) may manifest as incontinence, fre- quency, urgency, hesitancy, dysuria, lower abdominal pain, or recurrent UTI. Symptoms may vary over time and be associatedwith obvious neurologic problems (spinal cord injury, encephalitis), constipation, and/or behavioral problems. DV symptomsmay vary, depending on recent UTI or changes in family orschool life/stressors. The majority of children with DV are anatomically, neurologically, and psychologically normal.

Evaluation for DV may be performed at any age, but isolatedurinary incontinence in an otherwise normal child is notusually evaluated until 5 years of age. A urinalysis and urineculture should be done to exclude occult infection and renal disease. Children with daytime incontinence should undergorenal/bladder ultrasound to exclude structural abnormalities. Urodynamic evaluation is typically reserved for childrenwith a suspicion of neurogenic bladder or known neurologicetiology.

A frequency/volume bladder chart provides vital information about bladder function that is not provided by formal urodynamics studies: 24-hour urinary output, the total number of daily voids, number of nighttime voids, the average voided volume, and the functional bladder capacity (largest volume voided in normal daily life). This information allows the clinician to confirm reports of urinary frequency with objective data and to determine whether part of the patient’s problem is an abnormally high (or low) urinary output. The chart can be used to calculate the volume of urine generated in nighttime hours versus daytime hours. Nighttime volume is calculated by adding output from voids that occur after the woman has fallen asleep for the night and the first morning void on awakening for the day. Older women sometimes have a marked shift in urine production, with more than half of their urine output generated during sleeping hours (Fig. 26.4). Demonstrating this on the voiding diary may lead to further treatment options.

Urinalysis Examination of the urine by dipstick testing and microscopy is done to exclude infection, hematuria, and metabolic abnormalities. Hematuria cannot be diagnosed on the results of a dipstick test alone; confirmation by microscopic evaluation is mandatory.

Figure 26.4 Voiding diary (also called bladder chart). Daytime frequency is seven. The patient has nocturia (gets up to void two times during sleeping hours) and also has nocturnal polyuria (an increased proportion of the 24-hour output occurs at night; note that nighttime urine output excludes the last void before sleep but includes the first void of the morning). She has urge incontinence, likely caused by the relatively larger bladder volumes voided at night, which in turn may be related to her greater ﬂuid, caffeine, and alcohol consumption in the evening.

The diagnosis of UTI in infants and young children requires the presence of both pyuria and at least 50,000 CFU/mL of a single pathogenic organism. For older children and adolescents, >100,000 CFU/mL indicates infection. Urine samples for urinalysis should be examined promptly (within 20 minutes) or refrigerated until cultured. Urine obtained by midstream, clean-catch technique for older children and adolescents is an appropriate collection method, whereas transurethral catheterization is the appropriate method for younger children and infants in which antibiotics are being started. Perineal bags for urine collection are prone to contamination and are not recommended for urine collection for culture. If there

Urinalysis showing pyuria (leukocyturia of >10 white blood cells [WBCs]/mm3) suggests infection, but also is consistent with urethritis, vaginitis, nephrolithiasis, glomerulonephritis, and interstitial nephritis. Urinary dipstick tests that combine both the leukocyte esterase and nitrite (or positive leukocyte esterase and positive microscopy for bacteria) have sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 99% for detecting a UTI. Either test used alone has poor sensitivity.

Ultrasonography of the bladder and kidneys is recommended for infants with febrile UTIs to exclude structural abnormalities or detect hydronephrosis. Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) is indicated if the ultrasound is abnormal (hydronephrosis, scarring, or other findings to suggest obstruction or congenital abnormality). Vesicoureteral reflux is the most common abnormality found and is ranked from grade I (ureter only) to grade V (complete gross dilation of the ureter and obliteration of caliceal and pelvic anatomy) (see Chapter 167). A technetium-99m DMSA scan can identify acute pyelonephritis and is most useful to define renal scarring as a late effect of UTI.

Treatment begins with treating any diagnosed underlying organic causes of enuresis. Elimination of underlying chronic constipation is often curative. For a child whose enuresis is not associated with an identifiable disorder, all therapies must be considered in terms of cost in time, money, disruption to the family, the treatment’s known success rate, and the child’s likelihood to recover from the condition without treatment. The most commonly used treatment options are conditioning therapy and pharmacotherapy. The clinician can also assist the family in making a plan to help the child cope with this problem until it is resolved. Many children have to live with enuresis for months to years before a cure is achieved; a few children have symptoms into adulthood. A plan for handling wet garments and linens in a nonhumiliating and hygienic manner preserves the child’s self-esteem. The child should take as much responsibility as he or she is able, depending on age, development, and family culture.

The most widely used conditioning therapy for nocturnal enuresis is the enuresis alarm. Enuresis alarms have an initial success rate of 70% with a relapse rate of 10%. The alarm is worn on the wrist or clipped onto the pajama and has a probe that is placed in the underpants or pajamas in front of the urethra. The alarm sounds when the first drop of urine contacts the probe. The child is instructed to get up and finish voiding in the bathroom when the alarm sounds. After 3 to 5 months, 70% of children are dry through the night.

In addition to radiation injury, important factors in the development of the fulminant syndrome are the age of the patient (many are younger than 5 years old). In an attempt to address the long-term cognitive sequela of cranial radiation in children with leukemia, Pui and coworkers conducted a study and found that it could be safely omitted if all other aspects of therapy have been optimized.

Involvement of the Nervous System in Systemic Lymphoma

Extradural compression of the spinal cord or cauda equina is the most common neurologic complication of all types of lymphoma, the result of extension from vertebrae or paravertebral lymph nodes. Treatment is with radiation to the affected portion of the neuraxis or, if the compression is very acute and causing serious myelopathy, surgical decompression. Systemic lymphoma rarely metastasizes to the brain. In a review of more than 100 autopsies at the Mallory Institute of Pathology, our colleague R.D. Adams observed only a half-dozen instances where patients with lymphomas had deposits of tumor cells in the brain and in none of these cases were they from multiple myeloma (Sparling et al). In the series of Levitt and associates, comprising 592 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, there were only 8 with intracerebral metastases.

in the bone formation. Evidence of bony destruction is also common. The diagnosis can be made by a percutaneous needle biopsy or an incisional biopsy.	 These tumors have a strong propensity to metastasize to the lungs and skeleton; patient survival rates are thus only 50% or less at 3 years. Increasing tumor size is associated with decreasing survival. Treatment has improved sig-nificantly and now consists of multiagent chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. Patients are typically treated preoperatively with chemotherapy and reevaluated with radiologic imaging. When residual disease is identified, sur-gical resection and reconstruction are performed

spinal cord compression from metastatic tumor have better outcomes with decompres-sive surgery and radiotherapy compared to radiotherapy alone.70 Patients with radiosensitive tumors, such as multiple myeloma and lymphoma, are excluded from this group. Another impor-tant tool in assessing these patients is the SINS (Spinal Instabil-ity Neoplastic Score). This scale grades the utility of operative intervention in metastatic cancer to the spine on the basis of pain, deformity, location, type of bone lesion, integrity of verte-bral body, and posterior element involvement.71Primary Tumors Hemangiomas are benign tumors found in 10% of people at autopsy.

The primary tumor may be resected en bloc with adjacent involved organs (e.g., distal pancreas, transverse colon, or spleen) during the course of curative gastrectomy. Palliative gastrectomy may be indicated

In those instances when a diagnosis of labor cannot be established with certainty, observation for a longer period is often wise. Women who present to Parkland Hospital for labor 24°/7 ,. .

symptoms at weeks gestatIon or greater are routmely evaluated in a labor triage unit contiguous to our labor and delivery unit. All women in the triage area are evaluated by nurse practitioners and certiied nurse midwives using written protocols. Women with uncomplicated pregnancies with intact membranes and cervical dilation < 4 cm receive continuous external fetal monitoring for up to 2 hours. Women diagnosed with labor by either cervical change or persistent uterine contractions are admitted. After review by a physician, women without cervical change or with abatement of contractions return home with a diagnosis of false labor. In a recent study, a total of 3949 women with uncomplicated pregnancies between and 416r weeks' gestation were diagnosed with false labor. The mean inteval from hospital discharge to when they again presented was 4.9 days (Nelson, 2017). Within this protocol, hospital discharge with false labor at term was not associated with higher rates of adverse neonatal outcomes or cesarean delivery. he American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2016a) has endorsed hospital-based obstetrical triage units.

Maternal blood pressure, temperature, pulse, and respiratory rate are recorded. Fetal heart rate is evaluated using a portable Doppler device, sonography, or fetoscope. The pregnancy record is promptly reviewed to identiY complications. Problems identiied or anticipated during prenatal care should be displayed prominently in the pregnancy record. Most often, unless there has been bleeding in excess of bloody show, a cervical examination is performed. he gloved index and second ingers are introduced into the vagina while avoiding the anal region.

During prenatal care, the woman is instructed to be aware of luid leakage from the vagina and to report such an event promptly. Rupture of the membranes is signiicant for three reasons. First, if the presenting part is not ixed in the pelvis, the umbilical cord can prolapse and be compressed. Second, labor is likely to begin soon if the pregnancy is at or near term.

Breast cancer complicates 1 in 3,000 pregnancies (129,130). It is the second most common malignancy seen in association with pregnancy, surpassed only by cervical cancer. Initial studies suggested a significantly worse prognosis for patients first diagnosed during pregnancy, but data indicate that the hormonal changes associated with pregnancy seem to have little, if any, inﬂuence on prognosis. When pregnant patients are matched stage for stage with nonpregnant patients, survival rates seem equivalent (131). Patients typically present with a painless mass. Up to 60% will have concurrent lymph node involvement. The evaluation includes imaging with ultrasonography and mammography, which, although controversial, expose the fetus to less than 0.02 cGy of radiation when used with proper abdominal shielding (132). If biopsy is warranted, the procedure can be performed safely and should not be delayed until after delivery. Needle biopsy is safe and easily accomplished in the office setting.

The treatment of breast cancer in pregnant women must be highly individualized. Considerations include the patient’s age and desire to continue the pregnancy. The overall prognosis should be considered, especially when axillary lymph nodes are involved, because adjuvant chemotherapy can be teratogenic or lethal to the fetus during the first trimester, but may be given later in the pregnancy. It is believed that interruption of pregnancy does not alter the prognosis for patients with potentially curable breast cancer.

Following are generalized recommendations for treatment of pregnant women with breast cancer: 1.

Recommended routine tests at the first prenatal encounter are listed in Table 9-1. Initial blood tests include a complete blood count, a determination of blood type with h status, and an antibody screen. The Institute of Medicine recommends universal human immunodeiciency virus (HIV) testing, with patient notiication and right of refusal, as a routine part of prenatal care. The CDC (Branson, 2006) as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (20 16f, 2017) continue to support this practice. If a woman declines testing, this is recorded in the prenatal record. All pregnant women are also screened for hepatitis B virus infection, syphilis, and immunity to rubella at the initial visit. Based on their prospective investigation of 1000 women, Murray and coworkers (2002) concluded that in the absence of hypertension, routine urinalysis beyond the irst prenatal visit was not necessary. A urine culture is recommended by most because treating bacteruria signiicantly reduces the likelihood of developing symptomatic urinary tract infections in pregnancy (Chap. 53, p. 1026).

Chlamydia trachomatis is isolated from the cervix in 2 to 13 percent of pregnant women. he American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017) recommend that all women be screened for chlamydia during the irst prenatal visit, with additional third-trimester testing for those at increased risk. Risk factors include unmarried status, recent change in sexual partner or multiple concurrent partners, age younger than 25 years, inner-city residence, history or presence of other sexually transmitted diseases, and little or no prenatal care. For those testing positive, treatment described in Chapter 65 (p. 1240) is followed by a second testing-a test of cure-3 to 4 weeks after treatment completion.

Chronic ectopic pregnancy is a condition in which the pregnancy does not completely resorb during expectant management. The condition arises when there is persistence of the chorionic villi with bleeding into the tubal wall, which is distended slowly and does not rupture. It may arise from chronic bleeding from the fimbriated end of the fallopian tube with subsequent tamponade. In a series of 50 patients with a chronic ectopic pregnancy, pain was present in 86%, vaginal bleeding was present in 68%, and both symptoms were present in 58% (234). Ninety percent of the patients had amenorrhea ranging from 5 to 16 weeks (mean, 9.6 weeks). Most patients develop a pelvic mass that usually is symptomatic. The β-hCG level usually is low but may be absent; ultrasonography may be helpful in the diagnosis; rarely, bowel involvement or ureteral compression or obstruction exists (234,235).

This condition is treated surgically with removal of the affected tube. Often, the ovary must be removed because there is inﬂammation with subsequent adhesion development. A hematoma may be present secondary to chronic bleeding.

Cervical Pregnancy The incidence of cervical pregnancy in the United States ranges from

Pregnancy 1 in 2,400 to 1 in 50,000 pregnancies and accounts for less than 1% of ectopic pregnancies (236,237). The cause of cervical ectopic pregnancies is unknown and the rare occurrence prevents identification of known risk factors. The incidence does appear to be higher with in vitro fertilization procedures, accounting for 3.7% of IVF-related ectopic pregnancies (238).

The clinical criteria for diagnosing a cervical pregnancy include the following findings (239): 1.

Uterus is smaller than the surrounding distended cervix; 2.

3.

4.

Profuse bleeding on manipulation of cervix.

Patients classically present with painless vaginal bleeding, but reports of associated cramping and pain are published (240).

A 32-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with weakness and hypokalemia. The patient had been very healthy until 2 months previously when he developed intermittent leg weakness. His review of systems was otherwise negative. He denied drug or laxative abuse and was on no medications. Past medical history was unremarkable, with no history of neuromuscular disease. Family history was notable for a sister with thyroid disease. Physical examination was notable only for reduced deep tendon reflexes.

This patient developed hypokalemia due to a redistribution of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular compartments; this pathophysiology was readily apparent following calculation of the TTKG. The TTKG is calculated as (P × U )/(P ×

U ). The expected values for the TTKG are <3 in the presence of hypokalemia and >7–8 in the presence of hyperkalemia (see also Case 2 and Case 8). Alternatively, a urinary K+-to-creatinine ratio of >13 mmol/g creatinine (>1.5 mmol/mmol creatinine) is compatible with excessive renal K+ excretion. In this case, the calculated TTKG was 2.5, consistent with appropriate renal conservation of K+ and a nonrenal cause for hypokalemia. In the absence of significant gastrointestinal loss of K+, the patient was diagnosed with a “redistributive” subtype of hypokalemia.

The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly.

The plasma Na+ concentration on admission was 113 meq/L, with a creatinine of 2.35 (Table 64e-1). At hospital hour 7, the plasma Na+ concentration was 120 meq/L, potassium 5.4 meq/L, chloride 90 64e-5 meq/L, bicarbonate 22 meq/L, BUN 32 mg/dL, creatinine 2.02 mg/dL, glucose 89 mg/dL, total protein 5.0, and albumin 1.9. The hematocrit was 33.9, white count 7.6, and platelets 405. A morning cortisol was 19.5, with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 1.7. The patient was treated with 1 μg of intravenous DDAVP, along with 75 mL/h of intravenous half-normal saline. After the plasma Na+ concentration dropped to 116 meq/L, intravenous fluid was switched to normal saline at the same infusion rate. The subsequent results are shown in Table 64e-1.

This patient presented with hypovolemic hyponatremia and a “prerenal” reduction in GFR, with an increase in serum creatinine. She had experienced diarrhea for some time and manifested an orthostatic tachycardia after a liter of normal saline. As expected for hypovolemic hyponatremia, the urine Na+ concentration was <20 meq/L in the absence of congestive heart failure or other causes of hypervolemic hyponatremia, and she responded to saline hydration with an increase in plasma Na+ concentration and a decrease in creatinine.

Hemodialysis is the most effective and reliable method to reduce plasma K+ concentration; peritoneal dialysis is considerably less effective. Patients with acute kidney injury require temporary, urgent venous access for hemodialysis, with the attendant risks; in contrast, patients with ESRD or advanced chronic kidney disease may have a preexisting venous access. The amount of K+ removed during hemodialysis depends on the relative distribution of K+ between ICF and ECF (potentially affected by prior therapy for hyperkalemia), the type and surface area of the dialyzer used, dialysate and blood flow rates, dialysate flow rate, dialysis duration, and the plasma-to-dialysate K+ gradient.

Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalances and Acid-Base Disturbances: Case Examples David B. Mount, Thomas D. DuBose, Jr. CASE 1 64e

A 23-year-old woman was admitted with a 3-day history of fever, cough productive of blood-tinged sputum, confusion, and orthostasis. Past medical history included type 1 diabetes mellitus. A physical examination in the emergency department indicated postural hypo-tension, tachycardia, and Kussmaul respiration. The breath was noted to smell of “acetone.” Examination of the thorax suggested consolidation in the right lower lobe.

The pain of herniated intervertebral disc varies in severity from a mild aching discomfort to severe knife-like stabs that radiate the length of the leg and are superimposed on a constant intense ache. Sciatic pain is perceived by the patient as originating deep in the buttock and radiating to the posterolateral thigh; it may progress to the calf and ankle—to the medial malleolus (L4), lateral malleolus (L5), or heel (S1). Distal radiation to the foot is infrequent and should raise concern of an alternative process. Abortive forms of sciatica may produce aching discomfort only in the lower buttock or proximal thigh and occasionally only in the lower hamstring or upper calf. With the most severe pain, the patient is forced to stay in bed, avoiding the slightest movement; a cough, sneeze, or strain is intolerable. The most comfortable position is lying on the back with legs flexed at the knees and hips and the shoulders raised on pillows to obliterate the lumbar lordosis. For some patients, a lateral decubitus position is more comfortable. Free fragments of disc that find their way to a lateral and posterior position in the spinal canal may produce the opposite situation, one whereby the patient is unable to extend the spine and lie supine. Sitting and standing up from a sitting position are particularly painful. It is surprising to patients that a lumbar disc protrusion may cause little or no back pain. As a corollary, the presence of lumbar disc disease, even frank rupture, bears an inconsistent relationship to low back pain, as already emphasized.

In cases of root compression, pain is also characteristically provoked by pressure along the course of the sciatic nerve at the classic points of Valleix (sciatic notch, retrotrochanteric gutter, posterior surface of thigh, and head of fibula). Pressure at one point may cause radiation of pain and tingling down the leg.

The likely cause of a herniated lumbar disc is a flexion injury, but a considerable proportion of patients do not recall a traumatic episode. Degeneration of the nucleus pulposus, the posterior longitudinal ligaments, and the annulus fibrosus may have taken place silently or have been manifest by mild, recurrent lumbar ache. A sneeze, lurch, or other trivial movement may then cause the nucleus pulposus to prolapse, pushing the frayed and weakened annulus posteriorly. A fragment of the nucleus protrudes through a tear in the annulus, usually to one side or the other (sometimes in the midline), where it impinges on a root or roots and cause the characteristic sciatic or other radicular pain and neurologic signs. In more severe cases of disc rupture, a small piece of the nucleus becomes entirely extruded as a “free fragment” and is mobile enough to affect a root at an adjacent level or to give rise to unusual positional features of radicular pain. Large protrusions cause pain by compressing the adjacent root against the articular apophysis or lamina. The protruded material may shrink, presumably from desiccation, but often there is continued chronic irritation of the root or later posterior osteophyte formation.

Clinical syndrome of lumbar disc herniation The fully developed syndrome of the common herniated (the terms ruptured and prolapsed are used equivalently) intervertebral lower lumbar disc consists of (1) pain in the sacroiliac region, radiating into the buttock, thigh, and the calf, a symptom termed sciatica; (2) a stiff or unnatural spinal posture; and often (3) some combination of paresthesia, weakness, and reflex impairment.

Dx:

Acute peripheral vestibulopathy demonstrates the following:

An abnormal vestibulo-ocular reﬂex (VOR) as determined by a bedside head impulse test (i.e., rapid head rotation from lateral to center while staring at the examiner’s nose).

A predominantly horizontal nystagmus that always beats in one direction, opposite the lesion.

No vertical eye misalignment by alternate cover testing.

If patients are “high risk” (i.e., if they have atypical eye findings or any neurologic symptoms or signs, cannot stand independently, have head or neck pain, are > 50 years of age, or have one or more stroke risk factors), they should be imaged by MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging.

For low-risk patients, consider caloric testing as ancillary support for the diagnosis.

Labyrinthitis (with auditory symptoms) is mimicked by lateral pontine/ cerebellar stroke (AICA arterial territory). Vestibular neuritis (without auditory symptoms) is mimicked by lateral medullary/cerebellar stroke (PICA arterial territory).

Tx: Acute treatment consists of corticosteroids given < 72 hours after symptom onset and vestibular sedatives (e.g., meclizine). The condition usually subsides spontaneously within weeks to months. Once the hyperacute stage has passed, cautious engagement in normal physical activities and exercise should be encouraged.

A cause of recurrent vertigo with auditory symptoms that affects at least 1 in 500 in the United States. More common among females.

Hx/PE: Presents with recurrent episodes of severe vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, or ear fullness, often lasting hours to days. Nausea and vomiting are typical. Patients progressively lose low-frequency hearing over years and may become deaf on the affected side.

Herniation of a lower cervical disk is a common cause of pain or tingling in the neck, shoulder, arm, or hand. Neck pain, stiffness, and a range of motion limited by pain are the usual manifestations. Herniated cervical disks are responsible for ~25% of cervical radiculopathies. Extension and lateral rotation of the neck narrow the ipsilateral intervertebral foramen and may reproduce radicular symptoms (Spurling’s sign). In young adults, acute nerve root compression from a ruptured cervical disk is often due to trauma. Cervical disk herniations are usually posterolateral near the lateral recess. Typical patterns

lateral recess. Typical patterns of reflex, sensory, and motor changes that accompany cervical nerve root lesions are summarized in Table 22-4. Although the classic patterns are clinically helpful, there are numerous exceptions because there is overlap in sensory function between adjacent nerve roots, symptoms and signs may be evident in only part of the injured nerve root territory, and (3) the location of pain is the most variable of the clinical features.

(BPH) refers to the histological findings of smooth muscle and fibroblast/epithelial cell pro-liferation in the transition zone of the prostate. Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) may be secondary to benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) causing progressive bladder outlet obstruc-tion but may also be due to numerous other conditions (e.g., urethral stricture, infection, overactive or neurogenic bladder, malignancy). Although some male patients with LUTS may have BPE, not all patients with an enlarged prostate have LUTS. The prevalence of LUTS attributed to BPH in men over the age of 50 is estimated at

injured through iatrogenic and classic trau-matic mechanisms. Indications for bladder imaging include gross hematuria in the setting of injuries with a correlation for bladder injury. The most common clinical scenario is gross hematuria associated with a pelvic fracture, which is associated with a 29% chance of bladder laceration.60 Diagnosis of bladder injuries requires either a CT cystogram or a fluoroscopic cysto-gram. The sensitivities and specificities of these two modalities are similar.61,62 The bladder should be filled with approximately 300 cc of contrast for either of these imaging modalities.

Interstitial cystitis (IC)/bladder pain syndrome occurs more often in women than men. Most patients are between 40 and 60 years of age. In 2002, painful bladder disorders were defined by the International Continence Society (ICS) in a set of new recommendations (109). The most widely used definition, painful bladder syndrome (PBS) is described as a clinical syndrome (i.e., a complex of symptoms) consisting of “suprapubic pain related to bladder filling, accompanied by other symptoms, such as increased daytime and nighttime frequency in the absence of proven infection or other obvious pathology.” By comparison, the term “interstitial cystitis” refers to patients who have PBS symptoms, but who also have “typical cystoscopic and histological features” during bladder hydrodistension (109).

The etiology of IC/PBS is unknown, but several hypotheses exist. A defective glycosaminoglycan (GAG) epithelial layer, which allows irritating substances in the urine to penetrate the urothelium to the subepithelial nerve endings, may be responsible for the syndrome (110). This theoretical mechanism is based on the fact that many IC sufferers have a positive potassium diffusion test and are sensitive to certain foods and beverages. Immunological mechanisms were proposed because abnormal mast cell activity, increased substance P expressing nerve fibers and increased nerve growth factor, were all found in bladder biopsies of IC affected individuals (110). Autoimmune mechanisms may be responsible in some individuals given that there is a higher incidence of systemic lupus erythematosus, allergies, inﬂammatory bowel and irritable bowel disease, and fibromyalgia in patients with bladder symptoms. Another possible mechanism is central sensitization with altered sympathetic and hypothalamic adrenal axis, substantiated by the existence of “phantom” bladder pain even after surgical removal of the bladder (110).

Symptoms include severe and disabling urinary frequency and urgency, nocturia, and occasional dysuria and hematuria. Suprapubic, pelvic, urethral, vaginal, vulvar, or perineal pain is common and can be relieved to some extent by emptying of the bladder (111).

Variability in body proportions occurs from fetal to adultlife. Newborns’ heads are significantly larger in proportion tothe rest of their body. This difference gradually disappears.Certain growth disturbances result in characteristic changesin the proportional sizes of the trunk, extremities, and head.Patterns requiring further assessment are summarized inTable 6-1.

Evaluating a child over time, coupled with a careful history and physical examination, helps determine whether the growth pattern is normal or abnormal. Parental heights may be useful when deciding whether to proceed with a further evaluation. Children, in general, follow their parents’ growth pattern, although there are many exceptions.

For a girl, midparental height is calculated as follows: −2.5 2

For a boy, midparental height is calculated as follows: +2.5 2

Actual growth depends on too many variables to makean accurate prediction from midparental height determination for every child. The growth pattern of a child with lowweight, length, and head circumference is commonly associated with familial short stature (see Chapter 173). Thesechildren are genetically normal but are smaller than most

A child who, by age, is preadolescent or adolescentand who starts puberty later than others may have the normal variant called constitutional short stature (see Chapter173); careful examination for abnormalities of pubertaldevelopment should be done, although most are normal. Anevaluation for primary amenorrhea should be consideredfor any female adolescent who has not reached menarche by15 years or has not done so within 3 years of thelarche. Lackof breast development by age 13 years also should be evaluated (see Chapter 174).

Breast budding under the areola (thelarche) and fine straight pubic hair over the mons pubis (adrenarche or pubarche)are early pubertal changes occurring around 11 years of age (range, 8 to 13 years) (see Chapter 174). These changes mark the sexual maturity rating, or Tanner stage, II of pubertal development (Figs. 67-3 and 67-4). Completion of the Tanner stages should take 4 to 5 years. The peak growth spurt usually

Note that in stage 1 (not shown) there is no pubic hair. (Courtesy of J.M. Tanner, MD, Institute of Child Health, Department of Growth and Development, University of London, London, England.) occurs approximately 1 year after thelarche at sexual maturity rating stage III to IV breast development and before the onset of menstruation (menarche). Menarche is a relatively late pubertal event. Females grow only 2 to 5 cm in height before menarche (see Chapter 174).

With regard to breast development (Fig. 29.3), Tanner stage 1 refers to the prepubertal state and includes no palpable breast tissue, with the areolae generally less than 2 cm in diameter. The nipples may be inverted, ﬂat, or raised. In Tanner stage 2, breast budding occurs, with a visible and palpable mound of breast tissue. The areolae begin to enlarge, the skin of the areolae thins, and the nipple develops to varying degrees. Tanner stage 3 is reﬂected by further growth and elevation of the entire breast. When the individual is seated and viewed from the side, the nipple is generally at or above the midplane of breast tissue. In most girls, Tanner stage 4 is defined by projection of the areola and papilla above the general breast contour in a secondary mound. Breast development is incomplete until Tanner stage 5, in which the breast is mature in contour and proportion. In most women, the nipple is more pigmented at this stage than earlier in

The nipple is generally below the midplane of breast tissue when the woman is seated and viewed from the side. Full breast development usually occurs over 3 to 3.5 years, but it may occur in as little as 2 years or not progress beyond stage 4 until the first pregnancy. Breast size is no indication of breast maturity.

delayed puberty in a parent or sibling is reassuring. Spontaneous puberty usually begins in these patients by the time the bone age reaches 12 years in boys and 11 years in girls. Other causes of delayed puberty must be eliminated before a diagnosis of constitutional delay in puberty is made. Observation and reassurance are appropriate. Adult height normal for the genetic potential is generally attained. In some cases, boys may be treated with low-dose testosterone for a few months if the bone age is at least 11 to 12 years. Treatment is not required for longer than 4 to

Patients with constitutional delay have delayed onset of pubertal development and significant bone age delay (2 standard deviations below the mean, which is equal to a 1.5to 2-year delay as a teenager). The height of the patient should remain close to the genetic potential, based on the parental heights, when reinterpreted for bone age (see Chapter 173). Usuallyheight gain is below, although fairly parallel to, the normal percentiles on the growth curve.

Estrogen treatment has been used in girls with constitutional delay, but there are no clear studies showing the added benefits. Young women with delayed puberty may need to be evaluated for primary amenorrhea.

A 66-year-old obese Caucasian man presented to an academic Diabetes Center for advice regarding his diabetes treatment. His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61–1.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily). How would you treat this patient?

The endocrine pancreas in the adult human consists of approximately 1 million islets of Langerhans interspersed throughout the pancreatic gland. Within the islets, at least five hormone-producing cells are present (Table 41–1). Their hormone products include insulin, the storage and anabolic hormone of the body; islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP, or amylin), which modulates appetite, gastric emptying, and glucagon and insulin secretion; glucagon, the hyperglycemic factor that mobilizes glycogen stores; somatostatin, a universal inhibitor of secretory cells; pancreatic peptide, a small protein that facilitates digestive processes by a mechanism not yet clarified; and ghrelin, a peptide known to increase pituitary growth hormone release.

Insulin is a small protein with a molecular weight in humans of 5808. It contains 51 amino acids arranged in two chains (A and

A 65-year-old man has a history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease with baseline creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL. Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2–3+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?

Abnormalities in fluid volume and electrolyte composition are common and important clinical disorders. Drugs that block specific transport functions of the renal tubules are valuable clinical tools in the treatment of these disorders. Although various agents that increase urine volume (diuretics) have been described since antiquity, it was not until 1937 that carbonic anhydrase inhibitors were first described and not until 1957 that a much more useful and powerful diuretic agent (chlorothiazide) became available.

A 32-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with weakness and hypokalemia. The patient had been very healthy until 2 months previously when he developed intermittent leg weakness. His review of systems was otherwise negative. He denied drug or laxative abuse and was on no medications. Past medical history was unremarkable, with no history of neuromuscular disease. Family history was notable for a sister with thyroid disease. Physical examination was notable only for reduced deep tendon reflexes.

This patient developed hypokalemia due to a redistribution of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular compartments; this pathophysiology was readily apparent following calculation of the TTKG. The TTKG is calculated as (P × U )/(P ×

U ). The expected values for the TTKG are <3 in the presence of hypokalemia and >7–8 in the presence of hyperkalemia (see also Case 2 and Case 8). Alternatively, a urinary K+-to-creatinine ratio of >13 mmol/g creatinine (>1.5 mmol/mmol creatinine) is compatible with excessive renal K+ excretion. In this case, the calculated TTKG was 2.5, consistent with appropriate renal conservation of K+ and a nonrenal cause for hypokalemia. In the absence of significant gastrointestinal loss of K+, the patient was diagnosed with a “redistributive” subtype of hypokalemia.

If the fasting plasma glucose level is less than 126 mg/dL (7 mMol/L) but diabetes is nonetheless suspected, then a standardized oral glucose tolerance test may be done (Table 41–4). The patient should eat nothing after midnight prior to the test day. On the morning of the test, adults are then given 75 g of glucose in 300 mL of water; children are given 1.75 g of glucose per kilogram of ideal body weight. The glucose load is consumed within 5 minutes. Blood samples for plasma glucose are obtained at 0 and 120 minutes after ingestion of glucose. An oral glucose tolerance test is normal if the fasting venous plasma glucose value is less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) and the 2-hour value falls below 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L). A fasting value of 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher or a 2-hour value of greater than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus. Patients with 2-hour value of 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.1 mmol/L) have impaired glucose tolerance.

B. Hemoglobin A1c Measurements

When plasma glucose levels are in the normal range, about 4–6% of hemoglobin A has one or both of the N terminal valines of their beta chains irreversibly glycated by glucose—referred to as hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). The HbA1c fraction is abnormally elevated in people with diabetes with chronic hyperglycemia. Since red cells have a lifespan of up to 120 days, the HbA1c value reflects plasma glucose levels over the preceding 8–12 weeks. In patients who monitor their glucose levels, the HbA1c value provides a valuable check on the accuracy of their monitoring. In patients who do not monitor their glucose levels, HbA1c measurements are essential for adjusting treatment. HbA1c can be used to diagnose diabetes. An HbA1c of 6.5% or greater if confirmed by repeat testing is diagnostic of diabetes. Less than 5.7% is normal, and patients with levels of 5.7–6.4% are considered at high risk for developing diabetes (Table 41–4).

A life-threatening autoimmune condition characterized by an intraepidermal blister leading to widespread painful erosions of the skin and mucous membranes. Antibodies are directed against desmoglein molecules responsible for keratinocyte adherence, leading to loss of cellular attachment. Patients are generally middle-aged (40–60).

Initial presentation is with mucous membrane involvement, typically mouth ulcers, with progression to skin involvement. Rarely, an intact blister may be seen, but generally presents only with erosions, often accompanied by crusting, weeping, and 2° infections.

Suspect HIV in a young person with severe seborrheic dermatitis.

A common disease that may be caused by Pityrosporum ovale, a generally harmless yeast found in sebum and hair follicles. It has a predilection for areas with oily skin such as the scalp, eyebrows, nasolabial folds, and midchest.

The appearance of rash varies with age:

Infants: Presents as a severe, red diaper rash with yellow scale, erosions, and blisters. A thick crust (“cradle cap”) may be seen on the scalp.

Children/adults: Red, scaly patches are seen around the ears, eyebrows, nasolabial fold, midchest, and scalp. The rash is more localized and less dramatic than that seen in infants.

Patients with HIV/AIDS can develop severe seborrheic dermatitis or an overlapping syndrome of severe seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and even Reiter’s syndrome.

Diagnosed by clinical impression. Rule out contact dermatitis and psoriasis.

Treatment consists of selenium sulfide or zinc pyrithione shampoos for the scalp, and topical antifungals and/or topical corticosteroids for other areas. Low-concentration coal tar shampoos are still available despite concerns about carcinogenicity.

As a rule, anorexia nervosa begins shortly after puberty—sometimes later, but seldom after 30 years of age. Some of the patients were overweight in childhood, especially in the prepubertal period. Dieting is much talked about and may have been encouraged, especially by mothers who want their daughters to be more attractive. In epochs such as the current one, where dieting and female thinness are considered normative and desirable, the illness seems to be more common and lesser but transient forms of the disorder are rampant in high school-and college-age young women. Sometimes there appears to be a precipitating event, such as leaving home, disruption of family life, or other stress. Whatever the provocation, it leads to an obsessive refusal to eat. What is more important, the abnormal eating habits persist even when the patient has become painfully thin, and when counseled to eat normally she will use every artifice to starve herself. Food is hidden instead of being eaten, vomiting may be provoked after a meal, or the bowel may be emptied by laxatives. The patient shows no concern about her obvious emaciation and remains active. If left alone, these patients waste away, and approximately 5 percent have succumbed to some intercurrent infection or other medical complication, placing it among the most lethal of psychiatric conditions.

One is struck with the degree of emaciation; it exceeds that of most of the known wasting diseases. Often 30 percent or more of the body weight will have been lost by the time the patient’s family insists on medical consultation. Bradycardia and hypotension are indicators for hospitalization. A fine lanugo covers the face, body, and limbs. The skin is thin and dry, without its normal elasticity, and the nails are brittle. The dental enamel is eroded. Pubic hair and breast tissue (except for loss of fat) are normal, and, in this respect, anorexia nervosa is unlike hypopituitary cachexia (Simmonds disease). Surprisingly, however, there are no neurologic signs of nutritional deficiency. The patient is alert and cheerfully indifferent to her condition. Any suggestion that she is unattractively thin or seriously depleted is rejected.

Orgasmic Dysfunction Lifelong orgasmic disorder is more common than acquired loss of orgasm. Some women acquire orgasmic dysfunction in association with relationship problems, depression, substance abuse, medication (especially use of SSRIs), or chronic illness (e.g., multiple sclerosis). Aside from those using SSRIs, most women who experience lack of orgasm are found on careful questioning to have only modest degrees of subjective excitement. Sometimes women respond to reassurance that most couples do not experience orgasm simultaneously, that most women experience orgasm far more easily from direct clitoral stimulation, and that this does not constitute dysfunction.

Common causes of lack of orgasm include obsessive self-observation and monitoring during the arousal phase, sometimes accompanied by anxiety and distracting negative and self-defeating thoughts. The woman may be so intent on monitoring her own and her partner’s response and concerned about “failing” that she is unable to allow her natural reﬂexes to take over and trigger an orgasm. Lack of orgasm may be related to negative feelings toward sexuality, low self-esteem, poor body image, a history of sexual abuse, and fear of losing control, and ineffective sexual technique. The only evidenced-based therapy is encouragement of self-stimulation, accompanied by erotic fantasy, so-called directed masturbation. Several excellent self-help books are available to help women become orgasmic through self-stimulation (105). A vibrator may be helpful if the plateau of high arousal is reached but there is still no orgasmic release. When the woman has experienced orgasm with self-stimulation with or without the use of a vibrator, she may or may not be able to teach the technique to her partner. Issues of trust may surface, and more intense psychological help may be needed. To counter the orgasmic delay or absence induced by SSRIs, highly selected women benefited from the prophylactic use of sildenafil (61).

Many studies of sexuality and aging show that older women report less distress about lack of desire when compared with younger women (17,18,43). In a nonclinical study of 102 women, the determinants of sexual satisfaction in those younger than 45 years of age were compared with those of women older than 45 years of age (18). There was no difference in sexual satisfaction achieved either by intercourse or noncoital sexual activities. Older women reported lower frequency of orgasm and different ratings on certain dimensions of sexual satisfaction. For the older women, the dominant qualities important to their satisfaction were those related to an emotional sense of calm and to factors such as feeling secure with their partner, whereas for younger women the subjective physical experience was more important.

Despite reports of reduced sexual interest and desire by some older women, most retain some interest and maintain the potential for sexual pleasure for their entire lives. In older women, a strong predictor of continued sexual interest is sexual behavior and enjoyment at an earlier age. A discrepancy between sexual interest and actual sexual activity occurs in many cases because an adequate partner is no longer available. In other instances, the cessation of sexual activity with age is more an expression of emotional problems resulting from lack of tenderness, communication, and attraction.

In addition to partner availability, an older woman’s sexuality is inﬂuenced by her partner’s general and sexual health and the relationship itself, which will determine how well the couple can adapt to changes in their sexual function as they age (17,44,45). Although some older women may retain negative societal attitudes toward sex that it is not “natural” (i.e., not focused intercourse), studies show a shift from intercourse to nonpenetrative sex and to a variety of activities that involve affection, romance, affectionate physical intimacy, and companionship (46). For some older women, it is clear that the setting, whether a nursing home or a grown-up child’s home, strongly inﬂuences the opportunity for sexual expression.

Approach to the Patient The severity of depression is determined by the patient’s emotional pain and the degree of interference with her normal functioning. Depression is an agonizingly painful and disabling, but readily diagnosable and treatable, disease (108). Nevertheless, it shares the stigma of all psychiatric disorders. Patients and their families often attribute the signs and symptoms of depression to life circumstances or to a medical condition, either diagnosed or undiagnosed. The persistence of symptoms in the face of a pleasant life situation or the failure of the patient to respond to attempts at cheering, such as changes of scene, often exacerbate suffering by provoking guilt in the patient and frustration in her significant others. Some patients report low energy and general malaise rather than depressed mood. Physical symptoms are especially common in Asian and some other cultures and in the elderly (107). Some patients with severe depression continue to function and can appear normal and cheerful. The only way to rule out depression is by asking about symptoms and using the diagnostic criteria (108).

Management Both antidepressant medication and psychotherapy are effective treatments for depression. There is evidence that a combination of the two produces the best outcomes (109–111). Reports about the efficacy of alternative treatments, the most common of which is St. John’s wort, are conﬂicting, but mostly negative (112). Patients should be specifically questioned about their use of herbal and other preparations and encouraged to use those whose components are standardized. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a promising research intervention (113,114).

There are many forms of psychotherapy. Those that were specifically studied for efficacy in the treatment of depression are cognitive-behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy. These forms of therapy are focused on present thoughts, feelings, relationships, and behaviors. Therapy continues for a set number of sessions, usually no more than 16 weekly sessions, in a prescribed, predetermined progression (115). There is increasing evidence that supportive and psychodynamic psychotherapy is effective.

Initially, the patient was noted to be behaving inappropriately including using foul language and grabbing people unexpectedly. This has progressed to a worsening of his memory and trouble caring for himself. His temperature is 98.1°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 162/103 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an elderly man who laughs inappropriately at times and who is a poor historian. When he is engaged in conversation, he exhibits word finding difficulty and is rather inattentive. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

In yet other instances, an early abnormality may be in the nature of emotional instability, taking the form of unreasonable outbursts of anger, easy tearfulness, or aggressiveness. A change in mood becomes apparent, deviating more toward depression than elation. Apathy is common. Some patients are irascible; a few are cheerful and facetious. The direction of the mood change is said to depend on the patient’s previous personality rather than on the character of the disease, but one can think of glaring exceptions to this statement from clinical experience. Excessive lability of affect may also be observed—for example, easy fluctuation from laughter to tears on slight provocation.

A considerable group of patients come to the physician with physical complaints, the most common being dizziness, a vague mental “fogginess,” and nondescript headaches. The patient’s inability to give a coherent account of his symptoms bears witness to the presence of dementia. Sleep disturbances, especially insomnia, are prominent in some cases and a particular disorder relating to the acting out of dreams during REM sleep marks some of the degenerative dementia. Sometimes the mental failure is brought to light more dramatically by a severe confusional state attending a febrile illness, a concussive head injury, an operative procedure, or the administration of some new medicine, as discussed in the following text and in Chap. 19. As noted there, the family almost uniformly, but mistakenly, dates an abrupt onset of dementia to the time of the intercurrent illness, a fall, or an operation.

4. In a chronic delusional-hallucinatory state in a chronic alcoholic patient (chronic alcoholic hallucinosis) it will usually be disclosed that the illness began when alcohol was withdrawn, after a period of sustained drinking, and at first took the form of an acute auditory hallucinosis characterized by threatening, exteriorized auditory hallucinations to which the patient’s emotional reaction was appropriate. Only later do a few of these patients drift into a quiet hallucinatory, mildly paranoid state, with rather bland affect. Evidence of the prepsychotic schizoid personality cannot be detected and there is usually no family history of schizophrenia. Cases of this type with which we are familiar had their onset between 45 and 50 years of age, that is, much later than the usual age of onset of schizophrenia.

5. A patient who is confused or stuporous and seemingly catatonic-negativistic, refusing or unable to speak, to execute commands, or to be activated in any way. If signs of focal cerebral or brainstem disease are absent, one is tempted to make a diagnosis of catatonic schizophrenia, not appreciating that catatonia as a phenomenon may be indistinguishable from akinetic mutism (see Chap. 15). It may also appear with widespread disease of the associational cortices and as mentioned earlier, with severe depression, certain confusional states, and hysteria. The authors have seen cases of hypoxic and other metabolic encephalopathies, Schilder disease, certain storage diseases, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease mistaken for schizophrenia because of failure to adhere to this principle.

6. A patient with temporal lobe epilepsy who, apart from intermittent psychomotor seizures, has long periods (weeks or months) of hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior, and disorganization of thinking. Such a mental disturbance reflects the presence of a persistent state of temporal lobe seizures (temporal lobe status epilepticus), which in some cases has been demonstrated by depth electrodes to originate in the amygdaloid or other medial temporal areas. The nature of the disturbances of emotionality and mentation in such patients, a somewhat controversial subject, is discussed in Chaps. 15 and 24.

Central sleep apnea (CSA): A condition in which both airf ow and respiratory effort cease. CSA is linked to morning headaches, mood changes, and repeated awakenings during the night.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): A condition in which airf ow ceases as a result of obstruction along the respiratory passages. OSA is strongly associated with snoring. Risk factors include male gender, obesity, prior upper airway surgeries, a deviated nasal septum, a large uvula or tongue, and retrognathia (recession of the mandible).

In both forms, arousal results in cessation of the apneic event.

Associated with sudden death in infants and elderly, headaches, depression, ↑ systolic blood pressure, and pulmonary hypertension.

Dx: Sleep studies (polysomnography) document the number of arousals, obstructions, and episodes of ↓ O2 saturation; distinguish OSA from CSA; and identify possible movement disorders, seizures, or other sleep disorders.

Tx:

OSA: Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Weight loss if obese. In children, most cases are due to tonsillar/adenoidal hypertrophy, which is corrected surgically.

CSA: Mechanical ventilation (e.g., BPAP) with a backup rate for severe cases.

A spectrum of disorders characterized by a misalignment between desired and actual sleep periods. Subtypes include jet-lag type, shift-work type, delayed sleep-phase type, and unspecif ed.

Tx:

Jet-lag type usually resolves within 2–7 days without specific treatment.

Shift-work type may respond to light therapy.

Oral melatonin may be useful if given 5½ hours prior to the desired bedtime.

Patients often present with medically unexplained somatic symptoms, generally with varying etiologies.

Somatoform disorders: Patients have no conscious control over symptoms. The fve main categories are outlined in Table 2.14-14.

one of several mechanisms discussed further on is believed to cause the progression of symptoms. As with acute subdural hematoma, the disturbances of mentation and consciousness (drowsiness, inattentiveness, and confusion) are more prominent than focal or lateralizing signs, and they may fluctuate. Focal signs, when present, consist of mild hemiparesis and, rarely, an aphasic disturbance. Homonymous hemianopia is seldom observed, probably because the geniculocalcarine pathway is deep and not easily compressed; similarly, hemiplegia, that is, complete paralysis of one arm and leg, is usually indicative of a lesion within the cerebral hemisphere

In chronic subdural hematoma, the traumatic etiology is often less clear. The head injury, especially in elderly persons and in those taking anticoagulant drugs, may have been trivial and forgotten. A period of weeks then follows when headaches (not invariable), light-headedness, slowness in thinking, apathy and drowsiness, unsteady gait, and occasionally a seizure are the main symptoms. The initial impression may be that the patient has a vascular lesion or brain tumor or is suffering from drug intoxication, a depressive illness, or Alzheimer disease.

Children with fever without a focus present a diagnostic challenge that includes identifying bacteremia and sepsis. Bacteremia, the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream, may be primary or secondary to a focal infection. Sepsis is the systemic response to infection that is manifested by hyperthermia or hypothermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, and shock (see Chapter 40). Children with septicemia and signs of central nervous system dysfunction (irritability, lethargy), cardiovascular impairment (cyanosis, poor perfusion), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (petechiae, ecchymosis) are readily recognized as toxic appearing or septic. Most febrile illnesses in children may be categorized as follows:

Fever of short duration accompanied by localizing signs and symptoms, in which a diagnosis can often be established by clinical history and physical examination

Fever without localizing signs (fever without a focus), frequently occurring in children younger than 3 years of age, in which a history and physical examination fail to establish a cause

Fever of unknown origin (FUO), defined as fever for >14 days without an identified etiology despite history, physical examination, and routine laboratory tests or after 1 week of hospitalization and evaluation

Fever or temperature instability in infants younger than3 months of age is associated with a higher risk of serious bacterial infections than in older infants. These youngerinfants usually exhibit only fever and poor feeding, without localizing signs of infection. Most febrile illnesses inthis age group are caused by common viral pathogens, butserious bacterial infections include bacteremia (caused by group B streptococcus [GBS], Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes in neonates; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, nontyphoidal Salmonella, and Neisseria meningitidis in 1to 3-month-old infants), urinary tract infection (UTI) (E. coli), pneumonia (S. pneumoniae, GBS, or Staphylococcus aureus), meningitis (S. pneumoniae,

Clinically, chickenpox presents as a rash, low-grade fever, and malaise, although a few patients develop a prodrome 1–2 days before onset of the exanthem. In the immunocompetent patient, chickenpox is usually a benign illness associated with lassitude and with body temperatures of 37.8°–39.4°C (100°–103°F) of 3–5 days’ duration. The skin lesions—the hallmark of the infection—include maculopapules, vesicles, and scabs in various stages of evolution (Fig. 217-1). These lesions, which evolve from maculopapules to vesicles over hours to days, appear on the trunk and face and rapidly spread to involve other areas of the body. Most are small and have an erythematous base with a diameter of 5–10 mm. Successive crops appear over a 2to 4-day period. Lesions can also be found on the mucosa of the pharynx and/or the vagina. Their severity varies from one person to another. Some individuals have very few lesions, while others have as many as 2000. Younger children tend to have fewer vesicles than older individuals. Secondary and tertiary cases within families are associated with a relatively large number of vesicles. Immunocompromised patients— both children and adults, particularly those with leukemia—have lesions (often with a hemorrhagic base) that are more numerous and take longer to heal than those of immunocompetent patients. Immunocompromised individuals are also at greater risk for visceral complications, which occur in 30–50% of cases and are fatal 15% of the time in the absence of antiviral therapy.

The most common infectious complication of varicella is secondary bacterial superinfection of the skin, which is usually caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus, including strains that are methicillin-resistant. Skin infection results from excoriation of lesions after scratching. Gram’s staining of skin lesions should help clarify the etiology of unusually erythematous and pustulated lesions.

stapHylococcal scalded-sKin syndrome SSSS primarily affects newborns and children. The illness may vary from a localized blister to exfoliation of much of the skin surface. The skin is usually fragile and often tender, with thin-walled, fluid-filled bullae. Gentle pressure results in rupture of the lesions, leaving denuded underlying skin (Nikolsky’s sign; Fig. 172-4). The mucous membranes are usually spared. In more generalized infection, there are often constitutional symptoms, including fever, lethargy, and irritability with poor feeding. Significant amounts of fluid can be lost in more extensive cases. Illness usually follows localized infection at one of a number of possible sites. SSSS is much less common among adults but can follow infections caused by exfoliative toxin–producing strains.

Primary prevention of S. aureus infections in the hospital setting involves hand washing and careful attention to appropriate isolation procedures. Through careful screening for MRSA carriage and strict isolation practices, several Scandinavian countries have been remarkably

All rights reserved.) successful at preventing the introduction and dissemination of MRSA in hospitals.

Decolonization strategies, using both universal and targeted approaches with topical agents (e.g., mupirocin) to eliminate nasal colonization and/or chlorhexidine to eliminate cutaneous colonization with S. aureus, have been successful in some clinical settings (e.g., intensive care units) where the risk of infection is high. An analysis of clinical trials suggests that there may also be a reduction in the incidence of postsurgical infections among persons who are nasally colonized with S. aureus.

features, are almost always due to β-hemolytic streptococci, usually GAS and occasionally group C or G. Often, however, the appearance of streptococcal cellulitis is not sufficiently distinctive to permit a specific diagnosis on clinical grounds. The area involved may not be typical for erysipelas, the lesion may be less intensely red than usual and may fade into surrounding skin, and/or the patient may appear only mildly ill. In such cases, it is prudent to broaden the spectrum of empirical antimicrobial therapy to include other pathogens, particularly S. aureus, that can produce cellulitis with the

cellulitis Inoculation of organisms into the skin may lead to cellulitis: infection involving the skin and subcutaneous tissues. The portal of entry may be a traumatic or surgical wound, an insect bite, or any other break in skin integrity. Often, no entry site is apparent. One form of streptococcal cellulitis, erysipelas, is characterized by a bright red appearance of the involved skin, which forms a plateau sharply demarcated from surrounding normal skin (Fig. 173-4). The lesion is warm to the touch, may be tender, and appears shiny and swollen. The skin often has a

skin often has a peau d’orange texture, which is thought to reflect involvement of superficial lymphatics; superficial blebs or bullae may form, usually 2–3 days after onset. The lesion typically develops over a few hours and is associated with fever and chills. Erysipelas tends to occur on the malar area of the face (often with extension over the bridge of the nose to the contralateral malar region) and the lower extremities. After one episode, recurrence at the same site—sometimes years later— is not uncommon. Classic cases of erysipelas, with typical features, are almost always

A 32-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with weakness and hypokalemia. The patient had been very healthy until 2 months previously when he developed intermittent leg weakness. His review of systems was otherwise negative. He denied drug or laxative abuse and was on no medications. Past medical history was unremarkable, with no history of neuromuscular disease. Family history was notable for a sister with thyroid disease. Physical examination was notable only for reduced deep tendon reflexes.

This patient developed hypokalemia due to a redistribution of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular compartments; this pathophysiology was readily apparent following calculation of the TTKG. The TTKG is calculated as (P × U )/(P ×

U ). The expected values for the TTKG are <3 in the presence of hypokalemia and >7–8 in the presence of hyperkalemia (see also Case 2 and Case 8). Alternatively, a urinary K+-to-creatinine ratio of >13 mmol/g creatinine (>1.5 mmol/mmol creatinine) is compatible with excessive renal K+ excretion. In this case, the calculated TTKG was 2.5, consistent with appropriate renal conservation of K+ and a nonrenal cause for hypokalemia. In the absence of significant gastrointestinal loss of K+, the patient was diagnosed with a “redistributive” subtype of hypokalemia.

Hemodialysis is the most effective and reliable method to reduce plasma K+ concentration; peritoneal dialysis is considerably less effective. Patients with acute kidney injury require temporary, urgent venous access for hemodialysis, with the attendant risks; in contrast, patients with ESRD or advanced chronic kidney disease may have a preexisting venous access. The amount of K+ removed during hemodialysis depends on the relative distribution of K+ between ICF and ECF (potentially affected by prior therapy for hyperkalemia), the type and surface area of the dialyzer used, dialysate and blood flow rates, dialysate flow rate, dialysis duration, and the plasma-to-dialysate K+ gradient.

A 23-year-old woman was admitted with a 3-day history of fever, cough productive of blood-tinged sputum, confusion, and orthostasis. Past medical history included type 1 diabetes mellitus. A physical examination in the emergency department indicated postural hypo-tension, tachycardia, and Kussmaul respiration.

The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly.

The plasma Na+ concentration on admission was 113 meq/L, with a creatinine of 2.35 (Table 64e-1). At hospital hour 7, the plasma Na+ concentration was 120 meq/L, potassium 5.4 meq/L, chloride 90 64e-5 meq/L, bicarbonate 22 meq/L, BUN 32 mg/dL, creatinine 2.02 mg/dL, glucose 89 mg/dL, total protein 5.0, and albumin 1.9.

After the plasma Na+ concentration dropped to 116 meq/L, intravenous fluid was switched to normal saline at the same infusion rate. The subsequent results are shown in Table 64e-1.

She had experienced diarrhea for some time and manifested an orthostatic tachycardia after a liter of normal saline. As expected for hypovolemic hyponatremia, the urine Na+ concentration was <20 meq/L in the absence of congestive heart failure or other causes of hypervolemic hyponatremia, and she responded to saline hydration with an increase in plasma Na+ concentration and a decrease in creatinine.

Ultrasound Monitoring Ovulation is characterized both by a decrease in the size of a monitored ovarian follicle and by the appearance of ﬂuid in the cul-de-sac using transvaginal ultrasound (124). Follicles reach a preovulatory diameter of 17 to 19 mm in spontaneous cycles or 19 to 25 mm for clomiphene-induced cycles (136,137). A combination of LH testing and ultrasound can be used, with LH kit testing starting when the ultrasound-measured follicle size reaches 14 mm (131). Ten percent of the cycles of normally fertile women may have a luteinized unruptured follicle, whereby progesterone is released and the luteal phase progresses normally without visible signs of follicle rupture when daily ultrasounds are performed from cycle days 10 to 20. This incidence is increased to 25% in women with unexplained infertility (138). Because of the inconvenience and expense of serial measurements, ultrasound monitoring should be reserved for patients who fail less expensive methods for detecting ovulation or for certain types of ovulation induction (124).

Follow-Up Tests In women with absent or infrequent ovulation, serum FSH, prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) testing should be performed (124).

The most common cause of oligo-ovulation and anovulation—both in the general population and among women presenting with infertility—is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) (139). The diagnosis of PCOS is determined by exclusion of other medical conditions such as pregnancy, hypothalamic–pituitary disorders, or other causes of hyperandrogenism (e.g., androgen-secreting tumors or nonclassical congenital adrenal hyperplasia) and the presence of two of the following conditions (140):

Oligo-ovulation or anovulation (manifested as oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea)

Hyperandrogenemia (elevated levels of circulating androgens) or hyperandrogenism (clinical manifestations of androgen excess)

Masses that include the fallopian tube are related primarily to inﬂammatory causes in the reproductive age group. A tubo-ovarian abscess can be present in association with PID (see Chapter 18). In addition, a complex inﬂammatory mass consisting of bowel, tube, and ovary may be present without a large abscess cavity. Ectopic pregnancies can occur in the reproductive age group and must be excluded when a patient presents with pain, a positive pregnancy test, and an adnexal mass (see Chapter 20). Paraovarian cysts may be noted either on examination or on imaging studies. In many instances, a normal ipsilateral ovary can be visualized using ultrasonography. The frequency of malignancy in paraovarian tumors is quite low and may be more common in paraovarian masses larger than 5 cm (218).

Diagnosis A complete pelvic examination, including rectovaginal examination and Papanicolaou (Pap) test, should be performed. Estimations of the size of a mass should be presented in centimeters rather than in comparison to common objects or fruit (e.g., orange, grapefruit, tennis ball, golf ball). After pregnancy is excluded, one simple office technique that can help determine whether a mass is uterine or adnexal includes sounding and measuring the depth of the uterine cavity. Pelvic imaging can confirm the characteristics of the adnexal mass—whether solid or cystic or mixed echogenicity. Diagnosis of uterine leiomyomas usually is based on the characteristic finding of an irregularly enlarged uterus. The size and location of the usually multiple leiomyomas can be confirmed and documented with pelvic ultrasonography (Fig. 14.23). If the examination is adequate to confirm uterine leiomyoma and symptoms are absent, ultrasonography is not always necessary unless an ovarian mass cannot be excluded.

Other Studies Endometrial sampling with an endometrial biopsy or hysteroscopy is mandatory when both pelvic mass and abnormal bleeding are present. An endometrial lesion—carcinoma or hyperplasia—may coexist with a benign mass such as a leiomyoma. In

A baseline plasma total testosterone level >12 nmol/L (>3.5 ng/mL) usually indicates a virilizing tumor, whereas a level >7 nmol/L (>2 ng/ mL) is suggestive. A basal DHEAS level >18.5 μmol/L (>7000 μg/L) suggests an adrenal tumor. Although DHEAS has been proposed as a “marker” of predominant adrenal androgen excess, it is not unusual to find modest elevations in DHEAS among women with PCOS. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be used to localize an adrenal mass, and transvaginal ultrasound usually suffices to identify an ovarian mass if clinical evaluation and hormonal levels suggest these possibilities.

PCOS is the most common cause of ovarian androgen excess (Chap. 412). An increased ratio of LH to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is characteristic in carefully studied patients with PCOS. However, because of the pulsatile nature of gonadotropin secretion, this finding may be absent in up to half of women with PCOS. Therefore, measurement of plasma LH and FSH is not needed to make a diagnosis of PCOS. Transvaginal ultrasound classically shows enlarged ovaries and increased stroma in women with PCOS. However, cystic ovaries also may be found in women without clinical or laboratory features of PCOS.

It has been suggested that the measurement of circulating levels of antimüllerian hormone (AMH) may help in making the diagnosis of PCOS; however, this remains controversial. AMH levels reflect ovarian reserve and correlate with follicular number. Measurement of AMH can be useful when considering premature ovarian insufficiency in a patient who presents with oligomenorrhea, in which case a subnormal level of AMH will be present.

The most common cause of heterosexual development at the expected age of puberty is PCOS (Fig. 29.21). Because the syndrome is heterogeneous and poorly defined, clinical difficulties result in diagnosis and management (90). For the sake of simplicity, PCOS may be defined as LH-dependent hyperandrogenism (91). The Rotterdam criteria are commonly used to identify individuals with PCOS and require the presence of at least two of the following: oligoor anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries, with exclusion of other etiologies (CAH, androgen-secreting tumors, Cushing syndrome) (92). Polycystic ovaries ultrasonically are defined as the presence of 12 or more follicles in each ovary measuring 2 to 9 mm in diameter and/or increased ovarian volume (>10 mL). Most clinical manifestations arise as a consequence of the hyperandrogenism and often include hirsutism beginning at or near puberty and irregular menses from the age of menarche because of oligoovulation or anovulation. Clinical manifestations are as follows: 1.

Affected girls may be but are not necessarily somewhat overweight.

2.

In rare instances, menarche may be delayed, and primary amenorrhea may occur.

3.

Basal levels of LH tend to be elevated in most affected individuals, and androgen production is invariably increased, even though circulating levels of androgens may be near the upper limits of the normal range in many affected women.

The syndrome is characterized by episodes of acute meningitis with severe headache and sometimes low-grade fever, lasting for about 2 weeks, and recurring over a period of several months or years.

As discussed earlier, both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can cause genital or oral infection, and both produce indistinguishable primary or recurrent mucocutaneous lesions. Primary infection with HSV-2 often may be asymptomatic or may produce a variety of signs and symptoms. Locally painful vesicular lesions may be accompanied by dysuria, urethral discharge, local lymph node enlargement and tenderness, http://ebooksmedicine.net and systemic manifestations, such as fever, muscle aches, and headache. HSV is actively shed during this period, and shedding continues until the mucosal lesions have completely healed. However, asymptomatic viral shedding can occur as long as 3 months after diagnosis. Signs and symptoms may last for several weeks during the primary phase of disease. Recurrences are milder and of shorter duration than in the primary episode. Diagnosis is most often made by viral culture or nucleic acid amplification testing of fluid collected after “unroofing” of a vesicular lesion.

In immunocompetent adults, herpes genitalis generally is not life-threatening. However, HSV poses a major threat to immunosuppressed patients, in whom fatal, disseminated disease may develop. Also life-threatening is neonatal herpes infection, which occurs in about one-half of infants delivered vaginally of mothers suffering from either primary or recurrent genital HSV infection. The viral infection is acquired during passage through the birth canal. Its incidence has risen in parallel with the rise in genital HSV infection. The manifestations of neonatal herpes vary from involvement of superficial sites (skin, eyes and mouth) to involvement of the CNS, with or without disseminated infection of other organs such as the liver and lungs. Approximately 60% of affected infants die of the disease, with significant morbidity occurring in about one-half of the survivors. PCR-based testing is far more sensitive and the preferred method for diagnosis of encephalitis.

Hx/PE:

Patients typically have multiple somatic complaints, frequent ER visits, and unexplained injuries with delayed medical treatment. They may also avoid eye contact or act afraid or hostile.

Children may exhibit precocious sexual behavior, genital or anal trauma, STDs, UTIs, and psychiatric problems.

Other clues include a partner who answers questions for the patient or refuses to leave the exam room.

Tx: Perform a screening assessment of the patient’s safety domestically and in their close personal relationships. Provide medical care, emotional support, and counseling; educate the patient about support services and refer appropriately. Documentation is crucial.

Accounts for 30,000 deaths per year in the United States; the eighth overall cause of death in the United States. One suicide occurs every 20 minutes.

Risk factors include male gender, age greater than 45 years, psychiatric disorders (major depression, presence of psychotic symptoms), a history of an admission to a psychiatric institution, a previous suicide attempt, a history of violent behavior, ethanol or substance abuse, recent severe stressors, and a family suicide history (see the mnemonic SAD PERSONS).

Women are more likely to attempt suicide, whereas men are more likely to succeed by virtue of their ↑ use of more lethal methods.

Dx:

Perform a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation.

Ask about family history, previous attempts, ambivalence toward death, and hopelessness.

Ask directly about suicidal ideation, intent, and plan, and look for available means.

Tx: A patient who endorses suicidality requires emergent inpatient hospitalization even against his will. Suicide risk may ↑ after antidepressant therapy is initiated because a patient’s energy to act on suicidal thoughts can return before the depressed mood lifts.

Atypical Agents Medications considered atypical include venlafaxine, lithium salts, and anticonvulsants, which are effective mood stabilizers used for bipolar disorders (126–130). Bupropion is available in a once-a-day preparation. It lowers the seizure threshold slightly more than other antidepressants and should be avoided or used with caution in patients who have a history of head trauma. It is used, under a separate trade name, for smoking cessation, and is particularly useful for smokers who are depressed. Bupropion seems to cause fewer sexual side effects than the SSRIs and may decrease these side effects when added to an SSRI regimen.

Suicide The most acute issue in the assessment and referral of depressed patients is the possibility of suicide (131). Following are the risk factors for suicide:

Previous suicide attempts, even if seemingly not serious

Family history of suicide  A plan to commit suicide

Access to the means to carry out the plan

Women attempt suicide more frequently than men, but men complete the act more frequently than women (131,132). This is probably because men use more drastic or irreversible means, such as firearms, whereas women tend to overdose, which can be treated if discovered. It might seem that someone who repeatedly makes suicidal gestures is more interested in the responses of others than in ending her life. However, past attempts or gestures increase the risk of completed suicide. Patients who made a suicide attempt should be queried about the following risk factors: the intent to die (rather than escape, sleep, or make people understand her distress); increasing numbers or doses of drugs taken in a progression of attempts; and drug or alcohol misuse, especially if it, too, is increasing. Inquiry about suicidal ideation and behavior is an inherent part of every mental status examination and is mandatory for every patient with past or current depression or evidence of self-destructive behavior. The inquiry can follow from discussion of difficulties in the patient’s life or mood or be introduced with a comment that almost everyone has thoughts of death at one time or another. Nonsuicidal patients will immediately volunteer that they have had such thoughts and that they have no intention of acting on them. They will often add reasons: they have too much to look forward to, it is against their religion, or it would hurt their family.

Symptoms tend to be more affect-laden among females, and there are more psychotic symptoms, as well as a greater propensity for psychotic symptoms to worsen in later life.

Other symptom differences include less frequent negative symptoms and disorganization.

Finally, social functioning tends to remain better preserved in females. There are, how- ever, frequent exceptions to these general caveats.

Approximately 5%—6% of individuals with schizophrenia die by suicide, about 20% attempt suicide on one or more occasions, and many more have significant suicidal ideation. Suicidal behavior is sometimes in response to command hallucinations to harm oneself or others.

Suicide risk remains high over the whole lifespan for males and females, although it may be especially high for younger males with comorbid substance use. Other risk factors include having depressive symptoms or feelings of hopelessness and being unemployed, and the risk is higher, also, in the period after a psychotic episode or hospital discharge.

Functional Consequences of Schizophrenia

Schizophrenia is associated with significant social and occupational dysfunction. Making educational progress and maintaining employment are frequently impaired by avolition or other disorder manifestations, even when the cognitive skills are sufficient for the tasks at hand. Most individuals are employed at a lower level than their parents, and most, par- ticularly men, do not marry or have limited social contacts outside of their family.

Major depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic or catatonic features. The distinc- tion between schizophrenia and major depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features or with catatonia depends on the temporal relationship between the mood distur- bance and the psychosis, and on the severity of the depressive or manic symptoms. If de- lusions or hallucinations occur exclusively during a major depressive or manic episode, the diagnosis is depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features.

Schizoaffective disorder. A diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that a major depressive or manic episode occur concurrently with the active-phase symptoms and that the mood symptoms be present for a majority of the total duration of the active periods.

Some 30,000 suicides are recorded annually in the United States, and attempted suicides exceed this number by approximately 10 times. All psychiatrists agree that these are conservative figures. Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death among adults in the United States and the second leading cause among persons between the ages of 15 and 24 years, figures that emphasize the importance of recognizing depression that has a high potential for self-destruction. Every physician should be familiar with the few clues we possess to identify those patients who intend to end their lives. Some of the questions that may be broached in the interview regarding depression were listed earlier, but particularly, “Do you think of hurting yourself or taking your own life?” and the follow-through query, “Do you have a plan?” Physicians should also be aware that the majority of suicides are accomplished by taking an overdose of prescribed medications, for which reason caution needs to be exercised in their distribution and administration in depressed patients.

Some views, summarized by Mann (1998), are that suicidal intent represents a special form of depression, or an important variant of it, and that certain individuals are by nature susceptible as a result of biologic factors. In other words, suicide is not simply a cognitive response to extreme stress or despondency. Certainly impulsivity, a frontal lobe phenomenon, seems to be an element of the suicidal act in many cases but this also is difficult to anticipate and prevent. There is no way for the authors to judge these views, but proponents have pointed to particular indices of serotonin function that differ between depressed individuals who attempt suicide and those who do not. It has also been observed that the inception of modern antidepressant medications has not greatly altered the rate of suicide among depressed patients. Bipolar illness, endogenous depression, depression resulting from a debilitating disease (particularly Huntington disease, cancer, and HIV), pathologic grief, and depression in an alcoholic or schizophrenic, all carry the risk of suicide. In bipolar disease and endogenous depression, the risk of suicide over the lifetime of the patient is approximately 15 percent (Guze and Robins). In Robins’ series of 134 patients who committed suicide, 47 percent had a known depressive illness and 25 percent were alcoholic. Other series have recorded even higher rates of depression, alcoholism, and drug abuse (see Andreasen and Black).

The rash consists of clusters of tense clear vesicles on an erythematous base, which become cloudy after a few days (as a result of accumulation of inflammatory cells), and dry, crusted, and scaly after 5 to 10 days. In a small number of patients, the vesicles are confluent and hemorrhagic, and healing is delayed for several weeks. In most cases, pain and dysesthesia last for 1 to 4 weeks; but in the others (7 to 33 percent in different series) the pain persists for months or, in different forms, for years, and presents a difficult problem in management. Impairment of superficial sensation in the affected dermatome(s) is common, and segmental weakness and atrophy are added in approximately 5 percent of patients. In the majority of patients, the rash and sensorimotor signs are limited to the territory of a single dermatome, but in some, particularly those with cranial or limb involvement, two or more contiguous dermatomes are involved.

Rarely (and usually in association with malignancy) the rash is generalized, like that of chickenpox, or it is altogether absent (zoster sine herpete) in which case, the pain is often attributed to another more mundane process such as sciatica.

In more than half of the cases, the CSF shows a mild increase in cells, mainly lymphocytes, and a modest increase in protein content (although lumbar puncture is not performed to establish the diagnosis). The herpetic nature of the eruption can be confirmed by direct immunofluorescence of a biopsied skin lesion, using antibody to VZV, or inferred by finding multinucleated giant cells in scrapings from the base of an early vesicle (Tzanck smear). The spinal fluid also contains antibodies to the virus or evidence of the organism by PCR testing in 35 percent of cases according to a prospective study by Haanpää and colleagues.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Early Infection: Stage 1 (Localized Infection) Because of the small size of nymphal ixodid ticks, most patients do not remember the preceding tick bite. After an incubation period of 3–32 days, EM usually begins as a red macule or papule at the site of the tick bite that expands slowly to form a large annular lesion (Fig. 210-1). As the lesion increases in size, it often develops a bright red outer border and partial central clearing. The center of the lesion sometimes becomes intensely erythematous and indurated, vesicular, or necrotic. In other instances, the expanding lesion remains an even, intense red; several red rings are found within an outside ring; or the central area turns blue before the lesion clears. Although EM can be located anywhere, the thigh, groin, and axilla are particularly common sites. The lesion is warm but not often painful. Approximately 20% of patients do not exhibit this characteristic skin manifestation.

FIGuRE 210-1 A classic erythema migrans lesion (9 cm in diameter) is shown near the right axilla. The lesion has partial central clearing, a bright red outer border, and a target center. (Courtesy of Vijay K. Sikand, MD; with permission.)

Early Infection: Stage 2 (Disseminated Infection) In cases in the United States, B. burgdorferi often spreads hematogenously to many sites within days or weeks after the onset of EM. In these cases, patients may develop secondary annular skin lesions similar in appearance to the initial lesion. Skin involvement is commonly accompanied by severe headache, mild stiffness of the neck, fever, chills, migratory musculoskeletal pain, arthralgias, and profound malaise and fatigue. Less common manifestations include generalized lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, hepatitis, sore throat, nonproductive cough, conjunctivitis, iritis, or testicular swelling. Except for fatigue and lethargy, which are often constant, the early signs and symptoms of Lyme disease are typically intermittent and changing. Even in untreated patients, the early symptoms usually become less severe or disappear within several weeks. In ~15% of patients, the infection presents with these nonspecific systemic symptoms.

The incubation period of varicella is generally 14 to 16 days, witha range of 10 to 21 days after exposure. Prodromal symptomsof fever, malaise, and anorexia may precede the rash by 1 day.The characteristic rash appears initially as small red papules thatrapidly progress to nonumbilicated, oval, “teardrop” vesicles onan erythematous base. The fluid progresses from clear to cloudy,and the vesicles ulcerate, crust, and heal. New crops appear for 3to 4 days, usually beginning on the trunk followed by the head,the face, and, less commonly, the extremities. There may be atotal of 100 to 500 lesions, with all forms of lesions being presentat the same time. Pruritus is universal and marked. Lesions maybe present on mucous membranes.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Pharyngitis Although seen in patients of all ages, GAS pharyngitis is one of the most common bacterial infections of childhood, accounting for 20–40% of all cases of exudative pharyngitis in children; it is rare among those under the age of 3. Younger children may manifest streptococcal infection with a syndrome of fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy without exudative pharyngitis. Infection is acquired through contact with another individual carrying the organism. Respiratory droplets are the usual mechanism of spread, although other routes, including food-borne outbreaks, have been well described. The incubation period is

The incubation period is 1–4 days. Symptoms include sore throat, fever and chills, malaise, and sometimes abdominal complaints and vomiting, particularly in children. Both symptoms and signs are quite variable, ranging from mild throat discomfort with minimal physical findings to high fever and severe sore throat associated with intense erythema and swelling of the pharyngeal mucosa and the presence of purulent exudate over the posterior pharyngeal wall and tonsillar pillars. Enlarged, tender anterior cervical lymph nodes commonly accompany exudative pharyngitis.

Non-neurologic etiologies include hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, hyperosmolar states, hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, porphyria, drug overdose (cocaine, antidepressants, neuroleptics, methylxanthines, lidocaine), drug withdrawal (alcohol and other sedatives), eclampsia, hyperthermia, hypertensive encephalopathy, head trauma, and cerebral hypoperfusion.

Seizures with a focal onset (or focal postictal deficit) suggest focal CNS pathology. They may be the presenting sign of a tumor, stroke, AVM, infection, hemorrhage, or developmental abnormality.

First seizures that resolve after a single episode are frequently left untreated when the underlying cause is unknown.

Arise from a discrete region, or an “epileptogenic focus,” in one cerebral hemisphere and do not lead to loss of consciousness unless they secondarily generalize.

Simple partial seizures: May include motor features (e.g., jacksonian march, or the progressive jerking of successive body regions) as well as sensory, autonomic, or psychic features (e.g., fear, déjà vu, hallucinations) without alteration of consciousness. A postictal focal neurologic deficit (e.g., hemiplegia/hemiparesis, or Todd’s paralysis) is possible and usually resolves within 24 hours. Often confused with acute stroke (ruled out by MRI).

Complex partial seizures: Typically involve the temporal lobe (70–80%) with bilateral spread of the aberrant electrical discharge. Characterized by an impaired level of consciousness, auditory or visual hallucinations, déjà vu, automatisms (e.g., lip smacking, chewing, or even walking), and postictal confusion/disorientation and amnesia.

Obtain an EEG.

Rule out systemic causes with a CBC, electrolytes, calcium, fasting glucose, LFTs, a renal panel, RPR, ESR, and a toxicology screen.

The symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia result from direct depression of the central nervous system owing to lack of energy substrate and the counterregulatory adrenergic response to low glucose via catecholamine secretion designed to correct hypoglycemia (see Table 172-2). Compared with older children, infants do not usually show adrenergic symptoms. The signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia in infants are relatively nonspecific and include jitteriness, feeding difficulties, pallor, hypotonia, hypothermia, episodes of apnea and bradycardia, depressed levels of consciousness, and seizures. In older children, signs and symptoms include confusion, irritability, headaches, visual changes, tremors, pallor, sweating, tachycardia, weakness, seizures, and coma.

Failure to recognize and treat severe, prolonged hypoglycemia can result in serious long-term morbidity, including mental retardation and nonhypoglycemic seizures. Younger infants and patients with more severe or prolonged hypoglycemia are at greatest risk for adverse outcomes.

Normal regulation of serum glucose concentrations requires appropriate interaction of a number of hormonal signals and metabolic pathways (Figure 172-1). In a normal individual, a decrease in serum glucose concentrations leads to a suppression of insulin secretion and increased secretion of the counterregulatory hormones (growth hormone [GH], cortisol, glucagon, and epinephrine) (see Fig. 172-1). This hormonal signal promotes the release of amino acids (particularly alanine) from muscle to fuel gluconeogenesis and the release of triglyceride from adipose tissue stores to provide free fatty acids (FFAs) for hepatic ketogenesis. FFAs and ketones serve as alternate fuels for muscle. This hormonal signal also stimulates the breakdown of hepatic glycogen and promotes gluconeogenesis. Failure of any of the components of this hormonal signal can lead to hypoglycemia.

Metabolic derangements are common causes of altered mental status. Disturbances of blood chemistries (glucose, sodium, calcium, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, ammonia) may produce depressed mental status. Metabolic causes of acute coma are suggested by spontaneous fluctuations in the level of consciousness, tremors, myoclonus, asterixis, visual and tactile hallucinations, and deep coma with preservation of pupillary light reflexes. Acute metabolic or toxic disorders usually produce a hypotonic, limp state, but hypertonia, rigidity, and decorticate and decerebrate posturing are sometimes observed in coma caused by hypoglycemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and short-acting barbiturates. A subacute course of somnolence progressing to difficulty arousing from a deep sleep (stupor) over hours suggests drug intoxication or organ system failure (kidney, liver) producing a metabolic encephalopathy. Care must be taken to investigate background medical conditions that may produce a decline in consciousness (e.g., diabetes mellitus, leukemia, kidney failure, liver disease). Intoxication and ingestion are common causes of acute alteration of consciousness, and a thorough history must be taken to search for the offending agent (Chapter 45). A history of social and emotional difficulties, drug abuse, or depression raises concern for self-inflicted injury or toxic ingestion.

Central nervous system infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis, usually causes abrupt alteration of mental status, althoughviral meningoencephalitis (particularly herpes simplex virus) canpresent with subacute alterations in mental status. The presenceof fever, petechiae, chills, and sweats suggests infection. Prodromal photophobia and pain on movement of the head or eyes aresymptoms of meningeal irritation. Premonitory symptoms, suchas abdominal pain, diarrhea, sore throat, conjunctivitis, cough, orrash, point toward viral encephalitis or a postinfectious syndromeas the cause of the altered consciousness.

CliniCal and laboratory findings Persons with type I GSD may develop hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis during the neonatal period; however, more commonly, they exhibit hepatomegaly at 3–4 months of age. Hypoglycemia, hypoglycemic seizures, and lactic acidosis can develop after a short fast. These children usually have doll-like faces with fat cheeks, relatively thin extremities, short stature, and a protuberant abdomen that is due to massive hepatomegaly. The kidneys are enlarged, but the spleen and heart are of normal size. The hepatocytes are distended by glycogen and fat, with large and

fat, with large and prominent lipid vacuoles. Despite hepatomegaly, liver enzyme levels are usually normal or near normal. Easy bruising and epistaxis are associated with a prolonged bleeding time as a result of impaired platelet aggregation/adhesion. Hyperuricemia is present. Hyperlipidemia includes elevation of triglycerides, low-density lipoproteins, and phospholipids. Type Ib patients have additional findings of neutropenia and impaired neutrophil function, which result in recurrent bacterial infections and oral and intestinal mucosal ulceration. GSD I patients may experience intermittent diarrhea, which can worsen with age. In GSD Ib, diarrhea is

He is now unable to move it. His past medical history is notable for schizophrenia and asthma and he currently takes albuterol as well as another medication whose name he does not remember. His temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 18/min. On physical examination, the patient appears anxious and diaphoretic. He speaks in full sentences and is oriented to person, place, and time. The patient’s neck is flexed and rotated to the right approximately 40 degrees. The right sternocleidomastoid and trapezius are firm and contracted. Extraocular movements are full and intact. Upon further questioning, he reports that he took more medication four hours ago because he was hearing voices. Which of the following should most likely be administered to this patient?

An urgent surgical procedure was performed.

Burr holes were placed around the region of the hematoma and it was evacuated. The small branch of the middle meningeal artery was ligated and the patient spent a few days in the intensive care unit. Fortunately the patient made an uneventful recovery.

A 35-year-old man was involved in a fight and sustained a punch to the right orbit. He came to the emergency department with double vision.

The double vision was only in one plane.

Examination of the orbits revealed that when the patient was asked to look upward the right eye was unable to move superiorly when adducted. There was some limitation in general eye movement. Assessment of the lateral rectus muscle (abducent nerve [VI]), superior oblique muscle (trochlear nerve [IV]), and the rest of the eye muscles (oculomotor nerve [III]) was otherwise unremarkable.

The patient underwent a CT scan.

A CT scan of the facial bones demonstrated a fracture through the floor of the orbit (Fig. 8.293).

A careful review of this CT scan demonstrated that the inferior oblique muscle had been pulled inferiorly with the fragment of bone in the fracture. This produced a tethering effect, so when the patient was asked to gaze in the upward direction, the left eye was able to do so but the right eye was unable to because of the tethered inferior oblique muscle.

The patient underwent surgical exploration to elevate the small bony fragment and return the inferior oblique to its appropriate position. On follow-up the patient had no complications.

A 25-year-old man complained of significant swelling in front of his right ear before and around mealtimes. This swelling was associated with considerable pain, which was provoked by the ingestion of lemon sweets. On examination he had tenderness around the right parotid region and a hard nodule was demonstrated in the buccal mucosa adjacent to the right upper molar teeth.

A diagnosis of parotid duct calculus was made.

FIGURE 157-1 Acute septic arthritis of the sternoclavicular joint.

A man in his forties with a history of cirrhosis presented with a new onset of fever and lower neck pain. He had no history of IV drug use or previous catheter placement. Jaundice and a painful swollen area over his left sternoclavicular joint were evident on physical examination. Cultures of blood drawn at admission grew group B Streptococcus. The patient recovered after treatment with IV penicillin. (Courtesy of Francisco M. Marty, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston; with permission.) common among patients with rheumatoid arthritis and may resemble a flare of the underlying disease.

The usual presentation consists of moderate to severe pain that is uniform around the joint, effusion, muscle spasm, and decreased range of motion. Fever in the range of 38.3–38.9°C (101–102°F) and sometimes higher is common but may not be present, especially in persons with rheumatoid arthritis, renal or hepatic insufficiency, or conditions requiring immunosuppressive therapy. The inflamed, swollen joint is usually evident on examination except in the case of a deeply situated joint such as the hip, shoulder, or sacroiliac joint. Cellulitis, bursitis, and acute osteomyelitis, which may produce a similar clinical picture, should be distinguished from septic arthritis by their greater range of motion and less-than-circumferential swelling. A focus of extraarticular infection, such as a boil or pneumonia, should be sought. Peripheral-blood leukocytosis with a left shift and elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein level are common.

Plain radiographs show evidence of soft-tissue swelling, joint-space widening, and displacement of tissue planes by the distended capsule. Narrowing of the joint space and bony erosions indicate advanced infection and a poor prognosis. Ultrasound is useful for detecting effusions in the hip, and CT or MRI can demonstrate infections of the sacroiliac joint, the sternoclavicular joint, and the spine very well.

document (2) 

Anteroposterior and frog-leg radiographs of the hip are usually normal. Ultrasonography may reveal a joint effusion. It is mandatory to rule out septic arthritis in the presence of effusion with a joint aspiration and cell count.

The mainstay of treatment is bed rest and minimal weight bearing until the pain resolves. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication is usually sufficient to decrease pain. Limiting strenuous activity and exercise for 1 to 2 weeks following recovery is helpful. Follow-up will help ensure that there is no deterioration. Lack of improvement necessitates further evaluation for more serious disorders.

Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCPD) is idiopathic avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis) of the capital epiphysis of the femoral head. The etiology is unclear, but it is likely caused by an interruption of the blood supply to the capital femoral epiphysis. There may be an associated hypercoagulability state (factor V Leiden).

LCPD commonly presents in patients 3 to 12 years of age, with a mean age of 7 years. It is four to five times more common in boys.

Patients may not present for several weeks because of minimaldiscomfort; the classic presentation is a child with an atraumatic, painless limp. There may be mild or intermittent hip/groin, anterior thigh, or knee pain. Decreased internal rotationand abduction with some discomfort, thigh muscle spasm, andanterior thigh muscular atrophy may be present. Patients havedelayed bone age.

Figure 14-5. Dix-Hallpike maneuver to elicit benign positional vertigo (originating in the right ear). A. The maneuver begins with the patient seated and the head turned to one side at 45 degrees, which aligns the right posterior semicircular canal with the sagittal plane of the head.

B. The patient is then helped to recline rapidly so that the head hangs over the edge of the table, still turned 45 degrees from the midline. Within several seconds, this elicits vertigo and nystagmus that is right beating with a rotary (counterclockwise) component. An important feature of this type of “peripheral” vertigo is a change in the direction of nystagmus when the patient sits up again with his head still rotated. If no nystagmus is elicited, the maneuver is repeated after a pause of 30 s, with the head turned to the left. Treatment with the canalith repositioning maneuver is shown in Fig. 14-6.

Radiographic evaluation of these children should include an abdominal CT scan to identify the lesion and to determine the degree of local invasiveness (Fig. 39-40). For malignant appearing lesions, a biopsy should be performed unless the lesion can be completely resected easily.

The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly.

The plasma Na+ concentration on admission was 113 meq/L, with a creatinine of 2.35 (Table 64e-1). At hospital hour 7, the plasma Na+ concentration was 120 meq/L, potassium 5.4 meq/L, chloride 90 64e-5 meq/L, bicarbonate 22 meq/L, BUN 32 mg/dL, creatinine 2.02 mg/dL, glucose 89 mg/dL, total protein 5.0, and albumin 1.9. The hematocrit was 33.9, white count 7.6, and platelets 405. A morning cortisol was 19.5, with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 1.7. The patient was treated with 1 μg of intravenous DDAVP, along with 75 mL/h of intravenous half-normal saline. After the plasma Na+ concentration dropped to 116 meq/L, intravenous fluid was switched to normal saline at the same infusion rate. The subsequent results are shown in Table 64e-1.

This patient presented with hypovolemic hyponatremia and a “prerenal” reduction in GFR, with an increase in serum creatinine. She had experienced diarrhea for some time and manifested an orthostatic tachycardia after a liter of normal saline. As expected for hypovolemic hyponatremia, the urine Na+ concentration was <20 meq/L in the absence of congestive heart failure or other causes of hypervolemic hyponatremia, and she responded to saline hydration with an increase in plasma Na+ concentration and a decrease in creatinine.

A 32-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with weakness and hypokalemia. The patient had been very healthy until 2 months previously when he developed intermittent leg weakness. His review of systems was otherwise negative. He denied drug or laxative abuse and was on no medications. Past medical history was unremarkable, with no history of neuromuscular disease. Family history was notable for a sister with thyroid disease. Physical examination was notable only for reduced deep tendon reflexes.

This patient developed hypokalemia due to a redistribution of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular compartments; this pathophysiology was readily apparent following calculation of the TTKG. The TTKG is calculated as (P × U )/(P ×

U ). The expected values for the TTKG are <3 in the presence of hypokalemia and >7–8 in the presence of hyperkalemia (see also Case 2 and Case 8). Alternatively, a urinary K+-to-creatinine ratio of >13 mmol/g creatinine (>1.5 mmol/mmol creatinine) is compatible with excessive renal K+ excretion. In this case, the calculated TTKG was 2.5, consistent with appropriate renal conservation of K+ and a nonrenal cause for hypokalemia. In the absence of significant gastrointestinal loss of K+, the patient was diagnosed with a “redistributive” subtype of hypokalemia.

A 66-year-old man was admitted to hospital with a plasma K+ concentration of 1.7 meq/L and profound weakness. The patient had noted progressive weakness over several days, to the point that he was unable to rise from bed. Past medical history was notable for small-cell lung cancer with metastases to brain, liver, and adrenals. The patient had been treated with one cycle of cisplatin/etoposide 1 year before this admission, which was complicated by acute kidney injury (peak creatinine of 5, with residual chronic kidney disease), and three subsequent cycles of cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine, in addition to 15 treatments with whole-brain radiation.

On physical examination, the patient was jaundiced. Blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg, increasing to 160/98 mmHg after 1 L of saline, with a JVP at 8 cm. There was generalized muscle weakness.

Hemodialysis is the most effective and reliable method to reduce plasma K+ concentration; peritoneal dialysis is considerably less effective. Patients with acute kidney injury require temporary, urgent venous access for hemodialysis, with the attendant risks; in contrast, patients with ESRD or advanced chronic kidney disease may have a preexisting venous access. The amount of K+ removed during hemodialysis depends on the relative distribution of K+ between ICF and ECF (potentially affected by prior therapy for hyperkalemia), the type and surface area of the dialyzer used, dialysate and blood flow rates, dialysate flow rate, dialysis duration, and the plasma-to-dialysate K+ gradient.

A physical examination in the emergency department indicated postural hypo-tension, tachycardia, and Kussmaul respiration. The breath was noted to smell of “acetone.” Examination of the thorax suggested consolidation in the right lower lobe.

The diagnosis of the acid-base disorder should proceed in a stepwise fashion: 1.

The normal anion gap (AG) is 8–10 meq/L, but in this case, the AG is elevated (20 meq/L). Therefore, the change in AG (ΔAG) = ~10 meq/L.

The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly.

The plasma Na+ concentration on admission was 113 meq/L, with a creatinine of 2.35 (Table 64e-1). At hospital hour 7, the plasma Na+ concentration was 120 meq/L, potassium 5.4 meq/L, chloride 90 64e-5 meq/L, bicarbonate 22 meq/L, BUN 32 mg/dL, creatinine 2.02 mg/dL, glucose 89 mg/dL, total protein 5.0, and albumin 1.9. The hematocrit was 33.9, white count 7.6, and platelets 405. A morning cortisol was 19.5, with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 1.7. The patient was treated with 1 μg of intravenous DDAVP, along with 75 mL/h of intravenous half-normal saline. After the plasma Na+ concentration dropped to 116 meq/L, intravenous fluid was switched to normal saline at the same infusion rate. The subsequent results are shown in Table 64e-1.

This patient presented with hypovolemic hyponatremia and a “prerenal” reduction in GFR, with an increase in serum creatinine. She had experienced diarrhea for some time and manifested an orthostatic tachycardia after a liter of normal saline. As expected for hypovolemic hyponatremia, the urine Na+ concentration was <20 meq/L in the absence of congestive heart failure or other causes of hypervolemic hyponatremia, and she responded to saline hydration with an increase in plasma Na+ concentration and a decrease in creatinine.

A 65-year-old man has a history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease with baseline creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL. Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2–3+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?

Abnormalities in fluid volume and electrolyte composition are common and important clinical disorders. Drugs that block specific transport functions of the renal tubules are valuable clinical tools in the treatment of these disorders. Although various agents that increase urine volume (diuretics) have been described since antiquity, it was not until 1937 that carbonic anhydrase inhibitors were first described and not until 1957 that a much more useful and powerful diuretic agent (chlorothiazide) became available.

The laboratory workup for patients who may have preexisting ﬂuid problems should include assessment of blood hematocrit, serum chemistry, glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, urine osmolarity, and urine electrolyte levels. Serum osmolarity is mainly a function of the concentration of sodium and is given by the following equation: 2[Na+] + glucose (mg/dL)/18 + BUN (mg/dL)/2.8

Normal serum osmolarity is typically 290 to 300 mOsm. Blood hematocrit will rise or fall inversely at a rate of 1% per 500-mL alteration of extracellular ﬂuid volume. The BUN:creatinine ratio is typically 10:1 but will rise to a ratio of greater than 20:1 under conditions of extracellular ﬂuid contraction. Under conditions of extracellular ﬂuid deficit, urine osmolarity will typically be high (>400 mOsm), whereas urine sodium concentration is low (<15 mEq/L), indicative of an attempt by the kidney to conserve sodium. Under conditions of extracellular ﬂuid excess or in cases of renal disease in which the kidney has impaired ability to retain sodium and water, urine osmolarity will be low and urine sodium will be high (>30 mEq/L). Changes in sodium can give insight into the degree of extracellular ﬂuid excess or deficit. In the average person, the serum sodium rises by 3 mmol/L for every liter of water deficit and falls by 3 mmol/L for each liter of water excess. One must be careful in making these estimates because patients with prolonged water and electrolyte loss can have low serum sodium levels and marked water deficits.

Because sodium is the major extracellular cation, shifts in serum sodium levels are usually inversely correlated with the hydration state of the extracellular ﬂuid compartment. The pathophysiology of hyponatremia is usually expansion of body ﬂuids leading to excess total body water (27,33). Symptomatic hyponatremia usually does not occur until the serum sodium is below 120 to 125 mEq/L. The severity of the symptoms (nausea, vomiting, lethargy, seizures) is related more to the rate of change of serum sodium than to the actual serum sodium level.

2023-11-29 14:10:26,858 query: A 5-year-old boy of African descent is presented to the emergency department by his parents. The child is clutching his abdomen and crying about pain in his belly. His mother reports intermittent episodes of jaundice with joint and bone pain since he was 5 months old. At presentation, the patient’s vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals slight jaundice and pale conjunctiva. The spleen is tender and easily palpable. After a complete blood count with differential and an abdominal ultrasound, the patient is found to have sickle-cell disease with splenic infarct. A partial splenectomy is performed. After the operation, the physician provides vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The picture shows a slide obtained from the resected portion of the patient’s spleen. Dysfunction of the zone marked with which number predisposes the patient to the aforementioned infections?

The most serious consequence of splenectomy is increased susceptibility to bacterial infections, particularly those with capsules such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and some gram-negative enteric organisms. Patients under age 20 years are particularly susceptible to overwhelming sepsis with S. pneumoniae, and the overall actuarial risk of sepsis in patients who have had their spleens removed is about 7% in 10 years. The case–fatality rate for pneumococcal sepsis in splenectomized patients is 50–80%. About 25% of patients without spleens will develop a serious infection at some time in their life. The frequency is highest within the first 3 years after splenectomy. About 15% of the infections are polymicrobial, and lung, skin, and blood are the most common sites. No increased risk of viral infection has been noted in patients who have no spleen. The susceptibility to bacterial infections relates to the inability to remove opsonized bacteria from the bloodstream and a defect in making antibodies to T cell–independent antigens such as the polysaccharide components of bacterial capsules. Pneumococcal vaccine should be administered to all patients 2 weeks before elective splenectomy. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that these patients receive repeat vaccination 5 years after splenectomy. Efficacy has not been proven for this group, and the recommendation discounts the possibility that administration of the vaccine may actually lower the titer of specific pneumococcal antibodies. A more effective pneumococcal conjugate vaccine that involves T cells in the response is now available (Prevenar, 7-valent). The vaccine to Neisseria meningitidis should also be given to patients in whom elective splenectomy is planned. Although efficacy data for H. influenzae type b vaccine are not available for older children or adults, it may be given to patients who have had a splenectomy.

Splenectomized patients should be educated to consider any unexplained fever as a medical emergency. Prompt medical attention with evaluation and treatment of suspected bacteremia may be life-saving. Routine chemoprophylaxis with oral penicillin can result in the emergence of drug-resistant strains and is not recommended.

Tuberculous meningitis most commonly occurs in children under 5 years old and often within 6 months of primary infection. Tubercle bacilli that seed the meninges during the primary infection replicate, triggering an inflammatory response. This condition may have an insidious onset, initially characterized by low-grade fever, headache, and subtle personality change. Progression of the infection results in basilar meningitis with impingement of the cranial nerves and is manifested by meningeal irritation and, eventually, increased intracranial pressure, deterioration of mental status, and coma. Computed tomography (CT) scans show hydrocephalus, edema, periventricular lucencies, and infarctions. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis reveals pleocytosis (50 to 500 leukocytes/mm3), which early in the course of disease may be either lymphocytes or polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Glucose is low, and protein is significantly elevated. Acid-fast bacilli are not detected frequently in the CSF by either routine or fluorescent staining procedures. Although culture is the standard for diagnosis, PCR for M. tuberculosis is useful to confirm meningitis.

Skeletal tuberculosis results from either hematogenous seeding or direct extension from a caseous lymph node. This is usually a chronic disease with an insidious onset that may be mistaken for chronic osteomyelitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Radiographs reveal cortical destruction. Biopsy and culture are essential for proper diagnosis. Tuberculosis of the spine, Pott’s disease, is the most common skeletal site followed by the hip as well as fingers and toes (dactylitis).

Other forms of tuberculosis include abdominal tuberculosis that occurs from swallowing infected material. This is a relatively uncommon complication in developed nations where dairy herds are inspected for bovine tuberculosis. Tuberculous peritonitis is associated with abdominal tuberculosis and presents as fever, anorexia, ascites, and abdominal pain. Urogenital tuberculosis is a late reactivation complication and is rare in children. Symptomatic illness presents as dysuria, frequency, urgency, hematuria, and sterile pyuria.

Bacterial meningitis most often occurs in children < 3 years of age; common organisms include S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, and E. coli. Enteroviruses are the most common agents of viral meningitis and occur in children of all ages. Risk factors include sinofacial infections, trauma, and sepsis.

■Bacterial meningitis classically presents with the triad of headache, high fever, and nuchal rigidity.

The presence of numerous neutrophils in sputum containing the typical gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci supports the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia, but it must be remembered that S. pneumoniae is a part of the endogenous flora in 20% of adults, and therefore false-positive results may be obtained. Isolation of pneumococci from blood cultures is more specific but less sensitive (in the early phase of illness, only 20% to 30% of patients have positive blood cultures). Pneumococcal vaccines containing capsular polysaccharides from the common serotypes are used in individuals at high risk for pneumococcal sepsis.

Both encapsulated and unencapsulated forms of H. influenzae are important causes of community-acquired pneumonias. The former can cause a particularly life-threatening form of pneumonia in children, often after a respiratory viral infection. Adults at risk for developing infections include those with chronic pulmonary diseases such as chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, and bronchiectasis. H. influenzae is the most common bacterial cause of acute exacerbations of COPD. Encapsulated H. influenzae type b was formerly an important cause of epiglottitis and suppurative meningitis in children, but vaccination against this organism in infancy has significantly reduced the risk.

The typical age of presentation is 30–50 years, and males predominate. The clinical presentation is usually insidious and is manifested by progressive exertional dyspnea, fatigue, weight loss, and low-grade fever. A nonproductive cough is common, but occasionally expectoration of “chunky” gelatinous material may occur. Polycythemia, hypergammaglobulinemia, and increased LDH levels are common. Markedly elevated serum levels of lung surfactant proteins A and D have been found in PAP. In the absence of any known secondary cause of PAP, an elevated serum anti-GM-CSF titer is highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of acquired PAP. BAL fluid levels of anti-GM-CSF antibodies correlate better with the severity of PAP than do serum titers. Radiographically, bilateral symmetric alveolar opacities located centrally in middle and lower lung zones result in a “bat-wing” distribution. HRCT shows a ground-glass opacification and thickened intralobular structures and interlobular septa.

Histologic Findings This diffuse disease is characterized by the accumulation of an amorphous, periodic acid–Schiff–positive lipoproteinaceous material in the distal air spaces. There is little or no lung inflammation, and the underlying lung architecture is preserved.

Treatment Whole-lung lavage(s) through a double-lumen endotracheal tube provides relief to many patients with dyspnea or progressive hypoxemia and also may provide long-term benefit.

Pediatric celiac disease, which affects male and female children equally, may manifest with classic symptoms, typically between 6 and 24 months of age (after introduction of gluten to the diet) with irritability, abdominal distention, anorexia, diarrhea, failure to thrive, weight loss, or muscle wasting. Children with nonclassic symptoms tend to present at older ages with complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, bloating, or constipation. A characteristic pruritic, blistering skin lesion, dermatitis herpetiformis, is also present in as many as 10% of patients, and the incidence of lymphocytic gastritis and lymphocytic colitis is increased as well.

In adults, celiac disease manifests most commonly between 30 and 60 years of age. However, many cases escape clinical attention for extended periods because of atypical presentations. Some patients have silent celiac disease, defined as positive serology and villous atrophy without symptoms, or latent celiac disease, in which positive serology is accompanied neither by villous atrophy nor symptoms. Symptomatic adult celiac disease is often associated with anemia (due to iron deficiency and, less commonly, B12 and folate deficiency), diarrhea, bloating, and fatigue.

Treatment of all forms of hypoglycemia obviously consists of correction of the hypoglycemia at the earliest possible moment. It is not known whether hypothermia or other measures will increase the safety period in hypoglycemia or alter the outcome. Seizures and twitching may not stop with antiepileptic drugs until the hypoglycemia is corrected.

Two syndromes have been defined, mainly in diabetics: (1) hyperglycemia with ketoacidosis and (2) hyperosmolar nonketotic hyperglycemia.

In diabetic acidosis, the familiar picture is one of dehydration, fatigue, weakness, headache, abdominal pain, dryness of the mouth, stupor or coma, and Kussmaul type of breathing. Usually the condition has developed over a period of days in a patient known or proven to be diabetic. Often, the patient had failed to take a regular insulin dose. The blood glucose level is found to be more than 400 mg/dL, the pH of the blood less than 7.20, and the bicarbonate less than 10 mEq/L. Ketone bodies and b-hydroxybutyric acid are elevated in the blood and urine, and there is marked glycosuria. The prompt administration of insulin and repletion of intravascular volume correct the clinical and chemical abnormalities over a period of hours.

The patient should be started on four-drug therapy with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. He should also be started on antiretroviral therapy for HIV. If a protease-inhibitor-based antiretroviral regimen is used to treat his HIV, rifabutin should replace rifampin because of the serious drug-drug interactions between rifampin and protease inhibitors. If dolutegravir is chosen, it must be administered twice daily due to the interaction with rifampin; alternatively, rifabutin can be used in place of rifampin, and dolutegravir can be dosed once daily. The patient is at increased risk of developing hepatotoxicity from both isoniazid and pyrazinamide given his history of alcohol use.

The patient is a 37-year-old African-American man who lives in San Jose, California. He was recently incarcerated near Bakersfield, California and returned to Oakland about 3 months ago. He is currently experiencing one month of severe headache and double vision. He has a temperature of 38.6°C (101.5°F) and the physical exam reveals nuchal rigidity and right-sided sixth cranial nerve palsy. MRI of his brain is normal, and lumbar puncture reveals 330 WBC with 20% eosinophils, protein 75, and glucose 20. HIV test is negative, TB skin test is negative, CSF cryptococcal antigen is negative, and CSF gram stain is negative. Patient receives empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis with van-comycin and ceftriaxone, and is unimproved after 72 hours of treatment. After 3 days a white mold is identified growing from his CSF culture. What medical therapy would be most appropriate now?

Human fungal infections have increased dramatically in incidence and severity in recent years, owing mainly to advances in surgery, cancer treatment, treatment of patients with solid organ and bone marrow transplantation, the HIV epidemic, and increasing use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy in critically ill patients. These changes have resulted in increased numbers of patients at risk for fungal infections.

Isolation from the blood or CSF of a resistant organism requires the use of ceftriaxone with the addition of vancomycin and rifampin. N. meningitidis, at least in the United States, remains highly susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin. Regional variations and ongoing antibiotic-induced changes in the infecting microorganisms underscore the need for constant awareness of drug resistance in the physician’s local area, especially in the case of pneumococcal infections. Throughout the course of treatment, it is necessary to have access to a laboratory that can carry out rapid and detailed drug-resistance testing.

Nosocomial meningitis In cases of meningitis caused by coagulase-positive S. aureus, including those that occur after neurosurgery or major head injury, administration of vancomycin plus a third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., cefepime, ceftazadime, or meropenem) is a reasonable first approach. If Pseudomonas is considered possible, such as after neurosurgery, an antipseudomonal cephalosporin such as ceftazidime or cefepime should be added. Once the sensitivity of the organism has been determined, therapy may have to be altered or may be simplified by using vancomycin or nafcillin alone. These approaches have been reviewd by van de Beek and colleagues (2010). They note that the CSF cell count may be low in cases of ventricular catheter-associated meningitis. They also provide recommendations on the use of prophylactic antibiotics after a basilar skull fracture, a controversial problem that is reviewed in Chap. 34.

Risk factors for TB exposure include homelessness and crowded living conditions (e.g., prison), immigration/travel from developing nations, working in an allied health profession, and interacting with known TB contacts.

Presents with cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, fever, cachexia, hypoxia, tachycardia, lymphadenopathy, an abnormal lung exam, and a prolonged (> 3-week) symptom duration. TB is a common cause of fever of unknown origin (FUO). HIV patients can present with atypical signs and symptoms and have higher rates of extrapulmonary TB.

■ Active disease: Mycobacterial culture of sputum (or blood/tissue for extrapulmonary disease) is the gold standard but can take weeks to obtain. A sputum acid-fast stain (see Figure 2.8-3) can yield rapid preliminary results but lacks sensitivity.

Three A.M. sputum samples for AFB stain and a mycobacterial culture are advised. If the results of the stain are but there is a high degree of clinical suspicion, proceed to bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage or biopsy. HIV patients have a high rate of  sputum stains (i.e., a

AFB smear accompanied by a culture).

The most common fnding among typical hosts is a cavitary inf ltrate in the upper lobe on CXR. HIV patients or those with 1° TB may show lower lobe infltrates with or without cavitation. Multiple f ne nodular

Otitis Media Otitis media remains primarily a disease of children, but may affect adults, often secondary to a concurrent viral infection of the upper respiratory tract. Diagnosis in most cases reveals ﬂuid behind the tympanic membrane. Treatment is directed to symptoms and involves the use of antihistamines and decongestants, despite few data to support their use. Acute otitis media is usually a bacterial infection; Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus inﬂuenza are the most common pathogens. Symptoms include acute purulent otorrhea, fever, hearing loss, and leukocytosis. Physical examination of the ear reveals a red, bulging, or perforated membrane. Indicated treatment is broad-spectrum antibiotics such as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefuroxime axetil, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Bronchitis Acute bronchitis is an inﬂammatory condition of the tracheobronchial tree. Most often it is viral in origin and occurs in winter. Common cold viruses (rhinovirus and coronavirus), adenovirus, inﬂuenza virus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (a nonviral pathogen) are the most common pathogens involved. Bacterial infections occur less commonly and may be secondary pathogens. Cough, hoarseness, and fever are the usual presenting symptoms. In the initial 3 to 4 days, the symptoms of rhinitis and sore throat are prominent; coughing may last as long as 3 weeks. The prolonged nature of these infections promotes the use of antibiotics to “clear up the infection” (8). Sputum production commonly occurs and may be prolonged in cigarette smokers. Most serious bacterial infections occur in cigarette smokers, who have damage to the lining of the upper respiratory tree and changes in the host ﬂora.

This type of inflammatory disease of cranial arteries is an important cause of headache in older persons. All of our patients have been older than 55 years of age, most of them older than age 65. From a state of normal health, the patient develops an increasingly intense throbbing or nonthrobbing headache, often with superimposed sharp, stabbing pains. In a few patients the headache has had an almost explosive onset. The pain is usually unilateral, sometimes bilateral, and often localized to the site of the affected arteries in the scalp. The pain persists to some degree throughout the day and is particularly severe at night. It lasts for many months if untreated. The superficial temporal and other scalp arteries are frequently thickened and tender and without pulsation. Jaw claudication and ischemic nodules on the scalp, with ulceration of the overlying skin, have been described in severe cases.

Many of the patients feel generally unwell and have lost weight; some have a low-grade fever and anemia. Usually the sedimentation rate is greatly elevated (>50 mm/h and typically >75 mm/h) but elevation of the C-reactive protein (CRP) level is a more sensitive indicator of this inflammatory condition and is particularly helpful when the sedimentation rate is only mildly elevated. A few patients have a peripheral neutrophilic leukocytosis. Half of patients have generalized aching of proximal limb muscles, reflecting the presence of polymyalgia rheumatica (see Chap. 45, “Polymyalgia Rheumatica”). A relation of temporal arteritis to herpes zoster has been proposed.

The importance of early diagnosis relates to the threat of blindness from thrombosis of the ophthalmic or posterior ciliary arteries. This may be preceded by several episodes of amaurosis fugax (transient monocular blindness). Ophthalmoplegia may also occur but is less frequent, and its cause, whether neural or muscular, is not settled.

Heat edema is characterized by mild swelling of the hands, feet, and ankles during the first few days of significant heat exposure. The principal mechanism involves cutaneous vasodilation and pooling of interstitial fluid in response to heat stress. Heat also increases the secretion of antidiuretic hormone and aldosterone. Systemic causes of edema, including cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, and congestive heart failure, can usually be excluded by the history and physical examination. Heat edema generally resolves without treatment in several days. Diuretics are not effective and, in fact, predispose to volume depletion and the development of more serious heat-related illnesses.

Prickly heat (miliaria rubra, lichen tropicus) is a maculopapular, pruritic, erythematous rash that commonly occurs in clothed areas. Blockage of the sweat pores by debris from macerated stratum corneum causes inflammation in the sweat ducts. As the ducts dilate, they rupture and produce superficial vesicles. The predominant symptom is pruritus. In addition to antihistamines, chlorhexidine may provide some relief. Localized areas may benefit from 1% salicylic acid, with caution taken to avoid salicylate intoxication. Clothing should be clean and loose fitting, and activities or environments that induce diaphoresis should be avoided.

Heat syncope (exercise-associated collapse) can follow endurance exercise or can occur in the elderly. Other common clinical scenarios include prolonged standing while stationary in the heat and sudden standing after prolonged exposure to heat. Heat stress routinely causes relative volume depletion, decreased vasomotor tone, and peripheral vasodilation. The cumulative effect of this decrease in venous return is postural hypotension, especially in nonacclimated elderly individuals. Many of those affected also have comorbidities. Therefore, other cardiovascular, neurologic, and metabolic causes of syncope should be considered. After removal from the heat source, most patients will recover promptly with cooling and rehydration.

Diagnosed according to the clinical picture. Skin biopsy shows a subepidermal blister, often with an eosinophil-rich infiltrate. Immunoﬂ uorescence demonstrates linear IgG and C3 immunoglobulin and complement at the dermal-epidermal junction.

Systemic corticosteroids. Topical corticosteroids can help prevent blister formation when applied to early lesions.

A painful, recurrent vesicular eruption of the mucocutaneous surfaces due to infection with HSV. HSV-1 usually produces oral-labial lesions, whereas HSV-2 usually causes genital lesions. The virus spreads through epidermal cells, causing them to fuse into giant cells. The local host inﬂ ammatory response leads to erythema and swelling.

The initial infection is passed by direct contact, after which the herpesvirus remains dormant in local nerve ganglia. 1° episodes are generally longer and more severe than recurrences.

Onset is preceded by prodromal tingling, burning, or pain but can also present with lymphadenopathy, fever, discomfort, malaise, and edema of involved tissue.

Recurrences are limited to mucocutaneous areas innervated by the involved nerve.

Recurrent oral herpes (HSV-1): Typically consists of the common “cold sore,” which presents as a cluster of crusted vesicles on an erythematous base (see Figure 2.2-8A). It is often triggered by sun and fever.

Recurrent genital herpes (HSV-2): Unilateral and characterized by a cluster of blisters on an erythematous base, but with less pain and systemic involvement than the 1° infection.

Diagnosed primarily by the clinical picture. Multinucleated giant cells on Tzanck smear (see Figure 2.2-8B) yield a presumptive diagnosis.

VZV has the same appearance on Tzanck, so culture or direct ﬂ uorescent antibody staining is needed for definitive diagnosis.

are cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and the pathognomonic Koplik spots (gray-white, sand grain-sized dots on the buccal mucosa opposite the lower molars) that last 12 to 24 hours. The conjunctiva may reveal a characteristic transverse line of inflammation along the eyelid margin (Stimson line). The classic symptoms of cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis occur during the secondary viremia of the exanthematous phase, which often is accompanied by high fever (40° C to 40.5° C [104° F to 105° F]). The macular rash begins on the head (often above the hairline) and spreads over most of the body in a cephalad to caudal pattern over 24 hours. Areas of the rash often are confluent. The rash fades in the same pattern, and illness severity is related to the extent of the rash. It may be petechial or hemorrhagic (black measles). As the rash fades, it undergoes brownish discoloration and desquamation.

Cervical lymphadenitis, splenomegaly, and mesenteric lymphadenopathy with abdominal pain may be noted with the rash. Otitis media, pneumonia, and diarrhea are more common in infants. Liver involvement is more common in adults.

The term modified measles describes mild cases of measles occurring in persons with partial protection against measles. Modified measles occurs in persons vaccinated before 12 months of age or with coadministration of immune serum globulin, in infants with disease modified by transplacental antibody, or in persons receiving immunoglobulin.

and prolonged survival. Prospectively controlled trials have shown a statistically significant reduction in mortality rate from colorectal cancer for individuals undergoing annual stool guaiac screening. However, this benefit only emerged after >13 years of follow-up and was extremely expensive to achieve, because all positive tests (most of which were falsely positive) were followed by colonoscopy. Moreover, these colonoscopic examinations quite likely provided the opportunity for cancer prevention through the removal of potentially premalignant adenomatous polyps (i.e., computed tomography colonography) because the eventual development of cancer was reduced by 20% in the cohort undergoing annual screening.

Signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary depending on the infecting organism and the patient’s immune status. In typical pneumonias, the usual presentation is a patient with high fever, rigors, productive cough, chills, and pleuritic chest pain. Chest radiography often will show infiltrates (11). The following agents, listed in decreasing order, cause two-thirds of all bacterial pneumonias: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus inﬂuenza, Klebsiella pneumoniae, gram-negative organisms, and anaerobic bacteria. Atypical pneumonias are more insidious in onset than typical pneumonias. Patients have moderate fever without the characteristic rigors and chills. Additional symptoms include a nonproductive cough, headache, myalgias, and mild leukocytosis. Chest radiography reveals bronchopneumonia with a diffuse interstitial pattern; characteristically, the patient does not appear to be as ill as the x-ray suggests. Common causes of atypical pneumonia include viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia pneumoniae (also called the TWAR agent), and other rare agents.

A strong index of suspicion is required for diagnosis, especially in elderly and immunocompromised individuals, who have altered response mechanisms. This is true with “typical agents.” Subtle clues in the elderly include changes in mentation, confusion, and exacerbation of other illnesses. The febrile response may be entirely absent, and the results of the physical examination are not predictive of pneumonia. In high-risk groups, an increased respiratory rate of greater than 25 breaths per minute remains the most reliable sign of infection. Mortality in these high-risk groups of patients is strongly correlated with the ability of the host to mount normal defenses to the symptoms of fever, chills, and tachycardia.

All women suspected of having pneumonia should undergo chest radiography to establish the diagnosis and to detect alternate diagnoses such as congestive heart failure and tumors.

Asbestosis is a diffuse interstitial fibrosing disease of the lung that is directly related to the intensity and duration of exposure. The disease resembles other forms of diffuse interstitial fibrosis (Chap. 315). Usually, exposure has taken place for at least 10 years before the disease becomes manifest. The mechanisms by which asbestos fibers induce lung fibrosis are not completely understood but are known to involve oxidative injury due to the generation of reactive oxygen species by the transition metals on the surface of the fibers as well as from cells engaged in phagocytosis.

Past exposure to asbestos is specifically indicated by pleural plaques on chest radiographs, which are characterized by either thickening or calcification along the parietal pleura, particularly along the lower lung fields, the diaphragm, and the cardiac border. Without additional manifestations, pleural plaques imply only exposure, not pulmonary impairment. Benign pleural effusions also may occur. The fluid is typically a serous or bloody exudate. The effusion may be slowly progressive or may resolve spontaneously.

Irregular or linear opacities that usually are first noted in the lower lung fields are the chest radiographic hallmark of asbestosis. An indistinct heart border or a “ground-glass” appearance in the lung fields may be seen. HRCT may show distinct changes of subpleural curvilinear lines 5–10 mm in length that appear to be parallel to the pleural surface (Fig. 311-1).

Pulmonary function testing in asbestosis reveals a restrictive pattern with a decrease in both lung volumes and diffusing capacity. There may also be evidence of mild airflow obstruction (due to peribronchiolar fibrosis).

Because no specific therapy is available for asbestosis, supportive care is the same as that given to any patient with diffuse interstitial fibrosis of any cause. In general, newly diagnosed cases will have resulted from exposures that occurred many years before.

Pneumonia Pneumonia is defined as inﬂammation of the distal lung that includes terminal airways, alveolar spaces, and the interstitium. Pneumonia may have multiple causes, including viral and bacterial infections or aspiration. Aspiration pneumonia is usually the result of depressed awareness commonly associated with the use of drugs and alcohol or anesthesia. Viral pneumonias are caused by multiple infectious agents, including inﬂuenza A or B, parainﬂuenza virus, or respiratory syncytial virus. Most viral syndromes are spread by aerosolization associated with coughing, sneezing, and even conversation. Incubation is short, requiring only 1 to 3 days before the acute onset of fever, chills, headache, fatigue, and myalgias. Symptom intensity is directly related to intensity of the host febrile reaction. Pneumonia develops in only 1% of patients who have a viral syndrome, but mortality rates may reach 30% in immunocompromised individuals and the elderly. An additional risk is the development of secondary bacterial pneumonias after the initial viral insult. These infections are more common in elderly patients and may explain the high fatality in this group (8). Staphylococcal pneumonias, which often arise from a previous viral infection, are extremely lethal regardless of patient age. The best treatment for viral pneumonia is prevention by immunization. Treatment is supportive and consists mostly of administration of antipyretics and ﬂuids.

Bacterial pneumonia is classified as either community acquired or nosocomial, and in many cases the classification determines prognosis and antibiotic therapy. Risk factors that contribute to mortality are chronic cardiopulmonary diseases, alcoholism, diabetes, renal failure, malignancy, and malnutrition. Prognostic features associated with poor outcome include greater than two lobe involvement, respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths per minute on presentation, severe hypoxemia (<60 mm Hg on room air), hypoalbuminemia, and septicemia. Pneumonia is a common cause of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a mortality rate between 50% and 70% (9,10).

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS upper Respiratory Tract Infections and Pneumonia Acute M. pneumoniae infections generally manifest as pharyngitis, tracheobronchitis, reactive airway disease/wheezing, or a nonspecific upper respiratory syndrome. Little evidence supports the commonly held belief that this organism is an important cause of otitis media, with or without bullous myringitis. Pneumonia develops in 3–13% of infected individuals; its onset is usually gradual, occurring over several days, but may be more abrupt. Although Mycoplasma pneumonia may begin with a sore throat, the most common presenting symptom is cough. The cough is typically nonproductive, but some patients produce sputum. Headache, malaise, chills, and fever are noted in the majority of patients.

On physical examination, wheezes or rales are detected in ∼80% of patients with M. pneumoniae pneumonia. In many patients, however, pneumonia can be diagnosed only by chest radiography. The most common radiographic pattern is that of peribronchial pneumonia with thickened bronchial markings, streaks of interstitial infiltration, and areas of subsegmental atelectasis. Segmental or lobar consolidation is not uncommon. While clinically evident pleural effusions are infrequent, lateral decubitus views reveal that up to 20% of patients have pleural effusions.

Overall, the clinical presentation of pneumonia in an individual patient is not useful for differentiating M. pneumoniae pneumonia from other types of community-acquired pneumonia. The possibility of M. pneumoniae infection deserves particular consideration when community-acquired pneumonia fails to respond to treatment with a penicillin or a cephalosporin—antibiotics that are ineffective against mycoplasmas. Symptoms usually resolve within 2–3 weeks after the onset of illness. Although M. pneumoniae pneumonia is generally self-limited, appropriate antimicrobial therapy significantly shortens the duration of clinical illness. Infection uncommonly results in critical illness and only rarely in death. In some patients, long-term recurrent wheezing or reactive airway disease may follow the resolution of acute pneumonia. The significance of chronic infection, especially as it relates to asthma, is an area of active investigation.

Many times the primary disorder underlying coma is perfectly obvious, as with severe cranial trauma or a known drug overdose. All too often, however, the comatose patient is brought to the hospital and little pertinent medical information is available. The need for efficiency in reaching a diagnosis and providing appropriate acute care demands that the physician have a methodical approach that first addresses the common and treatable causes of coma. When the comatose patient is first seen, the patient’s airway is cleared and blood pressure is restored; if trauma has occurred, one must check for bleeding from a wound or ruptured organ (e.g., spleen or liver). With hypotension, placement of a central venous line and administration of fluids and pressor agents, oxygen, blood, or glucose solutions (preferably after blood is drawn for glucose determinations and thiamine is administered) take precedence over diagnostic procedures. If respirations are shallow or labored, or if there is emesis with a threat of aspiration, tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are instituted. An oropharyngeal airway is otherwise adequate in a comatose patient who is breathing normally. Deeply comatose patients with shallow respirations require endotracheal intubation. The patient with a head injury may also have suffered a fracture of the cervical vertebrae, in which case caution must be exercised in moving the head and neck as well as in intubation lest the spinal cord be inadvertently damaged. These matters are discussed in detail further on, under “Management of the Acutely Comatose Patient.”

An inquiry is then made as to the circumstances in which the person was found and their previous health, whether there was a history of diabetes, a head injury, a convulsion, alcohol or drug use, or a prior episode of coma or attempted suicide. Persons who accompany the comatose patient to the hospital should be encouraged to remain until they have been questioned. In addition to the basic laboratory tests that apply to coma, a toxicology screen is usually appropriate.

The distal lumen of the catheter, which is beyond the balloon, measures left atrial pressure (LAP) and, in the absence of mitral valvular disease, LAP approximates LVEDP. Pulmonary–capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) equals the LAP, which equals LVEDP and is normal at 8 to 12 mm Hg. Because the standard pulmonary artery catheter has an incorporated thermistor, thermodilution studies can be performed to determine cardiac output. This thermodilution method is performed by injecting cold 5% dextrose in water through the proximal port of the catheter, which cools the blood entering the right atrium. The change in temperature measured at the more distal thermistor (4 cm from the catheter tip) generates a curve proportional to cardiac output. Knowledge of the cardiac output is helpful in establishing cardiovascular diagnoses. For example, a patient with hypotension, low-to-normal wedge pressure, and a cardiac output of 3 L per minute is most likely hypovolemic. The same patient with a cardiac output of 8 L per minute is probably septic with resultant low systemic vascular resistance.

Pulmonary artery catheters are associated with a small but significant complication rate. The complications can be grouped into those occurring during venous cannulation or insertion, during maintenance and use, and those related to interpretation of hemodynamic data (210). The most common problems encountered during venous access are cannulation of the carotid or subclavian artery and introduction of a pneumothorax. Problems resulting from the catheter itself include dysrhythmias, sepsis, and disruption of the pulmonary artery. Pulmonary artery catheters (PAC) should be placed under the supervision of experienced personnel in a setting in which complications can be rapidly diagnosed and treated. Accessory equipment such as resuscitation equipment and an external pacing device must be immediately available. Ultrasound and ﬂuoroscopic equipment if available may aid in PAC placement (211).

If open pneumothorax is identified, an occlusive dressing must be applied immediately. This must be secured on three sides only to prevent the development of tension pneumothorax.

Massive hemothorax is diagnosed through chest tube placement and is defined as > 1000 cc of immediate blood return or > 200/hour for > 2–4 hours. The treatment for massive hemothorax is volume resuscitation followed by surgery to repair the site of bleeding. The treatment for ﬂail chest is supportive, followed by surgical fixation of the chest wall.

Circulation:

Apply direct pressure to any actively bleeding wounds.

Place a 16-gauge IV in each antecubital fossa.

Isotonic ﬂuids (LR or NS) are repleted in a 3:1 ratio (ﬂuid to blood loss). Start with a ﬂuid bolus of 1–2 L in adults; then recheck vitals and continue repletion as indicated.

If the patient remains tachycardic or hypotensive after the first 2 L of isotonic ﬂuid, transfusion with packed RBCs may be indicated.

To remember the Glasgow Coma Scale, think 4-eyes, Jackson-5, V6 engine. Four points can be assigned for eye response, five points for verbal response, and six points for motor response.

Patients with chest trauma and shock may have cardiac tamponade. The relevant signs are JVD, hypotension, and mufﬂed heart sounds. This can be diagnosed with bedside ultrasound. If tamponade is diagnosed, an immediate pericardiocentesis is necessary.

Disability/Exposure:

Disability (CNS dysfunction) is assessed and quantified with the GCS.

Exposure requires that the patient be completely disrobed and assessed for injury and temperature status on both the front and back of the body. Hypothermia is a common problem in trauma and can worsen bleeding; once the exam is done, the patient should be covered with warm blankets.

Once the patient is stable, conduct a full examination.

This is particularly true for penetrating injuries of the neck, thoracic outlet, and groin, where bleeding may be torrential and aris-ing deep within the wound. In these situations, a gloved finger placed through the wound directly onto the bleeding vessel can apply enough pressure to control active bleeding. The surgeon performing this maneuver must then walk with the patient to the OR for definitive treatment. For bleeding of the extremi-ties, it is tempting to apply tourniquets for hemorrhage control, Figure 7-7. Saphenous vein cutdowns are excellent sites for fluid resuscitation access. A.

Predominantly a clinical diagnosis; routine cases do not need blood work or a CXR.

CXR may be obtained to rule out pneumonia and may show hyperinﬂ ation of the lungs with ﬂattened diaphragms, interstitial infiltrates, and atelectasis.

Nasopharyngeal aspirate to test for RSV is highly sensitive and specific but has little effect on management (infants should be treated for bronchiolitis regardless of whether RSV is or not).

Treatment is primarily supportive; treat mild disease with outpatient management using ﬂuids and nebulizers if needed.

Hospitalize in the setting of marked respiratory distress, O2 saturation of < 92%, toxic appearance, dehydration/poor oral feeding, a history of prematurity (< 34 weeks), age < 3 months, underlying cardiopulmonary disease, or unreliable parents.

Treat inpatients with contact isolation, hydration, and O2. A trial of aerosolized albuterol may be attempted; continue albuterol therapy only if effective.

RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis.

Ribavirin is an antiviral drug that has a controversial role in bronchiolitis treatment. It is sometimes used in high-risk infants with underlying heart, lung, or immune disease.

RSV prophylaxis with injectable polyor monoclonal antibodies (RespiGam or Synagis) is recommended in winter for high-risk patients ≤ 2 years of age (e.g., those with a history of prematurity, chronic lung disease, or congenital heart disease).

An acute viral inﬂammatory disease of the larynx, primarily within the subglottic space. Pathogens include parainf uenza virus type 1 (most common), 2, and 3; RSV; inﬂuenza; and adenovirus. Bacterial superinfection may progress to tracheitis.

Prodromal URI symptoms are typically followed by low-grade fever, mild dyspnea, inspiratory stridor that worsens with agitation, a hoarse voice, and a characteristic barking cough (usually at night).

Kernig’s sign (pain on knee extension when the hip is ﬂexed) and Brudzinski’s sign (pain with passive neck ﬂexion) are nonspecific signs of meningeal irritation.

Additional physical exam findings may include signs of ↑ ICP (papilledema, cranial nerve palsies) or petechial rash (N. meningitidis). Signs in neonates include lethargy, hyperor hypothermia, poor tone, a bulging fontanelle, and vomiting.

Head CT to rule out ↑ ICP (risk of brain stem herniation).

Perform an LP; send cell count with differential, glucose and protein levels, Gram stain, and culture.

Empiric antibiotic therapy regimens (ceftriaxone, vancomycin, ampicillin) should be administered until bacterial meningitis can be excluded.

Neonates should receive ampicillin and cefotaxime or gentamicin. Consider acyclovir if there is concern for herpes encephalitis (e.g., if the mother had HSV lesions at the time of the infant’s birth).

Older children should receive ceftriaxone and vancomycin.

A bacterial infection caused by Bordetella pertussis (whooping cough), a grambacillus. The DTaP vaccine (given in five doses in early childhood) is protective, but immunity wanes by adolescence. Adolescents and young adults serve as the primary reservoir for pertussis. Pertussis can be life threatening for young infants but is generally a milder infection in older children and adults.

Has three stages: (1) catarrhal (mild URI symptoms; lasts 1–2 weeks), (2) paroxysmal (paroxysms of cough with inspiratory whoop and post-tussive emesis; lasts 2–3 months), and (3) convalescent (symptoms wane).

Patients most often present in the paroxysmal stage but are most contagious in the catarrhal stage.

The classic presentation is an infant < 6 months of age with post-tussive emesis and apnea.

Otitis Media Otitis media remains primarily a disease of children, but may affect adults, often secondary to a concurrent viral infection of the upper respiratory tract. Diagnosis in most cases reveals ﬂuid behind the tympanic membrane. Treatment is directed to symptoms and involves the use of antihistamines and decongestants, despite few data to support their use. Acute otitis media is usually a bacterial infection; Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus inﬂuenza are the most common pathogens. Symptoms include acute purulent otorrhea, fever, hearing loss, and leukocytosis. Physical examination of the ear reveals a red, bulging, or perforated membrane. Indicated treatment is broad-spectrum antibiotics such as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefuroxime axetil, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Bronchitis Acute bronchitis is an inﬂammatory condition of the tracheobronchial tree. Most often it is viral in origin and occurs in winter. Common cold viruses (rhinovirus and coronavirus), adenovirus, inﬂuenza virus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (a nonviral pathogen) are the most common pathogens involved. Bacterial infections occur less commonly and may be secondary pathogens. Cough, hoarseness, and fever are the usual presenting symptoms. In the initial 3 to 4 days, the symptoms of rhinitis and sore throat are prominent; coughing may last as long as 3 weeks. The prolonged nature of these infections promotes the use of antibiotics to “clear up the infection” (8). Sputum production commonly occurs and may be prolonged in cigarette smokers. Most serious bacterial infections occur in cigarette smokers, who have damage to the lining of the upper respiratory tree and changes in the host ﬂora.

The incubation period is 1–4 days. Symptoms include sore throat, fever and chills, malaise, and sometimes abdominal complaints and vomiting, particularly in children. Both symptoms and signs are quite variable, ranging from mild throat discomfort with minimal physical findings to high fever and severe sore throat associated with intense erythema and swelling of the pharyngeal mucosa and the presence of purulent exudate over the posterior pharyngeal wall and tonsillar pillars. Enlarged, tender anterior cervical lymph nodes commonly accompany exudative pharyngitis.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Pharyngitis Although seen in patients of all ages, GAS pharyngitis is one of the most common bacterial infections of childhood, accounting for 20–40% of all cases of exudative pharyngitis in children; it is rare among those under the age of 3. Younger children may manifest streptococcal infection with a syndrome of fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy without exudative pharyngitis. Infection is acquired through contact with another individual carrying the organism. Respiratory droplets are the usual mechanism of spread, although other routes, including food-borne outbreaks, have been well described. The incubation period is

Clinical Features of Hypoxic Encephalopathy

Mild degrees of hypoxia without loss of consciousness induce only inattentiveness, poor judgment, and incoordination; in our experience, there have been no or minimal lasting clinical effects in such cases, although Hornbein and colleagues found a slight decline in visual and verbal long-term memory and mild aphasic errors in Himalayan mountaineers who had earlier ascended to altitudes of 18,000 to 29,000 ft. These observations make the point that profound anoxia may be well tolerated if arrived at gradually. For example, we have seen several patients with advanced pulmonary disease who were fully awake when their arterial oxygen pressure was in the range of 30 mm Hg. This level, if it occurs abruptly, causes coma. An important derivative observation is that degrees of hypoxia that at no time abolish consciousness rarely, if ever, cause permanent damage to the nervous system.

In the circumstances of severe global ischemia with prolonged loss of consciousness, the clinical effects can be quite variable. Following cardiac arrest, for example, consciousness is lost within seconds but recovery can be complete if breathing, oxygenation, and cardiac action are restored within 3 to 5 min. Beyond 5 min there is usually permanent injury. Clinically, however, it is often difficult to judge the precise degree and duration of ischemia, because slight heart action or an imperceptible blood pressure may have served to maintain the circulation to some extent. Hence some individuals have made an excellent recovery after cerebral ischemia that apparently lasted 8 to 10 min or longer. Subnormal body temperatures, as might occur when the body is immersed in ice-cold water, greatly prolong the tolerable period of hypoxia. This has led to the successful application of moderate cooling after cardiac arrest as a technique to limit cerebral damage (see further on in Treatment of Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy section).

A normal body temperature is ordinarily maintained despite environmental variations because the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center balances the excess heat production derived from metabolic activity in muscle and the liver with heat dissipation from the skin and lungs. According to studies of healthy individuals 18–40 years of age, the mean oral temperature is 36.8° ± 0.4°C (98.2° ± 0.7°F), with low levels at 6 a.m. and higher levels at 4–6 p.m. The maximal normal oral temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F) at 6 a.m. and 37.7°C (99.9°F) at 4 p.m.; these

A fever of >41.5°C (>106.7°F) is called hyperpyrexia. This extraordinarily high fever can develop in patients with severe infections but most commonly occurs in patients with central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhages. In the preantibiotic era, fever due to a variety of infectious diseases rarely exceeded 106°F, and there has been speculation that this natural “thermal ceiling” is mediated by neuropeptides functioning as central antipyretics.

In rare cases, the hypothalamic set point is elevated as a result of local trauma, hemorrhage, tumor, or intrinsic hypothalamic malfunction. The term hypothalamic fever is sometimes used to describe elevated temperature caused by abnormal hypothalamic function. However, most patients with hypothalamic damage have subnormal, not supra-normal, body temperatures.

PART 2 Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases

Although most patients with elevated body temperature have fever, there are circumstances in which elevated temperature represents not fever but hyperthermia (heat stroke). Hyperthermia is characterized by an uncontrolled increase in body temperature that exceeds the body’s ability to lose heat. The setting of the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center is unchanged. In contrast to fever in infections, hyperthermia does not involve pyrogenic molecules. Exogenous heat exposure and endogenous heat production are two mechanisms by which hyperthermia can result in dangerously high internal temperatures. Excessive heat production can easily cause hyperthermia despite physiologic and behavioral control of body temperature. For example, work or exercise in hot environments can produce heat faster than peripheral mechanisms can lose it. For a detailed discussion of hyperthermia, see Chap. 479e.

Influenza is most frequently described as a respiratory illness characterized by systemic symptoms, such as headache, feverishness, chills, myalgia, and malaise, as well as accompanying respiratory tract signs and symptoms, particularly cough and sore throat. In some cases, the onset is so abrupt that patients can recall the precise time they became ill. However, the spectrum of clinical presentations is wide, ranging from a mild, afebrile respiratory illness similar to the common cold (with either a gradual or an abrupt onset) to severe prostration with relatively few respiratory signs and symptoms.

Hydramnios-also calledpoyhydramniosdefines a volume above a given normal threshold. Amnionic luid volume is usually assessed semiquantitatively. Measurements include either the single deepest vertical luid pocket or the sum of the deepest vertical pockets from each of four equal uterine quadrants-the amnionic luid index (Phelan, 1987). Reference ranges have been established for both measurements from 16 weeks' gestation onward. he single deepest vertical pocket is normally between 2 and 8 cm, and the amnionic luid index normally ranges between 8 and 24 cm.

Other causes of voiding difficulty include medications (such as antihistamines and anticholinergic agents), infections (in particular, herpes simplex virus, and urinary tract infections), obstruction (following bladder neck surgery, or in women with advanced pelvic organ prolapse), overdistension, severe constipation (particularly in the elderly), and, rarely, psychogenic factors. Fowler’s syndrome refers to unexplained urinary retention occurring as an isolated phenomenon (144). Such women usually are between 20 and 35 years of age. Commonly the first retention episode will be triggered by an event such as surgery or childbirth. Retention rarely resolves but is not associated with the development of other disorders.

Evaluation Evaluation of a woman with voiding difficulty begins with a careful physical examination. Advanced pelvic organ prolapse may contribute to urinary retention, but it is unlikely that prolapse above the level of the vaginal introitus will be the sole cause of retention. When in doubt, the woman can wear a pessary for a week to see whether elevating the prolapse reduces the voiding difficulty. Occasionally pelvic masses—in particular, low anterior myomas—may cause urinary retention. Abnormal findings detected during neurologic examination of the perineum and lower extremities may suggest the need to focus on the spine. Urodynamic evaluation will help determine whether the woman has an obstruction (manifested by high detrusor pressures during voiding or by no urethral relaxation during voiding) or whether the detrusor muscle is not contracting. The latter is not necessarily indicative of a neurogenic disorder in women, because a large minority of normal healthy women void by urethral and pelvic ﬂoor muscle relaxation alone, with no detrusor contraction. Cystourethroscopy may reveal an obstructing lesion, such as a polyp, tumor, ureterocele, or ball-valve stone. Usually, the evaluation reveals no obvious source, and treatment can commence.

Sooner or later, focal cerebral signs will be discovered in most patients with brain tumors. Most often the focal signs are at first slight and subtle, but some patients present with such signs. In the modern era of ubiquitous imaging for all manner of cerebral complaints, CT or MRI often will have disclosed the presence of a tumor before either focal cerebral signs or the signs of increased intracranial pressure have become evident.

The cerebral tumors that are most likely to produce the syndromes of asthenia, headache, seizures, or focal signs are the ones discussed below.

20 percent of all intracranial tumors, benign and malignant, and for more than 80 percent of gliomas of the cerebral hemispheres in adults. Although predominantly cerebral in location, they may also arise in the brainstem, cerebellum, or spinal cord. The peak incidence is in middle adult life (mean age for the occurrence of glioblastoma is approximately 60 years, and 46 years for anaplastic astrocytoma), but no age group is exempt. The incidence is higher in men (ratio of approximately 1.6:1). Almost all of the high-grade gliomas occur sporadically, without a familial predilection.

The glioblastoma, known since the time of Virchow, was definitively recognized as a glioma by Bailey and Cushing and given a place in their histogenetic classification. They are now listed as grade IV glial tumors in the WHO classification and divided as to the IDH genotype. Most arise in the deep white matter as a heterogenous mass and quickly infiltrate the brain extensively, sometimes attaining enormous size before attracting medical attention.

Genetics of gliomas Among the first detectable changes in glioblastoma are mutations acquired in the act of neoplastic cell division that inactivate the tumor suppressor gene p53 on chromosome 17p; over 50 percent of astrocytomas have deletions within this gene. Other early changes include overexpression of genes that control growth factors or their receptors as noted below. After the tumor develops, progression to a more malignant grade of astrocytoma or to a glioblastoma may be triggered by defects causing overexpression of the epidermal growth factor gene. In fact, it is striking that analysis of the patterns of these defects in some tumors correlates with the staging and aggressive characteristics of these tumors. The events that lead to their accumulation are not clear, as noted below. Also, mutations in the genes that code for isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1 and 2) are common in gliomas and oligodendrogliomas and their presence relates to slower tumor progression.

Furthermore, mutations in the paired 1p/19q region, EGFR, ATRX, TERT promoter and a number of other subsidiary genes influence the behavior of gliomas, treatment response (see below), and have greatly altered modern classification as already noted. As noted below, epigenetic characteristics, especially of MGMT methylation, are also involved in the response to antitumor agents, specifically temozolomide. A systematic approach to understanding these mutations is shown in Fig. 30-3. In the modern conceptualization, there is a hierarchy of mutations that determine tumor behavior.

Diagnosis It is prudent to biopsy lesions that are considered on clinical and imaging grounds to be glioblastoma. The tissue serves not only to provide potential information regarding prognosis and to some extent, to guide treatment but the main reason for obtaining tissue is to exclude the possibility of another neoplastic or nonneoplastic diagnosis such as lymphoma, brain abscess or other infection (see Chap. 31), tumefactive multiple sclerosis (see Chap. 35), infarction, encephalitis, and others.

performed only for patients likely to have metastasis based on the characteristics of the primary tumor; for example, a staging work-up for a patient with ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast or a small invasive breast tumor is likely to be low yield and not cost effective.Recently there also is increased usage of molecular imag-ing with positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, or PET/CT, for cancer staging. Most commonly PET scanning is performed with fluorine 18 incorporated into fluorodeoxy-glucose (FDG). FDG PET assesses the rate of glycolysis. FDG uptake is increased in most

Thus, genetic counseling and testing with a multigene panel should be considered for such patients.78PTEN and Cowden DiseaseSomatic deletions or mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) have been observed in a number of glioma breast, prostate, and renal carcinoma cell lines and several primary tumor

Confirmation that a sudden collapse with loss of consciousness (LOC) is due to a cardiac arrest includes prompt observations of the state of consciousness, respiratory movements, skin color, and the presence or absence of pulses in the carotid or femoral arteries. For lay responders, the pulse check is no longer recommended because it is unreliable. As soon as a cardiac arrest is suspected, confirmed, or even considered to be impending, calling an emergency rescue system (e.g., 911) is the immediate priority. With the development of AEDs that are easily used by nonconventional emergency responders, an additional layer for response has evolved (see below).

Careful attention to the respiratory status after abrupt LOC is important. Although normal breathing or tachypnea after LOC makes cardiac arrest less likely, gasping respiratory movements may persist during a true cardiac arrest, and their presence should not deter appropriate responses. In fact, continued gasping is considered a good prognostic sign for successful outcome. It is also important to observe for severe stridor with a persistent pulse as a clue to aspiration of a foreign body or food. If this is suspected, a Heimlich maneuver (see below) may dislodge the obstructing body. A precordial blow, or “thump,” delivered firmly with a clenched fist to the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the sternum may occasionally revert VT or VF, but there is concern about converting VT to VF. Therefore, it is recommended to use precordial thumps as a life support technique only when monitoring and defibrillation are available. This conservative application of the technique remains controversial.

The third action during the initial response is to clear the airway. The head is tilted back and the chin lifted so that the oropharynx can be explored to clear the airway. Dentures or foreign bodies are removed, and the Heimlich maneuver is performed if there is reason to suspect that a foreign body is lodged in the oropharynx. If respiratory arrest precipitating cardiac arrest is suspected, a second precordial thump is delivered after the airway is cleared.

If open pneumothorax is identified, an occlusive dressing must be applied immediately. This must be secured on three sides only to prevent the development of tension pneumothorax.

Massive hemothorax is diagnosed through chest tube placement and is defined as > 1000 cc of immediate blood return or > 200/hour for > 2–4 hours. The treatment for massive hemothorax is volume resuscitation followed by surgery to repair the site of bleeding. The treatment for ﬂail chest is supportive, followed by surgical fixation of the chest wall.

Circulation:

Apply direct pressure to any actively bleeding wounds.

Place a 16-gauge IV in each antecubital fossa.

Isotonic ﬂuids (LR or NS) are repleted in a 3:1 ratio (ﬂuid to blood loss). Start with a ﬂuid bolus of 1–2 L in adults; then recheck vitals and continue repletion as indicated.

If the patient remains tachycardic or hypotensive after the first 2 L of isotonic ﬂuid, transfusion with packed RBCs may be indicated.

To remember the Glasgow Coma Scale, think 4-eyes, Jackson-5, V6 engine. Four points can be assigned for eye response, five points for verbal response, and six points for motor response.

Patients with chest trauma and shock may have cardiac tamponade. The relevant signs are JVD, hypotension, and mufﬂed heart sounds. This can be diagnosed with bedside ultrasound. If tamponade is diagnosed, an immediate pericardiocentesis is necessary.

Disability/Exposure:

Disability (CNS dysfunction) is assessed and quantified with the GCS.

Exposure requires that the patient be completely disrobed and assessed for injury and temperature status on both the front and back of the body. Hypothermia is a common problem in trauma and can worsen bleeding; once the exam is done, the patient should be covered with warm blankets.

Once the patient is stable, conduct a full examination.

This is particularly true for penetrating injuries of the neck, thoracic outlet, and groin, where bleeding may be torrential and aris-ing deep within the wound. In these situations, a gloved finger placed through the wound directly onto the bleeding vessel can apply enough pressure to control active bleeding. The surgeon performing this maneuver must then walk with the patient to the OR for definitive treatment. For bleeding of the extremi-ties, it is tempting to apply tourniquets for hemorrhage control, Figure 7-7. Saphenous vein cutdowns are excellent sites for fluid resuscitation access. A.

PET are rou-tine in the evaluation of patients with lung cancer. Integrated PET-CT scanners have become standard and have substan-tially improved accuracy of detection and localization of lymph node and distant metastases, as compared with independently performed PET and CT scans (Fig. 19-21). This technology overcomes the imprecise information on the exact location of focal abnormalities seen on PET and has become the standard imaging modality for lung cancer. Compared to routine chest or abdominal CT and bone scans, PET scanning detects 10% to 15% more distant metastases, but should be confirmed with MRI and/or

injection of radiolabeled deoxyglucose, which is taken up in metabolically active tissues such as cancer. PET-positive areas must be correlated with the CT scan findings to assess the sig-nificance of “hot spots.” CTPET scanning has been especially useful before the initiation of chemoradiation therapy. An early response to chemoradiotherapy, by PET scan, improves the prognosis whether or not resection is ultimately performed. Conversely, if a PET-avid tumor shows no change in metabolic activity after 2 weeks of induction chemoradiation therapy, it is unlikely that further chemoor radiation therapy will be of invasive surgery may

radiographic imaging with CT scan, positron emission tomography (PET), or preferably CT-PET. PET scanning attempts to identify sites of malignancy based on glucose metabolism by measuring the uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Rapidly dividing cells, presumably in the lung tumors, will preferentially take up 18F-FDG and appear as a “hot spot.” To date, PET has been mostly used for staging and detection of metastases in lung cancer and in the detection of nodules >15 mm in diameter. Combined 18F-FDG PET-CT imaging has been shown to improve the accuracy of staging in NSCLC

of staging in NSCLC compared to visual correlation of PET and CT or either study alone. CT-PET has been found to be superior in identifying pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and extrathoracic metastases. A standardized uptake value (SUV) of >2.5 on PET is highly suspicious for malignancy. False negatives can be seen in diabetes, in lesions <8 mm, and in slow-growing tumors (e.g., carcinoid tumors or well-differentiated adenocarcinoma). False positives can be seen in certain infections and granulomatous disease (e.g., tuberculosis). Thus, PET should never be used alone to diagnose

For brain metastases, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most effective method. MRI can also be useful in selected circumstances, such as superior sulcus tumors to rule out brachial plexus involvement, but in general, MRI does not play a major role in NSCLC staging.

With reference to the most common of these symptoms, the neck and shoulder pain, in any sizable group of patients older than 50 years of age, approximately 40 percent will be found at times to have some clinical abnormality of the neck, usually crepitus or pain, with restriction of lateral flexion and rotation (less often of extension). Pallis and colleagues, in a survey of 50 patients, all of them older than 50 years of age and none with neurologic complaints, found that 75 percent showed radiologic evidence of narrowing of the cervical spinal canal as a result of osteophytosis of the posterior vertebral bodies or of narrowing of the intervertebral foramina because of osteoarthropathy at the apophyseal joints; thickening of the ligaments (both the ligamentum flavum posteriorly and the posterior longitudinal ligament anteriorly) adds to the narrowing of the canal. However, only half of the patients with radiologic abnormalities showed physical signs of root or cord involvement such as changes in the tendon reflexes in the arms, briskness of reflexes and impairment of vibratory sense in the legs, and sometimes Babinski signs. The occasional finding of a Babinski sign in older individuals who had never had a stroke or complained of neurologic symptoms is often explained by an otherwise inevident cervical osteophyte (Savitsky and Madonick).

The pain is usually centered at the base of the neck or higher, often radiating to an area above the scapula. When brachialgia is also present, it takes several forms: a sharp pain in the preor postaxial border of the limb, extending to the elbow, wrist, or fingers; or a persistent dull ache in the forearm or wrist, sometimes with a burning sensation. Discomfort may be elicited by coughing, Valsalva maneuver, or neck extension, or neck flexion may induce electrical feelings down the spine (Lhermitte symptom). Rarely, the pain is referred substernally.

FIGURE 157-1 Acute septic arthritis of the sternoclavicular joint.

A man in his forties with a history of cirrhosis presented with a new onset of fever and lower neck pain. He had no history of IV drug use or previous catheter placement. Jaundice and a painful swollen area over his left sternoclavicular joint were evident on physical examination. Cultures of blood drawn at admission grew group B Streptococcus. The patient recovered after treatment with IV penicillin. (Courtesy of Francisco M. Marty, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston; with permission.) common among patients with rheumatoid arthritis and may resemble a flare of the underlying disease.

The usual presentation consists of moderate to severe pain that is uniform around the joint, effusion, muscle spasm, and decreased range of motion. Fever in the range of 38.3–38.9°C (101–102°F) and sometimes higher is common but may not be present, especially in persons with rheumatoid arthritis, renal or hepatic insufficiency, or conditions requiring immunosuppressive therapy. The inflamed, swollen joint is usually evident on examination except in the case of a deeply situated joint such as the hip, shoulder, or sacroiliac joint. Cellulitis, bursitis, and acute osteomyelitis, which may produce a similar clinical picture, should be distinguished from septic arthritis by their greater range of motion and less-than-circumferential swelling. A focus of extraarticular infection, such as a boil or pneumonia, should be sought. Peripheral-blood leukocytosis with a left shift and elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein level are common.

Plain radiographs show evidence of soft-tissue swelling, joint-space widening, and displacement of tissue planes by the distended capsule. Narrowing of the joint space and bony erosions indicate advanced infection and a poor prognosis. Ultrasound is useful for detecting effusions in the hip, and CT or MRI can demonstrate infections of the sacroiliac joint, the sternoclavicular joint, and the spine very well.

CTS consist of numbness and paresthesias variably in the thumb, index, middle, and half of the ring finger. At times, the paresthesias can include the entire hand and extend into the forearm or upper arm or can be isolated to one or two fingers. Pain is another common symptom and can be located in the hand and forearm and, at times, in the proximal arm. CTS is common and often misdiagnosed as thoracic outlet syndrome. The signs of CTS are decreased sensation in the median nerve distribution; reproduction of the sensation of tingling when a percussion hammer is tapped over the wrist (Tinel’s sign) or the wrist is flexed for 30–60 s (Phalen’s sign); and weakness of thumb opposition and abduction. EDx is extremely sensitive and shows slowing of sensory and, to a lesser extent, motor median potentials across the wrist. Treatment options consist of avoidance of precipitating activities; control of underlying systemic-associated conditions if present; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications; neutral (volar) position wrist splints, especially for night use; glucocorticoid/anesthetic injection into the carpal tunnel; and surgical decompression by dividing the transverse carpal ligament. The surgical option should be considered if there is a poor response to nonsurgical treatments; if there is thenar muscle atrophy and/or weakness; and if there are significant denervation potentials on EMG.

Other proximal median neuropathies are very uncommon and include the pronator teres syndrome and anterior interosseous neuropathy. These often occur as a partial form of brachial plexitis.

are several caveats to be considered when evaluat-ing the injured patient for shock. Tachycardia (HR >110 bpm) is often the earliest sign of ongoing blood loss, but the critical issue is change in HR over time. Individuals in good physical condition with a resting pulse rate in the 50s may manifest a relative tachycardia in the 90s; although clinically significant, this does not meet the standard definition of tachycardia. Con-versely, patients on cardiac medications such as β-blockers may not be capable of increasing their heart rate to compensate for hypovolemia. Bradycardia can occur with

the cause of the hypotension is pursued. Shock in a trauma patient or postoperative patient should be presumed to be due to hemorrhage until proven otherwise. The clinical signs of shock may be evidenced by agitation, cool clammy extremities, tachy-cardia, weak or absent peripheral pulses, and hypotension. Such apparent clinical shock results from at least 25% to 30% loss of the blood volume. However, substantial volumes of blood may be lost before the classic clinical manifestations of shock are evident.

the patient’s cardiovascular status can be obtained by palpating peripheral pulses.

Any episode of hypotension (defined as a SBP <90 mmHg) is assumed to be caused by hem-orrhage until proven otherwise.

In association with severe pelvic fractures, urethral rupture may occur at the prostatomembranous junction above the deep perineal pouch. The urine will extravasate into the true pelvis.

The worst and most serious urethral rupture is related to serious pelvic injuries where there is complete disruption of the puboprostatic ligaments. The prostate is dislocated superiorly not only by the ligamentous disruption but also by the extensive hematoma formed within the true pelvis. The diagnosis can be made by palpating the elevated prostate during a digital rectal examination.

A 25-year-old man visited his family physician because he had a “dragging feeling” in the left side of his scrotum. He was otherwise healthy and had no other symptoms. During examination, the physician palpated the left testis, which was normal, although he noted soft nodular swelling around the superior aspect of the testes and the epididymis. In his clinical notes, he described these findings as a “bag of worms” (Fig. 5.86). The bag of worms was a varicocele.

The venous drainage of the testis is via the pampiniform plexus of veins that runs within the spermatic cord. A varicocele is a collection of dilated veins that arise from the pampiniform plexus. In many ways, they are similar to varicose veins that develop in the legs. Typically, the patient complains of a dragging feeling in the scrotum and around the testis, which is usually worse toward the end of the day.

The family physician recommended surgical treatment, with a recommendation for surgery through an inguinal incision.

A simple surgical technique divides the skin around the inguinal ligament. The aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle is divided in the anterior abdominal wall to display the spermatic cord. Careful inspection of the spermatic cord reveals the veins, which are surgically ligated.

Another option is to embolize the varicocele.

Ultrasound.

Typically none unless hernia is present or hydrocele persists beyond 12–18 months of age (indicates patent processus vaginalis, which leads to an ↑ risk for inguinal hernia).

If symptomatic or if testis makes up < 40% of total volume, may be treated surgically with a varicocelectomy or ligation, or through embolization via interventional radiology.

T AB LE 2.1 6-9. Differential Diagnosis of Scrotal Swelling (continued )

Infection of the epididymis, usually from STIs, prostatitis, and/or ref ux.

Twisting of the spermatic cord, leading to ischemia and possible testicular infarction.

Typically affects those > 30 years of age; presents with epididymal tenderness, tender/ enlarged testicle(s), fever, scrotal thickening, erythema, and pyuria.

Pain may ↓ with scrotal elevation ( Prehn’s sign).

Typically affects those < 30 years of age; presents with intense, acute-onset scrotal pain that remains the same or ↑ with scrotal elevation ( Prehn’s sign).

Pain is often accompanied by nausea/vomiting and/or dizziness.

Loss of cremasteric refex is also seen.

UA, culture (pyuria). Culture often shows Neisseria gonorrhoeae, E. coli, or Chlamydia.

Doppler ultrasound shows normal to ↑blood fow to testes.

Doppler ultrasound shows ↓blood f ow to testes.

(If there is a high clinical suspicion for testicular torsion, do not wait for ultrasound and proceed immediately to surgery!)

Antibiotics (tetracycline, f uoroquinolones); NSAIDs; scrotal support for pain.

Attempt manual detorsion.

Immediate surgery to salvage testis (the testicle is often unsalvageable after six hours of ischemia).

Orchiopexy of both testes to prevent future torsion.

I. CRYPTORCHIDISM

A. Failure of testicle to descend into the scrotal sac 1. Testicles normally develop in the abdomen and then "descend" into the scrotal sac as the fetus grows.

B. Most common congenital male reproductive abnormality; seen in 1% of male infants pathoma.com

C. Most cases resolve spontaneously; otherwise, orchiopexy is performed before 2 years of age.

D. Complications include testicular atrophy with infertility and increased risk for seminoma.

II. ORCHITIS

A. Inflammation of the testicle

B. Causes 1.

Chlamydia trachomatis (serotypes D-K) or Neisseria gonorrhoeae-Seen in young adults. Increased risk of sterility, but libido is not affected because Leydig cells are spared.

2.

Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas-Seen in older adults; urinary tract infection pathogens spread into the reproductive tract.

3.

Mumps virus (teenage males)-increased risk for infertility; testicular inflammation is usually not seen in children < 10 years old.

4.

Autoimmune orchitis-characterized by granulomas involving the seminiferous tubules

III. TESTICULAR TORSION

A. Twisting of the spermatic cord; thin-walled veins become obstructed leading to congestion and hemorrhagic infarction (Fig. 14.2).

B. Usually due to congenital failure of testes to attach to the inner lining of the scrotum (via the processus vaginalis)

C. Presents in adolescents with sudden testicular pain and absent cremasteric reflex

IV.

A. Dilation of the spermatic vein due to impaired drainage

B. Presents as scrotal swelling with a "bag of worms" appearance

C. Usually left sided; left testicular vein drains into the left renal vein, while the right testicular vein drains directly into the IVC.

Testicular torsion Rotation of testicle around spermatic cord and vascular pedicle. Commonly presents in males 12–18 years old. May occur after an inciting event (eg, trauma) or spontaneously. Characterized by acute, severe pain, high-riding testis, and absent cremasteric reflex. Treatment: surgical correction (orchiopexy) within 6 hours, manual detorsion if surgical option unavailable in timeframe. If testis is not viable, orchiectomy. Orchiopexy, when performed, should be bilateral because the contralateral testis is at risk for subsequent torsion.

Varicocele Dilated veins in pampiniform plexus due to  venous pressure; most common cause of scrotal enlargement in adult males; most often on left side because of  resistance to flow from left gonadal vein drainage into left renal vein; can cause infertility because of • temperature; diagnosed by standing clinical exam/Valsalva maneuver (distension on inspection and “bag of worms” on palpation; augmented by Valsalva) or ultrasound A ; does not transilluminate. Treatment: consider surgical ligation or embolization if associated with pain or infertility.

Extragonadal germ cell Arise in midline locations. In adults, most commonly in retroperitoneum, mediastinum, pineal, and tumors suprasellar regions. In infants and young children, sacrococcygeal teratomas are most common.

Scrotal masses Benign scrotal lesions present as testicular masses that can be transilluminated (vs solid testicular tumors).

Congenital hydrocele Common cause of scrotal swelling A in infants, Transilluminating swelling. due to incomplete obliteration of processus vaginalis. Most spontaneously resolve within 1 year.

Germ cell tumors account for ∼ 95% of all testicular tumors. Arise from germ cells that produce sperm. Most often occur in young men. Risk factors: cryptorchidism, Klinefelter syndrome. Can present as a mixed germ cell tumor. Do not transilluminate. Usually not biopsied (risk of seeding scrotum), removed via radical orchiectomy.

Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is seen in approximately 1 to 2 per 1000 live births and is an immune process in which antibodies are directed against platelets. Platelet-associated IgG antibodies can cross the placenta and cause thrombocytopenia in the fetus and newborn. The severely thrombocytopenic fetus is at increased risk for intracranial hemorrhage. ITP during pregnancy requires close maternal and fetal management to reduce the risks of life-threatening maternal hemorrhage and trauma to the fetus at delivery. Postnatal management involves observation of the infant’s platelet count. For infants who have evidence of hemorrhage, sin-gle-donor irradiated platelets may be administered to control the bleeding. The infant may benefit from an infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin. Neonatal thrombocytopenia usually resolves within 4 to 6 weeks.

Immune abnormalities in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)can lead to the production of anti-Ro (SS-A) and anti-La (SS-B)antibodies that can cross the placenta and injure fetal tissue.The most serious complication is damage to the cardiac conducting system, which results in congenital heart block. The heart block observed in association with maternal SLE tends to be complete (third degree), although less advanced blocks havebeen observed. The mortality rate is approximately 20%; mostsurviving infants require pacing. Neonatal lupus may occur and is characterized by skin lesions (sharply demarcated erythematous plaques or central atrophic macules with peripheralscaling with predilection for the eyes, face, and scalp), thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolysis, and hepatic involvement.

Polycythemic patients appear plethoric or ruddy and may develop acrocyanosis. Symptoms are a result of the increased RBC mass and of vascular compromise. Seizures, lethargy, and irritability reflect abnormalities of microcirculation of the brain, whereas hyperbilirubinemia may reflect the poor hepatic circulation or the increased amount of hemoglobin that is being broken down into bilirubin. Additional problems include respiratory distress and primary pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) that result in part from elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. The chest radiograph often reveals cardiomegaly, increased vascular markings, pleural effusions, and interstitial edema. Other problems are NEC, hypoglycemia, thrombocytopenia, priapism, testicular infarction, hemiplegic stroke, and feeding intolerance. Many of these complications also are related to the primary condition associated with polycythemia (small for gestational age infants are at risk for hypoglycemia and PPHN after periods of hypoxia in utero).

Long-term sequelae of neonatal polycythemia relate to neurodevelopmental abnormalities that may be prevented by treatment of symptomatic infants with partial exchange transfusion after birth. A partial exchange transfusion removes whole blood and replaces it with normal saline. The equation used to calculate the volume exchanged is based on the central venous hematocrit because peripheral hematocrits may be falsely elevated:

Volume to exchange(mL) = [blood volume× (observed hematocrit −desired hematocrit)]/observed hematocrit

The desired hematocrit is 50%, and the blood volume 85 mL/kg.

LABORATORY STUDIES Blood Anemia is present in most cases, either alone or as part of bi-or pancytopenia; isolated neutropenia or thrombocytopenia is more unusual. Macrocytosis is common, and the smear may be dimorphic with a distinctive population of large red blood cells. Platelets are also large and lack granules. In functional studies, they may show marked abnormalities, and patients may have bleeding symptoms despite seemingly adequate numbers. Neutrophils are hypogranulated; have hyposegmented, ringed, or abnormally segmented nuclei; contain Döhle bodies; and may be functionally deficient. Circulating myeloblasts usually correlate with marrow blast numbers, and their quantity is important for classification and prognosis. The total white blood cell count (WBC) is usually normal or low, except in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. As in aplastic anemia, MDS can be associated with a clonal population of PNH cells. Genetic testing is commercially available for constitutional syndromes.

Bone Marrow The bone marrow is usually normal or hypercellular, but in about 20% of cases, it is sufficiently hypocellular to be confused with aplasia. No single characteristic feature of marrow morphology distinguishes MDS, but the following are commonly observed: dyserythropoietic changes (especially nuclear abnormalities) and ringed sideroblasts in the erythroid lineage; hypogranulation and hyposegmentation in granulocytic precursors, with an increase in myeloblasts; and megakaryocytes showing reduced numbers of or disorganized aGood, normal, –Y, del(5q), del (20q); poor, complex (≥3 abnormalities) or chromosome 7 abnormalities; intermediate, all other abnormalities. bCytopenias defined as hemoglobin <100 g/L, platelet count <100,000/μL, and absolute neutrophil count <1500/μL.

Anemia from blood loss at birth is manifested by two patterns of presentation, depending on the rapidity of blood loss.Acute blood loss after fetal-maternal hemorrhage, rupture ofthe umbilical cord, placenta previa, or internal hemorrhage (hepatic or splenic hematoma; retroperitoneal) is characterized by pallor, diminished peripheral pulses, and shock. Thereare no signs of extramedullary hematopoiesis and no hepatosplenomegaly. The hemoglobin content and serum iron levelsinitially are normal, but the hemoglobin levels decline duringthe subsequent 24 hours. Newborns with chronic blood loss caused by chronic fetal-maternal hemorrhage or a twin-totwin transfusion present with marked pallor, heart failure,hepatosplenomegaly with or without hydrops, a low hemoglobin level at birth, a hypochromic microcytic blood smear, anddecreased serum iron stores. Fetal-maternal bleeding occurs in50% to 75% of all pregnancies, with fetal blood losses rangingfrom 1 to 50 mL; most blood losses are 1 mL or less, 1 in 400 are approximately 30 mL, and 1 in 2000 are approximately 100 mL.

The diagnosis of fetal-maternal hemorrhage is confirmed by the Kleihauer-Betke acid elution test. Pink fetal RBCs are observed and counted in the mother’s peripheral blood smear because fetal hemoglobin is resistant to acid elution; adult hemoglobin is eluted, leaving discolored maternal cells (patients with sickle cell anemia or hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin may have a false-positive result, and ABO incompatibility may produce a false-negative result).

The diagnosis of a UTI is confirmed by a positive urine culture, but this does not distinguish between upper tract andlower tract infection. Localization of a UTI is importantbecause upper UTI is associated more frequently with bacteremia and with anatomic abnormalities than is uncomplicated cystitis. The clinical manifestations of UTI do notreliably distinguish the site of infection in neonates, infants,and toddlers. Fever and abdominal pain may occur with either lower or upper UTI, although high fever, costovertebral tenderness, high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, leukocytosis, and bacteremia each suggest upper tract involvement.DMSA scan is sensitive for detecting acute pyelonephritisbut not commonly used.

The manifestations of UTI overlap with signs of sepsis seen in young children and with enteritis, appendicitis, mesenteric lymphadenitis, and pneumonia in older children. Dysuria may indicate pinworm infection, hypersensitivity to soaps or detergents, vaginitis, or sexual abuse and infection.

Empirical therapy should be initiated for symptomatic children and for all children with a urine culture confirming UTI. For an older child who does not appear ill but has a positive urine culture, oral antibiotic therapy should be initiated. For a child with suspected UTI who appears toxic, appears dehydrated, or is unable to retain oral fluids, initial antibiotic therapy should be administered parenterally, and hospitalization should be considered.

or other evidence of anatomic abnormality. A VCUG may also be performed if a child has recurrent infections despite empirical treatment. These guidelines do not address children older than 2 years of age but one can assume that simi-lar algorithms of treatment would be appropriate.There is now greater understanding that most children with UTIs, whether pyelonephritis or cystitis, have some ele-ment of bladder and/or bowel dysfunction as the major factor in the development of the infection. Thus, all children with UTIs need to have a thorough assessment of daily bladder and bowel habits. The latter may

Voiding difficulties are frequent in preschool age children due todelay in maturation of bladder and micturition pathways. Normal micturition and continence rely on structural UT integrity,neurologic maturation, and coordination between somatic andautonomic nervous system units, including the central nervoussystem, spinal cord pathways, nerves innervating the bladder/urinary sphincter, and the autonomic system. Daytime continence is usually achieved before nighttime continence. Mostchildren are dry, day and night, by 4 to 5 years of age. Nocturnalenuresis is the involuntary loss of urine during sleep. Childrenwith primary enuresis have never had a prolonged (usually >3months) span of nighttime continence. Up to 10% of 5-year-oldchildren have primary enuresis with 15% spontaneous resolution per year. Boys are affected more than girls with increasedincidence in families (40% at 6 years of age if one affected parent, 70% if two affected parents). Secondary enuresis involvesloss of nighttime control after an extended period of drynessand generally requires evaluation to uncover the cause.

Decision-Making Algorithm Available @ StudentConsult.com Clinical Manifestations

Dysfunctional voiding (DV) may manifest as incontinence, fre- quency, urgency, hesitancy, dysuria, lower abdominal pain, or recurrent UTI. Symptoms may vary over time and be associatedwith obvious neurologic problems (spinal cord injury, encephalitis), constipation, and/or behavioral problems. DV symptomsmay vary, depending on recent UTI or changes in family orschool life/stressors. The majority of children with DV are anatomically, neurologically, and psychologically normal.

Evaluation for DV may be performed at any age, but isolatedurinary incontinence in an otherwise normal child is notusually evaluated until 5 years of age. A urinalysis and urineculture should be done to exclude occult infection and renal disease. Children with daytime incontinence should undergorenal/bladder ultrasound to exclude structural abnormalities. Urodynamic evaluation is typically reserved for childrenwith a suspicion of neurogenic bladder or known neurologicetiology.

In situations with combined sodium and water deficits, analysis of the urine differentiates renal and nonrenal etiologies. When the losses are extrarenal, the kidney responds to volume depletion with low urine volume, a concentrated urine, and sodium retention (urine sodium <10 mEq/L). With renal causes, the urine volume is usually high, the urine is not maximally concentrated, and the urine sodium may be inappropriately elevated.

Figure 35-2 Differential diagnosis of hypernatremia by mechanism. GI, Gastrointestinal; NG, nasogastric.

Most children with hypernatremia are dehydrated and have the typical signs and symptoms of dehydration (see Chapter 33). Children with hypernatremic dehydration tend to have better preservation of intravascular volume owing to the shiftof water from the intracellular space to the extracellular space. Hypernatremic infants potentially become more dehydrated before seeking medical attention. Probably because of intracellular water loss, the pinched abdominal skin of a dehydrated, hypernatremic infant has a doughy feel.

Hypernatremia, even without dehydration, causes central nervous system symptoms that tend to parallel the degree of sodium elevation and the acuity of the increase. Patients are irritable, restless, weak, and lethargic. Some infants have a high-pitched cry and hyperpnea. Alert patients are very thirsty, although nausea may be present. Hypernatremia causes fever, although many patients have an underlying process that contributes to the fever.

Head circumference: Measured routinely in the first two years. ↑ head circumference can indicate hydrocephalus or tumor; ↓ head circumference can point to microcephaly (e.g., TORCH infections).

Height and weight: Measured routinely until adulthood. The pattern of growth is more important than the raw numbers. Infants may lose 5–10% of birth weight (BW) over the first few days but should return to their BW by 14 days. Infants can be expected to double their BW by 4–5 months, triple by one year, and quadruple by two years.

Failure to thrive: Persistent weight less than the 5th percentile for age or “falling off the growth curve” (i.e., crossing two major percentile lines on a growth chart). Classified as follows:

Organic: Due to an underlying medical condition such as cystic fibro-sis, congenital heart disease, celiac sprue, pyloric stenosis, chronic infection (e.g., HIV), and GERD.

Nonorganic: Primarily due to psychosocial factors such as maternal depression, neglect, or abuse.

A careful dietary history and close observation of maternal-infant interactions (especially preparation of formula and feeding) are critical to diagnosis.

Children should be hospitalized if there is evidence of neglect or severe malnourishment. Calorie counts and supplemental nutrition (if breastfeeding is inadequate) are mainstays of treatment.

Tanner staging: Performed to assess physical development in boys and girls. Stage 1 is preadolescent; stage 5 is adult. Increasing stages are assigned for testicular and penile growth in boys and breast growth in girls; pubic hair development is used for both stages.

Girls: The average age of puberty is 10.5 years. Generally the order of progression is thelarche (breast bud development) → pubarche (pubic hair development) → growth spurt → menarche (first menstrual bleeding). The average age of menarche in United States girls is 12.5 years.

document (1) 

Isolated premature menarche is vaginal bleeding at age 1 to 9 years in the absence of other signs of puberty. The bleeding is usually limited to a few days. It can recur for 1 to 6 years and then cease. The etiology is uncertain. Most cases are associated with subsequent normal pubertal development and fertility. The differential diagnosis includes vaginal foreign bodies, trauma, sexual abuse, vaginal infection, or neoplasms such as rhabdomyosarcoma, McCune-Albright syndrome (in which menarche may occur before other manifestations of sexual precocity), and primary hypothyroidism.

In central precocious puberty, GnRH prematurely stimulates increased gonadotropin secretion. Central precocious puberty may occur in children in whom there is no structural abnormality, in which case it is termed constitutional or idiopathic. Constitutional (idiopathic) sexual precocity is the most common cause of precocious puberty. It is often familial and represents the so-called tail of the Gaussian curve (i.e., the early 2.5% for the age distribution for the onset of puberty). In many of these girls, puberty is slowly progressive, but in a few, development progresses rapidly. The major complication of sexual precocity is limitation of height. Thus, therapy may be warranted to prevent this consequence.

Figure 29.17 Five-year-old girl with development of pubic hair (A) as shown more closely in (B) (precocious adrenarche). Gonadotropin levels were prepubertal, and bone age was appropriate for age. No further development occurred until breast budding at approximately age 9.

Luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels were consistent with her development. A large neoplasm that proved to be a hypothalamic hamartoma was present on computed tomography scan. Pubertal development began at about 5 years of age.

With regard to breast development (Fig. 29.3), Tanner stage 1 refers to the prepubertal state and includes no palpable breast tissue, with the areolae generally less than 2 cm in diameter. The nipples may be inverted, ﬂat, or raised. In Tanner stage 2, breast budding occurs, with a visible and palpable mound of breast tissue. The areolae begin to enlarge, the skin of the areolae thins, and the nipple develops to varying degrees. Tanner stage 3 is reﬂected by further growth and elevation of the entire breast. When the individual is seated and viewed from the side, the nipple is generally at or above the midplane of breast tissue. In most girls, Tanner stage 4 is defined by projection of the areola and papilla above the general breast contour in a secondary mound. Breast development is incomplete until Tanner stage 5, in which the breast is mature in contour and proportion. In most women, the nipple is more pigmented at this stage than earlier in

Figure 29.1 Normal twins at 12 years of age. The heavier twin (weighing 143 lb) is clearly more advanced in puberty than the lighter twin (weighing 87 lb). Anecdotal photographs and data such as these served to provide the basis for the theory that body fat, body mass, and menarche are linked. (From Wilkins L. The diagnosis and treatment of endocrine disorders in childhood and adolescence. 3rd ed. Springfield, IL: Charles C Thomas, 1965, with permission.) development, and Montgomery’s glands are visible around the circumference of the areola. The nipple is generally below the midplane of breast tissue when the woman is seated and viewed from the side. Full breast development usually occurs over 3 to 3.5 years, but it may occur in as little as 2 years or not progress beyond stage 4 until the first pregnancy. Breast size is no indication of breast maturity.

Variability in body proportions occurs from fetal to adultlife. Newborns’ heads are significantly larger in proportion tothe rest of their body. This difference gradually disappears.Certain growth disturbances result in characteristic changesin the proportional sizes of the trunk, extremities, and head.Patterns requiring further assessment are summarized inTable 6-1.

Evaluating a child over time, coupled with a careful history and physical examination, helps determine whether the growth pattern is normal or abnormal. Parental heights may be useful when deciding whether to proceed with a further evaluation. Children, in general, follow their parents’ growth pattern, although there are many exceptions.

For a girl, midparental height is calculated as follows: −2.5 2

For a boy, midparental height is calculated as follows: +2.5 2

Actual growth depends on too many variables to makean accurate prediction from midparental height determination for every child. The growth pattern of a child with lowweight, length, and head circumference is commonly associated with familial short stature (see Chapter 173). Thesechildren are genetically normal but are smaller than most

Discrepant percentiles (e.g., weight 5th, length 5th, head circumference 50th, or other discrepancies)

Caloric insufficiency Midparental heights Thyroid hormone Growth factors, growth hormone testing Evaluation of pubertal children. A child who, by age, is preadolescent or adolescentand who starts puberty later than others may have the normal variant called constitutional short stature (see Chapter173); careful examination for abnormalities of pubertaldevelopment should be done, although most are normal. Anevaluation for primary amenorrhea should be consideredfor any female adolescent who has not reached menarche by15 years or has not done so within 3 years of thelarche. Lackof breast development by age 13 years also should be evaluated (see Chapter 174).

Unfortunately for this patient, the sole blood supply to the head of the femur was via the vessels in the retinacula fibers, which were transected at the time of the fracture. If the patient had an intertrochanteric fracture instead, the vessels of the retinacula fibers would not have been damaged and a different approach to surgical fixation could be undertaken without the need for a hemiarthroplasty.

The patient has osteoporosis.

Osteoporosis is a common condition affecting older people, but is significantly more frequent in postmenopausal women. Many fractures of the femoral neck in elderly patients occur because the strength of the bone is significantly reduced when it is osteoporotic. Other common sites for osteoporotic fractures include the distal radius and the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae.

A 28-year-old woman was seen by her family practitioner for a routine pregnancy checkup at 36 weeks’ gestational age. Neither the patient nor the family physician had any concerns about the pregnancy. However, the patient did complain of unilateral swelling of her left leg, which had gradually increased over the previous 2 days. Furthermore, the evening before her visit she developed some sharp chest pain, which was exacerbated by deep breaths.

The family physician ordered a duplex ultrasound scan of the left leg venous system.

Ultrasound scanning of the vascular tree can demonstrate flow and occlusion of arteries and veins.

The probe was placed over the left femoral vein and no flow was demonstrated. Furthermore, the vein could not be compressed, and no alteration of flow with breathing could be demonstrated. Some flow was demonstrated in the deep femoral vein and in the great saphenous vein. No flow was demonstrated throughout the length of the left femoral vein, the popliteal vein, and the tibial veins.

The technician scanned the opposite side, where excellent flow was demonstrated within the right femoral venous system. In addition, when the calf was gently massaged an augmentation to the flow was noted. It was possible to demonstrate alteration of flow with respiratory excursion and venous compression was satisfactory. A diagnosis of extensive left-sided deep vein thrombosis was made.

Certain patients are more prone to deep vein thrombosis.

The swollen legs were accounted for by caval obstruction.

The tumor grew along the renal vein and into the inferior vena cava toward the heart. Renal tumors can grow rapidly; in this case the tumor grew rapidly into the inferior vena cava, occluding it. This increased the pressure in the leg veins, resulting in swelling and pitting edema of the ankles.

The patient unfortunately died on the operating table.

In this patient’s case, a “tongue” of tumor grew into the inferior vena cava. At the time of surgery, the initial dissection mobilized the kidney on its vascular pedicle; however, a large portion of tumor became detached in the inferior vena cava. The tumor embolus passed through the right atrium and right ventricle and occluded the pulmonary artery. This could not be cleared at the time of surgery, and the patient succumbed.

A 65-year-old businessman came to the emergency department with severe lower abdominal pain that was predominantly central and left sided. He had pain radiating into the left loin, and he also noticed he was passing gas and fecal debris as he urinated.

A CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis was performed (eFig. 4.191).

The CT scan demonstrated a collection of fluid (likely a pelvic abscess) in the left iliac fossa. Associated with this collection of fluid was significant bowel wall thickening of the sigmoid colon and multiple small diverticula arising throughout the sigmoid colon. Gas was present in the bladder. An obstruction was noted in the left ureter and the left pelvicalyceal system.

The patient underwent an urgent operation.

A 62-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe interscapular pain. His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it was noted he was 6’ 9” and had undergone previous eye surgery for dislocating lenses.

On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis.

The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made.

Aortic dissection is an uncommon disorder in which a small tear occurs within the aortic wall (eFig. 3.120). The aortic wall contains three layers, an intima, a media, and an adventitia. A tear in the intima extends into the media and peels it away, forming a channel within the wall of the vessel. Usually the blood reenters the main vessel wall distal to its point of entry.

The myocardial infarction

Aortic dissection may extend retrogradely to involve the coronary sinus of the right coronary artery. Unfortunately, in this patient’s case the right coronary artery became occluded as the dissection passed into the origin. In normal individuals the right coronary artery supplies the anterior inferior aspect of the myocardium, and this is evident as an anterior myocardial infarct on an ECG.

The ischemic left leg

The two channels within the aorta have extended throughout the length of the aorta into the right iliac system and to the level of the right femoral artery. Although blood flows through these structures it often causes reduced blood flow. Hence the reduced blood flow into the left lower limb renders it ischemic.

The patient became acidotic.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION Hepatic Features Wilson’s disease may present as hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatic decompensation. Patients typically present in the midto late teenage years in Western countries, although the age of presentation is quite broad and extends into the fifth decade of life. An episode of hepatitis may occur—with elevated serum aminotransferase levels, with or without jaundice—and then spontaneously regress. Hepatitis often recurs, and most of these patients eventually develop cirrhosis. Hepatic decompensation is associated with elevated serum bilirubin, reduced serum albumin and coagulation factors, ascites, peripheral edema, and hepatic encephalopathy. In severe hepatic failure, hemolytic anemia may develop because large amounts of copper derived from hepatocellular necrosis are released into the bloodstream. The association of hemolysis and liver disease makes Wilson’s disease a likely diagnosis.

Neurologic Features The neurologic manifestations of Wilson’s dis-2519 ease typically occur in patients in their early twenties, although the age of onset extends into the sixth decade of life. MRI and CT scans reveal damage in the basal ganglia and occasionally in the pons, medulla, thalamus, cerebellum, and subcortical areas. The three main movement disorders include dystonia, incoordination, and tremor. Dysarthria and dysphagia are common. In some patients, the clinical picture closely resembles that of Parkinson’s disease. Dystonia can involve any part of the body and eventually leads to grotesque positions of the limbs, neck, and trunk. Autonomic disturbances may include orthostatic hypotension and sweating abnormalities as well as bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction. Memory loss, migraine-type headaches, and seizures may occur. Patients have difficulty focusing on tasks, but cognition usually is not grossly impaired. Sensory abnormalities and muscular weakness are not features of the disease.

Psychiatric Features Half of patients with neurologic disease have a history of behavioral disturbances with onset in the 5 years before diagnosis. The features are diverse and may include loss of emotional control (temper tantrums, crying bouts), depression, hyperactivity, or loss of sexual inhibition.

document (1) 

The onset of neurologic symptoms is usually in the second, and less often in the third, decade, but rarely beyond that time. Half of patients are symptomatic by age 15 years, but exceptional cases, including two under our care, had their first clinical manifestations as late as their midfifties. In all instances the initial event is a deposition of copper in the liver, leading to an acute or chronic hepatopathy and eventually to multilobular cirrhosis and splenomegaly (Scheinberg and Sternlieb). In childhood, the liver disorder often takes the form of attacks of jaundice, unexplained hepatosplenomegaly, or hypersplenism with thrombocytopenia and bleeding. Rarely is there clear evidence of cirrhosis alone. The hepatic abnormalities may be asymptomatic (except for elevated serum transaminases), in which case the initial clinical presentation is neurologic. In some instances, a hemolytic anemia or, less often, renal tubular acidosis may first draw attention to the disease.

The first neurologic manifestations are most often extrapyramidal with a proclivity to affect the oropharyngeal musculature. The typical presentations are tremor of a limb or of the head and generalized slowness of movement (i.e., a parkinsonian syndrome); or slowness of movement of the tongue, lips, pharynx, larynx, and jaws, resulting in dysarthria, dysphagia, and hoarseness; or there may be slowness of finger movement and occasionally choreic movements or dystonic postures of the limbs. Often the mouth is held slightly open in the early stage of the disease. Exceptionally, an abnormality of behavior (argumentativeness, impulsiveness, excessive emotionality, depression, delusions) or a gradual impairment of intellectual faculties precedes other neurologic signs by a year or more (see Starosta-Rubinstein et al).

Affect memory, orientation, judgment, and attention.

An impairment in cognitive functioning with global deficits. Level of consciousness is stable. Prevalence is highest among those > 85 years of age. The course is persistent and progressive. The most common causes are Alzheimer’s disease (50%) and multi-infarct dementia (25%). Other causes are outlined in the mnemonic DEMENTIAS.

Diagnostic criteria include memory impairment and one or more of the following:

Aphasia: Language impairment.

Apraxia: Inability to perform motor activities.

Agnosia: Inability to recognize previously known objects.

Impaired executive function (problems with planning, organizing, and abstracting) in the presence of a clear sensorium.

Personality, mood, and behavior changes are common (e.g., wandering and aggression).

A careful history and physical are critical. Serial mini-mental status exams should be performed.

Rule out treatable causes of dementia; obtain CBC, RPR, CMP, TFTs, HIV, B12/folate, ESR, UA, and a head CT or MRI.

work and indifference to criticism, irritability, and stubbornness (clearly traceable to a mild dementia). Only when Babinski signs and loss of tendon reflexes in the legs were detected was the correct diagnosis entertained for the first time. By then he had been ill for nearly 10 years. Bosch and Hart described a patient with the onset of dementia at 62 years of age and drew attention to 27 other similar cases of adult-onset metachromatic leukoencephalopathy (see also the 7 cases reported by Turpin and Baumann). Overt signs of neuropathy are usually lacking in these adult-onset

In the late encephalopathic forms of the metabolic and mitochondrial diseases, the diagnosis is usually made only after symptoms have been present for months or years, the disease having been mistaken for some other condition, particularly depression or a degenerative dementia. Even a manifest psychosis may have occurred in relation to some of these disorders, but such occurrences are admittedly rare. For example, one of our patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy, a 30-year-old man, began failing in college years and was later unsuccessful in holding a job because of carelessness and mistakes in his work and indifference to

Treatment begins with treating any diagnosed underlying organic causes of enuresis. Elimination of underlying chronic constipation is often curative. For a child whose enuresis is not associated with an identifiable disorder, all therapies must be considered in terms of cost in time, money, disruption to the family, the treatment’s known success rate, and the child’s likelihood to recover from the condition without treatment. The most commonly used treatment options are conditioning therapy and pharmacotherapy. The clinician can also assist the family in making a plan to help the child cope with this problem until it is resolved. Many children have to live with enuresis for months to years before a cure is achieved; a few children have symptoms into adulthood. A plan for handling wet garments and linens in a nonhumiliating and hygienic manner preserves the child’s self-esteem. The child should take as much responsibility as he or she is able, depending on age, development, and family culture.

The most widely used conditioning therapy for nocturnal enuresis is the enuresis alarm. Enuresis alarms have an initial success rate of 70% with a relapse rate of 10%. The alarm is worn on the wrist or clipped onto the pajama and has a probe that is placed in the underpants or pajamas in front of the urethra. The alarm sounds when the first drop of urine contacts the probe. The child is instructed to get up and finish voiding in the bathroom when the alarm sounds. After 3 to 5 months, 70% of children are dry through the night.

Initial catheterization prior to starting antibiotics. treatment with parenteral antibiotics is determined by clinical status. Parenteral antibiotics should be continued until there is clinical improvement (typically 24 to 48 hours). Specificantibiotic therapy should be guided by the local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and the results of the patient’surine cultures because of increasing problems related to antimicrobial resistance. Commonly used parenteral antibiotics include ceftriaxone or gentamicin. Oral regimens include acephalosporin, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, or trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole. Infants and children who do notshow the expected clinical response within 2 days of startingantimicrobial therapy should be re-evaluated, have anotherurine specimen obtained for culture, and undergo imagingpromptly.

The degree of toxicity, dehydration, and ability to retain oral intake of fluids should be assessed carefully. Restoring or maintaining adequate hydration, including correction of electrolyte abnormalities that are often associated with vomiting or poor oral intake, is important.

Bacteremia occurs in 2% to 5% of episodes of pyelonephritis and is more likely in infants than in older children. Focal renal abscesses are an uncommon complication.

The relapse rate of UTI is approximately 25% to 40%. Most relapses occur within 2 to 3 weeks of treatment. Parents should be counseled to follow up for evaluation for subsequent fevers to evaluate for the possibility of a recurrence of UTI. If a recurrent UTI is diagnosed, further imaging studies (VCUG) are indicated to evaluate the possibility of vesicoureteral reflux (see Chapter 167).

The remaining children have more mixed temperaments. The individual temperament of a child has important implications for parenting and for the advice a pediatrician may give in anticipatory guidance or behavioral problem counseling.

Although, to some degree, temperament may be hardwired (nature) in each child, the environment (nurture) inwhich the child grows has a strong effect on the child’s adjustment. Social and cultural factors can have marked effects on the child through differences in parenting style, educational approaches, and behavioral expectations.

Developmental and behavioral problems are more common than any category of problems in pediatrics, except acute infections and trauma. In 2008 15% of children ages 3 to 7 had a developmental disability, and others had behavioral disabilities. As many as 25% of children have serious psychosocial problems. Parents often neglect to mention these problems because they think the physician is uninterested or cannot help. It is necessary to monitor development and screen for the presence of these problems at health supervision visits, particularly in the years before preschool or early childhood learning center enrollment.

Development surveillance, done at every office visit, is an informal process comparing skill levels to lists of milestones. If suspicion of developmental or behavioral issues recurs, further evaluation is warranted (Table 8-1). Surveillance does not have a standard, and screening tests are necessary.

Developmental screening involves the use of standardized screening tests to identify children who require further diagnostic assessment. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the use of validated standardized screening tools at three of the health maintenance visits: 9 months, 18 months, and 30 months. Clinics and offices that serve a higher risk patient population (children living in poverty) often perform a screening test at every health maintenance visit. A child who fails to pass a developmental screening test requires more comprehensive evaluation but does not necessarily have a delay; definitive testing must confirm. Developmental evaluations for children with suspected delays and intervention services for children with diagnosed disabilities are available free to families. A combination of U.S. state and federal funds provides these services.

After a thorough neurologic examination, anteroposterior and lateral radiographs should be obtained. The goal isto rule out a nonmuscular etiology. A computed tomography (CT) scan or MRI of the head and neck is necessary forpersistent neck pain, neurologic symptoms, and persistentdeformity.

Treatment of muscular torticollis is aimed at increasing the range of motion of the neck and correcting the cosmetic deformity. Stretching exercises of the neck can be very beneficial for infants. Surgical management is indicated if patients do not improve with adequate stretching exercises in physical therapy. Postoperative physical therapy is needed to decrease the risk of recurrence. Treatment in patients with underlying disorders should target the disorder.

Back pain in the pediatric population should always be approached with concern. In contrast to adults, in whom back pain is frequently mechanical or psychological, back pain in children may be the result of organic causes, especially in preadolescents. Back pain lasting longer than a week requires a detailed investigation. In the pediatric population, approximately 85% of children with back pain for greater than 2 months have a specific lesion: 33% are posttraumatic (spondylolysis, occult fracture), 33% are developmental (kyphosis, scoliosis), and 18% have an infection or tumor. In the remaining 15%, the diagnosis is undetermined.

Not only are the A, P, and E binding sites for tRNAs formed primarily by ribosomal RNAs, but the catalytic site for peptide bond formation is also formed by RNA, as the nearest amino acid is located more than 1.8 nm away. This discovery came as a surprise to biologists because, unlike proteins, RNA does not contain easily ionizable functional groups that can be used to catalyze sophisticated reactions like peptide bond formation. Moreover, metal ions, which are often used by RNA molecules to catalyze chemical reactions (as discussed later in the chapter), were not observed at the active site of the ribosome. Instead, it is believed that the 23S rRNA forms a highly structured pocket that, through a network of hydrogen bonds, precisely orients the two reactants (the growing peptide chain and an aminoacyl-tRNA) and thereby greatly accelerates their covalent joining. An additional surprise came from the discovery that the tRNA in the P site contributes an important OH group to the active site and participates directly in the catalysis. This mechanism may ensure that catalysis occurs only when the P site tRNA is properly positioned in the ribosome.

RNA molecules that possess catalytic activity are known as ribozymes. We saw earlier in this chapter that some ribozymes function in self-splicing reactions. In the final section of this chapter, we consider what the ability of RNA molecules to function as catalysts might mean for the early evolution of living cells. For now, we merely note that there is good reason to suspect that RNA rather than protein molecules served as the first catalysts for living cells. If so, the ribosome, with its RNA core, may be a relic of an earlier time in life’s history—when protein synthesis evolved in cells that were run almost entirely by ribozymes.

Nucleotide Sequences in mRNA Signal Where to Start Protein Synthesis

document (1) 

Eukaryotic and bacterial ribosomes have similar structures and functions, being composed of one large and one small subunit that fit together to form a complete ribosome with a mass of several million daltons (Figure 6–61). The small subunit provides the framework on which the tRNAs are accurately matched to the codons of the mRNA, while the large subunit catalyzes the formation of the peptide bonds that link the amino acids together into a polypeptide chain (see Figure 6–58).

When not actively synthesizing proteins, the two subunits of the ribosome are separate. They join together on an mRNA molecule, usually near its 5ʹ end, to initiate the synthesis of a protein. The mRNA is then pulled through the ribosome, three nucleotides at a time. As its codons enter the core of the ribosome, the mRNA nucleotide sequence is translated into an amino acid sequence using the tRNAs as adaptors to add each amino acid in the correct sequence to the growing end of the polypeptide chain. When a stop codon is encountered, the ribosome releases the finished protein, and its two subunits separate again. These subunits can then be used to start the synthesis of another protein on another mRNA molecule. Ribosomes operate with remarkable efficiency: in one second, a eukaryotic ribosome adds 2 amino acids to a polypeptide chain; the ribosomes of bacterial cells operate even faster, at a rate of about 20 amino acids per second.

To choreograph the many coordinated movements required for efficient translation, a ribosome contains four binding sites for RNA molecules: one is for the mRNA and three (called the A site, the P site, and the E site) are for tRNAs (Figure 6–62). A tRNA molecule is held tightly at the A and P sites only if its anticodon

document (2) 

rial mRNAs have no 5ʹ caps to signal the ribosome where to begin searching for the start of translation. Instead, each bacterial mRNA contains a specific ribo- some-binding site (called the Shine–Dalgarno sequence, named after its discov-DISSOCIATE erers) that is located a few nucleotides upstream of the AUG at which translation

The mechanism for selecting a start codon in bacteria is different. Bacte is to begin. This nucleotide sequence, with the consensus 5ʹ-AGGAGGU-3ʹ, forms base pairs with the 16S rRNA of the small ribosomal subunit to position the initiating AUG codon in the ribosome. A set of translation initiation factors orchestrates this interaction, as well as the subsequent assembly of the large ribosomal subunit to complete the ribosome.

Unlike a eukaryotic ribosome, a bacterial ribosome can readily assemble directly on a start codon that lies in the interior of an mRNA molecule, so long as a ribosome-binding site precedes it by several nucleotides. As a result, bac-AMINOACYL terial mRNAs are often polycistronic—that is, they encode several different pro teins, each of which is translated from the same mRNA molecule (Figure 6–71). In contrast, a eukaryotic mRNA generally encodes only a single protein, or more accurately, a single set of closely related proteins.

Stop Codons Mark the End of Translation

The end of the protein-coding message is signaled by the presence of one of three stop codons (UAA, UAG, or UGA) (see Figure 6–48). These are not recognized by a tRNA and do not specify an amino acid, but instead signal to the ribosome to stop translation. Proteins known as release factors bind to any ribosome with a stop codon positioned in the A site, forcing the peptidyl transferase in the ribosome to catalyze the addition of a water molecule instead of an amino acid to the peptidyl-tRNA (Figure 6–72). This reaction frees the carboxyl end of the growing polypeptide chain from its attachment to a tRNA molecule, and since only this etc.

is termed the reading frame. The codons on mRNA are sequentially recognized by tRNA adaptor proteins. Specific enzymes termed aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases link a specific amino acid to a specific tRNA. The translation of mRNA to protein requires the ribosomal complex to move step-wise along the mRNA until the initiator methionine sequence is identified. In concert with various protein initiator factors, the methionyl-tRNA is positioned on the mRNA and protein synthesis begins. Each new amino acid is added sequentially by the appropriate tRNA in conjunction with proteins called elongation factors. Protein synthesis proceeds in the

2023-11-29 14:10:43,142 query: A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency room complaining of left shoulder pain for several weeks. He says that the pain often worsens when he tries to sleep on his left side. Although he tried several pain medications, none of the pain medications helped. He is an amateur tennis player who practices on weekends. He denies any trauma during his practice sessions. On examination of the shoulder joint, severe tenderness was present localized to the greater tuberosity of the left shoulder joint along with biceps tendon tenderness over the bicipital groove. The range of motion was limited to the left side. An X-ray of the joint showed narrowing of the acromiohumeral space with sclerosis and spurring of the acromion. Routine blood test results are normal except for the rheumatoid factor, which is positive. What is the most likely diagnosis?

FIGURE 157-1 Acute septic arthritis of the sternoclavicular joint.

A man in his forties with a history of cirrhosis presented with a new onset of fever and lower neck pain. He had no history of IV drug use or previous catheter placement. Jaundice and a painful swollen area over his left sternoclavicular joint were evident on physical examination. Cultures of blood drawn at admission grew group B Streptococcus. The patient recovered after treatment with IV penicillin. (Courtesy of Francisco M. Marty, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston; with permission.) common among patients with rheumatoid arthritis and may resemble a flare of the underlying disease.

The usual presentation consists of moderate to severe pain that is uniform around the joint, effusion, muscle spasm, and decreased range of motion. Fever in the range of 38.3–38.9°C (101–102°F) and sometimes higher is common but may not be present, especially in persons with rheumatoid arthritis, renal or hepatic insufficiency, or conditions requiring immunosuppressive therapy. The inflamed, swollen joint is usually evident on examination except in the case of a deeply situated joint such as the hip, shoulder, or sacroiliac joint. Cellulitis, bursitis, and acute osteomyelitis, which may produce a similar clinical picture, should be distinguished from septic arthritis by their greater range of motion and less-than-circumferential swelling. A focus of extraarticular infection, such as a boil or pneumonia, should be sought. Peripheral-blood leukocytosis with a left shift and elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein level are common.

Plain radiographs show evidence of soft-tissue swelling, joint-space widening, and displacement of tissue planes by the distended capsule. Narrowing of the joint space and bony erosions indicate advanced infection and a poor prognosis. Ultrasound is useful for detecting effusions in the hip, and CT or MRI can demonstrate infections of the sacroiliac joint, the sternoclavicular joint, and the spine very well.

The immune response occurs when immunologically competent cells are activated in response to foreign organisms or antigenic substances liberated during the acute or chronic inflammatory response. The outcome of the immune response for the host may be deleterious if it leads to chronic inflammation without resolution of the underlying injurious process (see Chapter 55). Chronic inflammation involves the release of multiple cytokines and chemokines plus a very complex interplay of immunoactive cells. The whole range of autoimmune diseases (eg, RA, vasculitis, SLE) and inflammatory conditions (eg, gout) derive from abnormalities in this cascade.

The incidence of RA increases between 25 and 55 years of age, after which it plateaus until the age of 75 and then decreases. The presenting symptoms of RA typically result from inflammation of the joints, tendons, and bursae. Patients often complain of early morning joint stiffness lasting more than 1 h that eases with physical activity. The earliest involved joints are typically the small joints of the hands and feet. The initial pattern of joint involvement may be monoarticular, oligoarticular (≤4 joints), or polyarticular (>5 joints), usually in a symmetric distribution. Some patients with inflammatory arthritis will present with too few affected joints to be classified as having RA— so-calledundifferentiatedinflammatoryarthritis.Thosewithanundifferentiated arthritis who are most likely to be diagnosed later with RA have a higher number of tender and swollen joints, test positive for serum rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-CCP antibodies, and have higher scores for physical disability.

Once the disease process of RA is established, the wrists, metacarpophalangeal (MCP), and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints stand out as the most frequently involved joints (Fig. 380-1). Distal interphalangeal(DIP)jointinvolvementmayoccurinRA,butitusuallyisa manifestation of coexistent osteoarthritis. Flexor tendon tenosynovitis is a frequent hallmark of RA and leads to decreased range of motion, reduced grip strength, and “trigger” fingers. Progressive destruction of the joints and soft tissues may lead to chronic, irreversible deformities. Ulnar deviation results from subluxation of the MCP joints, with subluxation of the proximal phalanx to the volar side of the hand.

Local tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus is characteristic. Plain radiographs of the shoulder may be normal or show a calcium deposit in the supraspinatus tendon or subacromial bursa. MRI is able to demonstrate more subtle abnormalities, such as muscle and tendon tears of the rotator cuff or a labral tear of the joint capsule. In most patients the pain subsides gradually with immobilization and

Pain localized to the shoulder region, worsened by motion, and associated with tenderness and limitation of movement, especially internal and external rotation and abduction, points to a tendonitis, subacromial bursitis, or tear of the rotator cuff, which is made up of the tendons of the muscles surrounding the shoulder joint. The term bursitis is often used loosely to designate these disorders. Shoulder pain, like spine and plexus pain, may radiate vaguely into the arm and rarely into the hand, but sensorimotor and reflex changes—which always indicate disease of nerve roots, plexus, or nerves—are absent.

with immobilization and analgesics followed by a program of increasing shoulder mobilization. If it does not, the injection of small amounts of corticosteroids into the bursa, or the site of major pain indicated by passive shoulder movement in the case of rotator cuff injuries, is often temporarily effective and allows the patient to mobilize the shoulder. The problem of the “frozen shoulder” is addressed further on.

Other important hormonal changes also occur in conjunction with puberty. Growth hormone (GH) levels increase early in puberty, stimulated in part by the pubertal increases in estrogen secretion. GH increases insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), which enhances linear growth. The growth spurt is generally less pronounced in girls than in boys, with a peak growth velocity of ~7 cm/year. Linear growth is ultimately limited by closure of epiphyses in the long bones as a result of prolonged exposure to estrogen. Puberty is also associated with mild insulin resistance.

The differential diagnosis of precocious and delayed puberty is similar in boys (Chap. 411) and girls. However, there are differences in the timing of normal puberty and differences in the relative frequency of specific disorders in girls compared with boys.

Precocious Puberty Traditionally, precocious puberty has been defined as the development of secondary sexual characteristics before the age of 8 in girls based on data from Marshall and Tanner in British girls studied in the 1960s. More recent studies led to recommendations that girls be evaluated for precocious puberty if breast development or pubic hair is present at <7 years of age for white girls or <6 years for black girls.

Duration of normal menstruation is between 2 to 7 days, with a flow of less than 80 mL,  cycling every 21 to 35 days.27 Nonpregnant patients, who present with heavy bleeding and are 35 years of age and older or have risk factors for endometrial cancer, must be ruled out for malignancy as the first step in their management (see earlier section, “Endometrial Biopsy”).Abnormal Uterine Bleeding. The classification of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) has been recently updated.28 Abnormal uterine bleeding may be heavy (AUB/HMB) or intermenstrual (AUB/IMB) and is further divided

With regard to breast development (Fig. 29.3), Tanner stage 1 refers to the prepubertal state and includes no palpable breast tissue, with the areolae generally less than 2 cm in diameter. The nipples may be inverted, ﬂat, or raised. In Tanner stage 2, breast budding occurs, with a visible and palpable mound of breast tissue. The areolae begin to enlarge, the skin of the areolae thins, and the nipple develops to varying degrees. Tanner stage 3 is reﬂected by further growth and elevation of the entire breast. When the individual is seated and viewed from the side, the nipple is generally at or above the midplane of breast tissue. In most girls, Tanner stage 4 is defined by projection of the areola and papilla above the general breast contour in a secondary mound. Breast development is incomplete until Tanner stage 5, in which the breast is mature in contour and proportion. In most women, the nipple is more pigmented at this stage than earlier in

The nipple is generally below the midplane of breast tissue when the woman is seated and viewed from the side. Full breast development usually occurs over 3 to 3.5 years, but it may occur in as little as 2 years or not progress beyond stage 4 until the first pregnancy. Breast size is no indication of breast maturity.

In addition, some patients have a prolonged baseline PTT due to factor deficiency or inhibitors (which could increase bleeding risk) or lupus anticoagulant (which is not associated with bleeding risk but may be associated with thrombosis risk). Using the PTT to assess heparin effect in such patients is problematic. An alternative is to use anti-Xa activity to assess heparin concentration, a test now widely available on automated coagulation instruments. This approach measures heparin concentration; however, it does not provide the global assessment of intrinsic pathway integrity of the PTT.

The following strategy is recommended: prior to initiating anticoagulant therapy of any type, the integrity of the patient’s hemostatic system should be assessed by a careful history of prior bleeding events, as well as baseline PT and PTT. If there is a prolonged clotting time, the cause of this (deficiency or inhibitor) should be determined prior to initiating therapy, and treatment goals stratified to a risk-benefit assessment. In high-risk patients measuring both the PTT and anti-Xa activity may be useful. When intermittent heparin administration is used, the aPTT or anti-Xa activity should be measured 6 hours after the administered dose to maintain prolongation of the aPTT to 2–2.5 times that of the control value. However, LMW heparin therapy is the preferred option in this case, as no monitoring is required in most patients.

Continuous intravenous administration of heparin is accomplished via an infusion pump. After an initial bolus injection of 80–100 units/kg, a continuous infusion of about 15–22 units/kg per hour is required to maintain the anti-Xa activity in the range of 0.3–0.7 units/mL. Low-dose prophylaxis is achieved with subcutaneous administration of heparin, 5000 units every 8–12 hours. Because of the danger of hematoma formation at the injection site, heparin must never be administered intramuscularly.

Patients can present with fatigue, malaise, nausea, vomiting, anorexic fever, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The most com-mon physical findings are jaundice and hepatomegaly. Because the disease is self-limited, the treatment is usually supportive. Patients who develop fulminant infection require aggressive therapy and should be transferred to a center capable of per-forming liver transplantation.Hepatitis B and C, on the other hand, can both lead to chronic liver

• Timing of Delivery

Several factors afect this timing and include gestational age, fetal growth, lung maturity, and presence of maternal complications. As measured by determination of the lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio, pulmonary maturation is usually synchronous in twins (Leveno, 1984). Moreover, although this ratio usually does not exceed 2.0 until 36 weeks in singleton pregnancies, it oten exceeds this value by approximately 32 weeks in multifetal pregnancies. Similar increased values of surfactant have been noted in twins after 31 weeks' gestation (McElrath, 2000). In a comparison of respiratory morbidity in 100 twins and 241 singleton newborns delivered by cesarean before labor, Ghi and associates (2013) found less neonatal respiratory morbidity in twins, especially those delivered <37 weeks' gestation. In some cases, however, pulmonary function may be markedly diferent, and the smallest, most stressed twin fetus is typically more mature.

At the other end of the spectrum, Bennett and Dunn (1969) suggested that a twin pregnancy of 40 weeks or more should be considered postterm. Twin stillborn neonates delivered at 40 weeks or beyond commonly had features similar to those of postmature singletons (Chap. 43, p. 836). From an analysis of almost 300,000 twin births, at and beyond 39 weeks, the risk of subsequent stillbirth was greater than the risk of neonatal mortality (Kahn, 2003).

From their guidelines, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2016) recommends delivery at 38 weeks for uncomplicated dichorionic twin pregnancies. Women with uncomplicated monochorionic diamnionic twin pregnancies can undergo delivery between 34 and weeks. And, for women with monoamnionic twin pregnancies, delivery is recommended at 32 to 34 weeks. At Parkland Hospital, we generally follow these recommendations but do not routinely deliver monochorionic diamnionic twin pregnancies before 37 weeks unless another obstetrical indication develops.

Even in their absence, rates of stillbirth, growth restriction, nonreassUfing heart rate pattern, and meconium aspiration syndrome were higher than in nonafected pregnancies. Petrozella and associates (2011) similarly reported that an AFI :;5 em identiied between 24 and 34 weeks was associated with increased risks for stillbirth, spontaneous or medically indicated preterm birth, heart rate pattern abnormalities, and growth restriction (see Table 11-4). In one metaanalysis comprising more than 10,000 pregnancies, women with oligohydramnios had a twofold greater risk for cesarean delivery for fetal distress and a ivefold higher risk for an Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes compared with pregnancies with a normal AFI (Chauhan, 1999).

For more mature preterm breech fetuses, that is, between 32 and 37 weeks, again there are sparse data to guide delivery route selection. Bergenhenegouwen and coworkers (2015) studied more than 6800 breech deliveries in a subgroup between 32 and 37 weeks. With planned cesarean delivery, they found similar perinatal mortality rates but less composite mortality and severe morbidity. It appears in this subgroup that fetal weight rather than gestational age is likely more important. he Maternl-Fetal Nfedicine Committee of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) states that vaginal breech delivery is reasonable when the estimated fetal weight is >2500 g (Kotaska, 2009). There are especial concerns for delivery of the second noncephalic-presenting twin fetus that are discussed in Chapter 45 (p. 888).

In the United States, all these findings shape practice, and cesarean delivery is almost uniformly favored for the preterm breech fetus for which resuscitation is planned.

Viral Dynamics The dynamics of viral production and turnover have been quantified using mathematical modeling in the setting of the administration of reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors to HIV-infected individuals in clinical studies. Treatment with these drugs resulted in a precipitous decline in the level of plasma viremia, which typically fell by well over 90% within 2 weeks. The number of CD4+ T cells in the blood increased concurrently, which suggested that the Productively infected Latently infected per milliliter in the absence of therapy, there is virtually 1231 CD4+ lymphocytes CD4+ lymphocytes always some degree of ongoing virus replication.

In untreated patients or in patients in whom therapy has not adequately controlled virus replication, after a variable period, usually measured in years, the CD4+ T cell count falls below a critical level (<200/μL) and the patient becomes highly susceptible to opportunistic disease (Fig. 226-17). For this reason, the CDC case definition of AIDS includes all HIV-infected individuals over 5 years of age with CD4+ T cell counts below this level (Table 226-2). Patients may experience constitutional signs and symptoms or may develop an opportunistic disease abruptly without any prior symptoms, although the latter scenario is unusual.

24–11 CD4 proteins on helper and regulatory T cells serve as co-receptors that bind to invariant parts of class II MHC proteins. CD4 is thought to increase the adhesion between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that are initially connected only weakly by the T cell receptor bound to its specific peptide–MHC complex. To test this possibility, you label cell-surface MHC molecules with a fluorescently labeled peptide so that you can detect individual peptide–MHC complexes at the interface between the APCs and the T cells in a culture dish. To detect T cell responses—the sign of a productive contact—you load them with a Ca2+ indicator dye, as cytosolic Ca2+ increases when lymphocytes are active. You now count the peptide– MHC complexes at a large number of interfaces (immunological synapses) and measure the resulting uptake of Ca2+ in the adherent T cells (Figure Q24–4, red circles). When you repeat the experiment in the presence of blocking antibodies against CD4, you get a different result (blue circles). Do these results support or refute the notion that CD4 augments T cell receptor binding? Explain your answer.

CD4+ lymphocytes infected with defective viruses

FIGuRE 226-21 Dynamics of HIV infection in vivo. See text for detailed description. (From AS Perelson et al: Science 271:1582, 1996.) killing of CD4+ T cells was linked directly to the levels of replicating virus. However, a significant component of the early rise in CD4+ T cell numbers following the initiation of therapy may be due to the redistribution of cells into the peripheral blood from other tissue compartments throughout the body as a consequence of therapy-related diminution in viremia-associated immune system activation. It was determined on the basis of modeling the kinetics of viral decline and the emergence of resistant mutants during therapy that 93–99% of the circulating virus originated from recently infected, rapidly turning over CD4+ T cells and that ~1–7% of circulating virus originated from longer-lived cells, likely monocytes/macrophages. A negligible amount of circulating virus originated from the pool of latently infected cells (Fig. 226-21). It was also determined that the half-life of a circulating virion was ~30–60 min and that of productively infected cells was 1 day. Given the relatively steady level of plasma viremia and of infected cells, it appears that extremely large amounts of virus (~1010–1011 virions) are produced and cleared from the circulation each day. In addition, data suggest that the minimal duration of the HIV-1 replication cycle in vivo is ~2 days. Other studies have demonstrated that the decrease in plasma viremia that results from cART correlates closely with a decrease in virus replication in lymph nodes, further confirming that lymphoid tissue is the main site of HIV replication and the main source of plasma viremia.

The level of steady-state viremia, called the viral set point, at ~1 year following acquisition of HIV infection has important uncommon for CD4+ T cell counts in the untreated patient to drop to as low as 10/μL or even to zero. In for opportunistic infections are readily accessible to such patients, survival is increased dramatically even in those patients with advanced HIV disease. In contrast, untreated patients who progress to this severest form of immunodeficiency usually succumb to opportunistic infections or neoplasms (see below).

the CD4 count is felt by many to be optional. There are a handful of clinical situations in which the CD4+ T cell count may be misleading. Patients with HTLV-1/HIV co-infection may have elevated CD4+ T cell counts that do not accurately reflect their degree of immune competence. In patients with hypersplenism or those who have undergone splenectomy, and in patients receiving medications that suppress the bone marrow such as IFN-α, the CD4+ T cell percentage may be a more reliable indication of immune function than the CD4+ T cell count.

In addition, the secreted factors help activate macrophages to produce mediators such as NO, which are capable of destroying the invading pathogen. Furthermore, activation of the macrophages by the secreted factor eventually leads to the formation of a tubercle.

Pathogens of all types are ingested by macrophages from the extracellular fluid, and are often destroyed without the need for additional macrophage activation. In several clinically important infections, such as those caused by mycobacteria, ingested pathogens are not killed, and can even set up a chronic infection in macrophages and incapacitate them. Such microorganisms are able to maintain themselves in the hostile environment of phagosomes— shielded from the effects of both antibodies and cytotoxic T cells—by inhibiting the fusion of phagosomes and lysosomes, or by preventing the acidification required to activate lysosomal proteases. Nevertheless, peptides derived from such microorganisms can be displayed by MHC class II molecules on the macrophage surface, where they are recognized by antigen-specific effector TH1 cells. The TH1 cell is stimulated to synthesize membrane-associated proteins and soluble cytokines that enhance the macrophage’s antimicrobial defenses and enable it to either eliminate the pathogen or control its growth and spread. This boost to antimicrobial mechanisms is known as ‘classical’ macrophage activation, the result of which is the so-called classically-activated, or M1, macrophage (Fig. 11.11).

Macrophages require two main signals for classical activation, and effector TH1 cells can deliver both. One signal is the cytokine IFN-γ; the other, CD40L, sensitizes the macrophage to respond to IFN-γ (see Fig. 11.10). TH1 cells also secrete lymphotoxin, which can substitute for CD40 ligand in M1 macrophage activation. The M1 macrophage is a potent antimicrobial effector cell. Phagosomes fuse with lysosomes, and microbicidal reactive oxygen and

11-7 Chronic activation of macrophages by TH1 cells mediates the formation of granulomas to contain intracellular pathogens that cannot be cleared.

Some intracellular pathogens, most notably Mycobacterium tuberculosis, are sufficiently resistant to the microbicidal effects of activated macrophages that they are incompletely eliminated by a type 1 response. This gives rise to chronic, low-level infection that requires an ongoing TH1 response to prevent pathogen proliferation and spread. In this circumstance, chronic coordination between TH1 cells and macrophages underlies the formation of the immunological reaction called the granuloma, in which microbes are held in check within a central area of macrophages surrounded by activated lymphocytes (Fig. 11.13). A characteristic feature of granulomas is the fusion of several macrophages to form multinucleated giant cells, which can be found at the border of the central focus of activated macrophages and the lymphocytes that surround them and which appear to have heightened antimicrobial activity. A granuloma serves to ‘wall off’ pathogens that resist destruction. In tuberculosis, the centers of large granulomas can become isolated and the cells there die, probably from a combination of lack of oxygen and the cytotoxic effects of activated macrophages. As the dead tissue in the center resembles cheese, this process is called ‘caseous’ necrosis. Thus, the chronic activation of TH1 cells can cause significant pathology. The absence of the TH1 response, however, leads to the more serious consequence of death from disseminated infection, which is now seen frequently in patients with AIDS and concomitant mycobacterial infection.

11-8 Defects in type 1 immunity reveal its important role in the elimination of intracellular pathogens.

document (3) 

In addition to increased intracellular killing, TH1 cells induce other changes in macrophages that help to amplify the adaptive immune response against intracellular pathogens. These changes include an increase in the number of MHC class II molecules, B7 molecules, CD40, and TNF receptors on the M1 macrophage surface (see Figs. 11.10 and 11.11), making the cell more effective at presenting antigen to T cells, and more responsive to CD40 ligand and TNF-α. In addition, M1 macrophages secrete IL-12, which increases the amount of IFN-γ produced by ILC1s and TH1 cells. This also promotes the differentiation of activated naive CD4 T cells into TH1 effector cells, and naive CD8 T cells into cytotoxic effectors (see Sections 9-20 and 9-18).

Another important function of TH1 cells is the recruitment of additional phagocytic cells to sites of infection. TH1 cells recruit macrophages by two mechanisms (Fig. 11.12). First, they make the hematopoietic growth factors IL-3 and GM-CSF, which stimulate the production of new monocytes in the bone marrow. Second, the TNF-α and lymphotoxin secreted by TH1 cells at sites of infection change the surface properties of endothelial cells so that monocytes adhere to them. Chemokines such as CCL2, which are induced by TH1 cells at inflammatory sites, direct the migration of monocytes through the vascular endothelium and into the infected tissue, where they differentiate into macrophages (see Section 3-17). Cytokines and chemokines secreted by M1 macrophages themselves are also important in recruiting other monocytes to sites of infection. Collectively, these TH1-mediated effects provide a positive feedback loop that amplifies and sustains type 1 responses until the pathogen is controlled or eliminated.

As already mentioned, the deaf child makes the transition from crying to cooing and babbling at the usual age of 3 to 5 months. After the sixth month, however, the child becomes much quieter, and the usual repertoire of babbling sounds becomes stereotyped and unchanging, though still uttered with pleasant voice. A more conspicuous failure comes somewhat later, when babbling fails to give way to word formation. Should deafness develop within the first few years of life, the child gradually loses such speech as had been acquired but can be retaught by the lipreading method. Speech, however, is harsh, poorly modulated, and unpleasant, and accompanied by many peculiar squeals and snorting or grunting noises. Social and other acquisitions appear at the expected times in the congenitally deaf child, unlike in the developmentally delayed child. The deaf child seems eager to communicate and makes known all his needs by gesture or pantomime, often very cleverly. The deaf child may attract attention by vivid facial expressions, motions of the lips, nodding, or head shaking. The Leiter performance scale, which makes no use of sounds, will show that intelligence is normal. Deafness can be demonstrated at an early age by careful observation of the child’s responses to sounds and by free-field audiometry, but the full range of hearing cannot be accurately tested before the age of 3 or 4 years. Recording of brainstem auditory evoked potentials and testing of the labyrinths, which are frequently unresponsive in deaf mutes, may be helpful. Early diagnosis is important so as to fit the child with a hearing aid and to begin appropriate language training.

In contrast to the child in whom deafness is the only abnormality, the developmentally delayed child generally talks little but may display a rich personality. Autistic children may also be mute; if they speak, echolalia is prominent and the personal “I” is avoided. Blind children of normal intelligence tend to speak slowly and fail to acquire imitative gestures.

Women who conceive with an IUD in place are more likely to have a tubal pregnancy than those not using contraceptives.

This suggests that while the intrauterine device decreases the risk of pregnancy overall, if a failure does occur, the device is more successful at preventing intrauterine pregnancy than tubal pregnancy. Past IUD use may slightly increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy.

It often requires 4–6 years of clinical testing to accumulate and analyze all required data. Testing in humans is begun only after sufficient acute and subacute animal toxicity studies have been completed. Chronic safety testing in animals, including carcinogenicity studies, is usually done concurrently with clinical trials. In each phase of the clinical trials, volunteers or patients must be informed of the investigational status of the drug as well as the possible risks and must be allowed to decline or to consent to participate and receive the drug. In addition to the approval of the sponsoring organization and the FDA, an interdisciplinary institutional review board (IRB) at each facility where the clinical drug trial will be conducted must review and approve the scientific and ethical plans for testing in humans.

In phase 1, the effects of the drug as a function of dosage are established in a small number (20–100) of healthy volunteers. If the drug is expected to have significant toxicity, as may be the case in cancer and AIDS therapy, volunteer patients with the disease participate in phase 1 rather than normal volunteers. Phase 1 trials are done to determine the probable limits of the safe clinical dosage range. These trials may be nonblind or “open”; that is, both the investigators and the subjects know what is being given. Alternatively, they may be “blinded” and placebo controlled. Many predictable toxicities are detected in this phase. Pharmacokinetic measurements of absorption, half-life, and metabolism are often done. Phase 1 studies are usually performed in research centers by specially trained clinical pharmacologists.

In phase 2, the drug is studied in patients with the target disease to determine its efficacy (“proof of concept”), and the

Analytic studies are often subdivided into experimental studies (clinical trials) and observational studies (cohort studies, case-control studies, and cross-sectional studies).

Descriptive studies (case reports and case series) often provide useful information for informing future analytic studies.

The common types of clinical research study methods, considerations for the strength of evidence for the specific study design, and interpretation of the results are presented. Although there is debate about which system should be used for evaluating the strength of evidence from an individual study, a well-designed and executed clinical trial presents the highest level of evidence (2). Other types of studies should be designed to best approach the strengths of a clinical trial.

Clinical Trials Clinical trials include intervention studies where the assignment to the treatment or control condition is controlled by the investigator and the outcomes to be measured are clearly defined at the time the trial is designed. Features of randomized clinical trials include randomization (in which participants are randomly assigned to exposures), unbiased assessment of outcome, and analysis of all participants based on the assigned exposure (an “intention to treat” analysis).

There are many different types of clinical trials, including studies designed to evaluate treatments, prevention techniques, community interventions, quality-of-life improvements, and diagnostic or screening approaches (3). Since 2007, investigators conducting randomized clinical trials are expected to register the trial to comply with mandatory registration and results reporting requirements (4).

Clinical Trial Phases New investigational drugs or treatments are usually evaluated by clinical trials in phases with more people being involved as the purpose of the study becomes more inclusive (3).

Phase I Trials In these trials, researchers test an experimental drug or treatment for the first time in a small group of people (20–80) to evaluate its safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects.

Phase II Trials In these, the experimental study drug or treatment is given to a larger group of people (100–300) to see whether it is effective and to further evaluate its safety.

Phase III Trials In phase III trials, the experimental study drug or treatment is given to large groups of people (1,000–3,000) to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow the experimental drug or treatment to be used safely.

Monitoring of serum antiepileptic drug levels can be very useful for establishing the initial dosing schedule. However, the published therapeutic ranges of serum drug concentrations are only an approximate guide for determining the proper dose for a given patient. The key determinants are the clinical measures of seizure frequency and presence of side effects, not the laboratory values. Conventional assays of serum drug levels measure the total drug (i.e., both free and protein bound). However, it is the concentration of free drug that reflects extracellular levels in the brain and correlates best with efficacy. Thus, patients with decreased levels of serum proteins (e.g., decreased serum albumin due to impaired liver or renal function) may have an increased ratio of free to bound drug, yet the concentration of free drug may be adequate for seizure control. These patients may have a “subtherapeutic” drug level, but the dose should be changed only if seizures remain uncontrolled, not just to achieve a “therapeutic” level. It is also useful to monitor free drug levels in such patients. In practice, other than during the initiation or modification of therapy, monitoring of antiepileptic drug levels is most useful for documenting adherence.

If seizures continue despite gradual increases to the maximum tolerated dose and documented compliance, then it becomes necessary to switch to another antiepileptic drug. This is usually done by maintaining the patient on the first drug while a second drug is added. The dose of the second drug should be adjusted to decrease seizure frequency without causing toxicity. Once this is achieved, the first drug can be gradually withdrawn (usually over weeks unless there is significant toxicity). The dose of the second drug is then further optimized based on seizure response and side effects. Monotherapy should be the goal whenever possible.

document (3) 

Chronic antiseizure drug administration prevents the occurrence of seizures, which can, on occasion, be life threatening. Therefore, adequate drug exposure must be continuously maintained. However, many antiseizure drugs also have a narrow therapeutic window; dosing must therefore avoid excessive, toxic exposure. An understanding of the pharmacokinetic properties of the drugs is essential. It is also necessary for the clinician to be cognizant of special factors that affect dosing; these factors include nonlinear relationships between dose and drug exposure and the influence of hepatic or renal impairment on clearance (see Chapters 3 and 4). Further, drug-drug

This patient developed hypokalemia due to a redistribution of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular compartments; this pathophysiology was readily apparent following calculation of the TTKG. The TTKG is calculated as (P × U )/(P ×

U ). The expected values for the TTKG are <3 in the presence of hypokalemia and >7–8 in the presence of hyperkalemia (see also Case 2 and Case 8). Alternatively, a urinary K+-to-creatinine ratio of >13 mmol/g creatinine (>1.5 mmol/mmol creatinine) is compatible with excessive renal K+ excretion. In this case, the calculated TTKG was 2.5, consistent with appropriate renal conservation of K+ and a nonrenal cause for hypokalemia. In the absence of significant gastrointestinal loss of K+, the patient was diagnosed with a “redistributive” subtype of hypokalemia.

In patients in whom estrogen replacement therapy is contraindicated, such as those with estrogen-sensitive tumors, relief of vasomotor symptoms may be obtained by the use of clonidine.

C. Other Uses

Estrogens combined with progestins can be used to suppress ovulation in patients with intractable dysmenorrhea or when suppression of ovarian function is used in the treatment of hirsutism and amenorrhea due to excessive secretion of androgens by the ovary. Under these circumstances, greater suppression may be needed, and oral contraceptives containing 50 mcg of estrogen or a combination of a low-estrogen pill with GnRH suppression may be required.

Adverse effects of variable severity have been reported with the therapeutic use of estrogens. Many other effects reported in conjunction with hormonal contraceptives may be related to their estrogen content. These are discussed below.

A. Uterine Bleeding

Estrogen therapy is a major cause of postmenopausal uterine bleeding. Unfortunately, vaginal bleeding at this time of life may also be due to carcinoma of the endometrium. To avoid confusion, patients should be treated with the smallest amount of estrogen possible. It should be given cyclically so that bleeding, if it occurs, will be more likely to occur during the withdrawal period. As noted above, endometrial hyperplasia can be prevented by administration of a progestational agent with estrogen in each cycle.

B. Cancer

A. Therapeutic Applications

The major uses of progestational hormones are for hormone replacement therapy (see above) and hormonal contraception (see below). In addition, they are useful in producing long-term ovarian suppression for other purposes. When used alone in large doses parenterally (eg, medroxyprogesterone acetate, 150 mg intramuscularly every 90 days), prolonged anovulation and amenorrhea result. This therapy has been employed in the treatment of dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, and bleeding disorders when estrogens are contraindicated, and for contraception. The major problem with this regimen is the prolonged time required in some patients for ovulatory function to return after cessation of therapy. It should not be used for patients planning a pregnancy in the near future. Similar regimens will relieve hot flushes in some menopausal women and can be used if estrogen therapy is contraindicated.

Medroxyprogesterone acetate, 10–20 mg orally twice weekly— or intramuscularly in doses of 100 mg/m2 every 1–2 weeks—will prevent menstruation, but it will not arrest accelerated bone maturation in children with precocious puberty.

Progestins do not appear to have any place in the therapy of threatened or habitual abortion. Early reports of the usefulness of these agents resulted from the unwarranted assumption that after several abortions the likelihood of repeated abortions was over 90%. When progestational agents were administered to patients with previous abortions, a salvage rate of 80% was achieved. It is now recognized that similar patients abort only 20% of the time even when untreated. On the other hand, progesterone was given experimentally to delay premature labor with encouraging results.

Progesterone and medroxyprogesterone have been used in the treatment of women who have difficulty in conceiving and who demonstrate a slow rise in basal body temperature. There is no convincing evidence that this treatment is effective.

Preparations of progesterone and medroxyprogesterone have been used to treat premenstrual syndrome. Controlled studies have not confirmed the effectiveness of such therapy except when doses sufficient to suppress ovulation have been used.

Eﬂornithine Hydrochloride Eﬂornithine hydrochloride is a topical cream that is approved by the FDA for use on the face and chin. Improvements in facial hirsutism may be seen in 4 to 8 weeks of twice-daily applications.

Ovulation Induction A large subset of patients with amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea and chronic anovulation seek care because they are unable to conceive (see Chapter 32). Ovulation induction therapy is generally the treatment of choice for such patients, but pretreatment counseling should be provided in sufficient detail to ensure realistic expectations. The patient should be provided with information regarding the chances of a successful pregnancy (considering age of the patient and treatment modality), potential complications (hyperstimulation and multiple gestation), expense, time, and psychological impact involved in completing the course of therapy. Treatment should be individualized (136).

Earlier studies raised the possibility of a relationship between ovulation induction and the risk of ovarian cancer (137,138). Ongoing studies are attempting to address this issue conclusively, but data support an increase of approximately 2.5-fold in ovarian cancer in patients with infertility, which appears unrelated to the use of ovulation-inducing drugs (139140). There is no conclusive evidence to link fertility drug use and ovarian cancer; thus, no change in current ovulation induction practices seems warranted at present (141). Pregnancy and use of oral contraceptives before or after childbearing may protect against ovarian cancer.

Ovulatory Factor Ovulatory factor accounts for 30% to 40% of all cases of female infertility. Initial diagnoses among women with ovulatory factor infertility may include anovulation (complete absence of ovulation) or oligo-ovulation (infrequent ovulation). Menstrual history may be suggestive if oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea, polymenorrhea, or dysfunctional uterine bleeding is present (124). Menstrual dysfunction is present in 18% to 20% of the general population (125). Figure 32.5 shows the ﬂuctuations of E2, progesterone, FSH, and LH in a normal, 28-day ovulatory cycle. The normal length of the menstrual cycle in reproductive-age women varies from 21 to 35 days, with a mean of 27 to 29 days (126). Most of the variability in cycle length occurs during the follicular phase (127), but the luteal phase, often considered to be fixed at 14 days, can range from 7 to 19 days (128). Even women with regular monthly menses may have anovulation, although the presence of moliminal symptoms such as premenstrual breast swelling, bloating, and mood changes are much more suggestive of ovulatory cycles (125).

Methods to Document Ovulation

The “Fertile Window” The fertile window is the 6 day interval ending on the day of ovulation, but not after ovulation. Sperm can survive for up to 6 days in well-estrogenized cervical mucus, but the egg may be fertilizable for less than a day. Daily intercourse during this window may increase the probability of conception (32,127). The average woman is fertile between days 10 and 17 of the menstrual cycle, but many women can conceive outside of this range (128). Therefore, if timed intercourse is too cumbersome, intercourse two to three times weekly throughout the menstrual cycle will likely result in at least some of those occasions falling within the fertile window (129). Duration of abstinence prior to the fertile window has not been established, although one author suggests 5 days (127).

Foley or suprapubic catheters may be required for lower urinary tract obstruction (e.g., BPH).

Left untreated, hydronephrosis resulting from urinary obstruction leads to hypertension, acute or chronic renal failure, or sepsis, and has a very poor prognosis.

Retrograde projection of urine from the bladder to the ureters and kidneys. Often caused by insufficient tunneling of the ureters into submucosal bladder tissue, leading to ineffective restriction of retrograde urine ﬂow during bladder contraction. May also be due to posterior urethral valves, urethral or meatal stenosis, or a neurogenic bladder. Classified as follows:

Mild refux (grades I–II): No ureteral or renal pelvic dilation. Often resolves spontaneously.

Moderate to severe refux (grade III–V): Ureteral dilation with associated caliceal blunting in severe cases.

Patients present with recurrent UTIs, typically in childhood. Prenatal ultrasound may identify hydronephrosis.

Obtain a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) to detect abnormalities at ureteral insertion sites and to classify the grade of reﬂ ux.

Treat infections aggressively. Treat mild reﬂux with daily prophylactic antibiotics (amoxicillin if < 2 months of age; otherwise TMP-SMX or nitrofurantoin) until reﬂ ux resolves.

Surgery (ureteral reimplantation) is generally reserved for children with persistent high-grade (III to V) reﬂux or for those with breakthrough pyelonephritis while on prophylaxis. Inadequate treatment can lead to progressive renal scarring and ESRD.

Initial catheterization prior to starting antibiotics. treatment with parenteral antibiotics is determined by clinical status. Parenteral antibiotics should be continued until there is clinical improvement (typically 24 to 48 hours). Specificantibiotic therapy should be guided by the local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and the results of the patient’surine cultures because of increasing problems related to antimicrobial resistance. Commonly used parenteral antibiotics include ceftriaxone or gentamicin. Oral regimens include acephalosporin, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, or trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole. Infants and children who do notshow the expected clinical response within 2 days of startingantimicrobial therapy should be re-evaluated, have anotherurine specimen obtained for culture, and undergo imagingpromptly.

The degree of toxicity, dehydration, and ability to retain oral intake of fluids should be assessed carefully. Restoring or maintaining adequate hydration, including correction of electrolyte abnormalities that are often associated with vomiting or poor oral intake, is important.

Bacteremia occurs in 2% to 5% of episodes of pyelonephritis and is more likely in infants than in older children. Focal renal abscesses are an uncommon complication.

The relapse rate of UTI is approximately 25% to 40%. Most relapses occur within 2 to 3 weeks of treatment. Parents should be counseled to follow up for evaluation for subsequent fevers to evaluate for the possibility of a recurrence of UTI. If a recurrent UTI is diagnosed, further imaging studies (VCUG) are indicated to evaluate the possibility of vesicoureteral reflux (see Chapter 167).

Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7°C [101.7°F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia. A CT scan is not concerning for lesions or elevated intracranial pressure. The plan is to start empiric antibiotics and perform a lumbar puncture to rule out bacterial meningitis.

A 68-year-old man presents with a complaint of light-headedness on standing that is worse after meals and in hot environments. Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson’s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the α1 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension. Physical examination is otherwise unre-markable with no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or parkinsonian features. Laboratory examinations are negative except for plasma norepinephrine, which is low at 98 pg/mL (normal for his age 250–400 pg/mL). A diagnosis of pure autonomic failure is made, based on the clinical picture and the absence of drugs that could induce orthostatic hypoten-sion and diseases commonly associated with autonomic neuropathy (eg, diabetes, Parkinson’s disease). What precau-tions should this patient observe in using sympathomimetic drugs? Can such drugs be used in his treatment?

The sympathetic nervous system is an important regulator of virtually all organ systems. This is particularly evident in the regulation of blood pressure. As illustrated in the case study, the autonomic nervous system is crucial for the maintenance of blood pressure even under relatively minor situations of stress (eg, the gravitational stress of standing).

The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly.

The plasma Na+ concentration on admission was 113 meq/L, with a creatinine of 2.35 (Table 64e-1). At hospital hour 7, the plasma Na+ concentration was 120 meq/L, potassium 5.4 meq/L, chloride 90 64e-5 meq/L, bicarbonate 22 meq/L, BUN 32 mg/dL, creatinine 2.02 mg/dL, glucose 89 mg/dL, total protein 5.0, and albumin 1.9. The hematocrit was 33.9, white count 7.6, and platelets 405. A morning cortisol was 19.5, with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 1.7. The patient was treated with 1 μg of intravenous DDAVP, along with 75 mL/h of intravenous half-normal saline. After the plasma Na+ concentration dropped to 116 meq/L, intravenous fluid was switched to normal saline at the same infusion rate. The subsequent results are shown in Table 64e-1.

This patient presented with hypovolemic hyponatremia and a “prerenal” reduction in GFR, with an increase in serum creatinine. She had experienced diarrhea for some time and manifested an orthostatic tachycardia after a liter of normal saline. As expected for hypovolemic hyponatremia, the urine Na+ concentration was <20 meq/L in the absence of congestive heart failure or other causes of hypervolemic hyponatremia, and she responded to saline hydration with an increase in plasma Na+ concentration and a decrease in creatinine.

Characteristic lesions of atopic dermatitis are erythematous papules or plaques with ill-defined borders and overlying scale or hyperkeratosis. Lesions can be secondarily excoriated or have an overlying crust that is yellow or hemorrhagic. Weeping may be present in acute stages. Lichenification is found in older lesions. Formation of fissures is common in both acute and chronic lesions. Temporary hypoand hyperpigmentation can be seen after lesions resolve, but atopic dermatitis is not usually scarring unless secondary features become severe (e.g., infection or physical manipulation [scratching]).

Characteristic locations vary with the age of the patient. Infantile atopic dermatitis typically affects the face and extensor surfaces of the extremities and is often generalized. Childhood lesions predominate in flexural surfaces (antecubital and popliteal fossae), wrists, ankles, hands, and feet (Fig. 190-1).The adult phase occurs after puberty and manifests in the flexural areas including the neck, as well as predominant involvement on the face, dorsa of the hands, fingers and toes, and the upper arms and back.

Secondary bacterial infection, most commonly with Staphylococcus aureus or less commonly with Streptococcus pyogenes, is frequently present. Patients are at increased riskfor infections with cutaneous viruses and can develop disseminated skin infections with viruses such as herpes simplexvirus (eczema herpeticum), varicella-zoster virus, smallpoxvirus (eczema vaccinatum), and molluscum contagiosum.Atopic skin is more susceptible to fungal infections as well.

Patients with HIV/AIDS can develop severe seborrheic dermatitis or an overlapping syndrome of severe seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and even Reiter’s syndrome.

Diagnosed by clinical impression. Rule out contact dermatitis and psoriasis.

Treatment consists of selenium sulfide or zinc pyrithione shampoos for the scalp, and topical antifungals and/or topical corticosteroids for other areas. Low-concentration coal tar shampoos are still available despite concerns about carcinogenicity.

A T-cell-mediated inﬂammatory dermatosis characterized by erythematous patches and silvery scales due to dermal inﬂammation and epidermal hyperplasia. Five percent of patients also have a seronegative arthritis. The condition usually starts in puberty or young adulthood, and its incidence is 2–4%.

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing skin disorder that tends to be more severe and prominent in young children. Symptoms become less severe in two thirds of children, with complete remission for approximately 20%. Early onset disease that is more widespread, concomitant asthma and allergic rhinitis, family history of atopic dermatitis, and elevated serum IgE levels may predict a more persistent course. Patients and families should be taught that a single cause and cure for atopic dermatitis is unlikely but that good control is possible for the majority of affected patients.

An important step in the management of atopic dermatitis is to identify and avoid allergens and irritants. Common irritants include soaps, detergents, fragrances, chemicals, smoke, and extremes of temperature and humidity. Wool and synthetic fabrics can be irritating to the skin; 100% cotton fabric is preferred. Sweating is a recognized trigger. Fingernails should be trimmed frequently to minimize excoriations from scratching.

In infants and younger children who do not respond to the usual therapies, identifying and removing a food allergen from the diet may lead to clinical improvement. Food allergy is not a common trigger for older patients. Other environmental exposures, such as dust mites, pet dander, or pollens, can also contribute to the disease state.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common malignancy, found in 75% of thyroid cancers. For unclear reasons the incidence of papillary cancer increased by almost threefold in the past 30 years, from 2.7 to 7.7 per 100,000 people (55). This may represent the more ready diagnosis of smaller cancers. The majority of cancers are found incidentally during routine examinations. Risk factors include a history of radiation exposure during childhood and family history. Signs include rapid growth of neck mass, new onset hoarseness, or vocal cord paralysis. In the setting of rapid growth, fixed nodule, new onset hoarseness, or the presence of lymphadenopathy, it is important to be sure a fine-needle aspiration is done. Thyroidectomy is the primary treatment with radioactive iodine and TSH suppression with thyroxine. Patients younger than 50 years of age with a primary tumor of less than 4 cm at presentation, even with associated cervical lymph node metastasis, are usually cured. In the elderly, anaplastic tumors have a poor prognosis and progress rapidly despite therapy.

Follicular thyroid cancer is the second most common thyroid cancer, comprising up to 10% of cases. These tend to occur in an older population with peak ages of 40 to 60. It has a threefold greater prevalence in women than men. This form of cancer tends to have vascular invasion, frequently with distant metastases. The prognosis tends to be less favorable with this form of cancer than with papillary cancers, although women do have a better prognosis than men.

Thyroid tumors range from circumscribed, benign adenomas to highly aggressive, anaplastic carcinomas. From a clinical standpoint, the possibility of a tumor is of major concern in patients who present with thyroid nodules. Fortunately, the overwhelming majority of solitary nodules of the thyroid prove to be either benign adenomas or localized, non-neoplastic conditions (e.g., a dominant nodule in multinodular goiter, simple cysts, or foci of thyroiditis). Carcinomas of the thyroid, by contrast, are uncommon, accounting for less than 1% of solitary thyroid nodules. Several clinical criteria provide a clue to the nature of a given thyroid nodule:

Solitary nodules, in general, are more likely to be neoplastic than are multiple nodules.

Nodules in very young (<20 years) or very old (>70 years) individuals are more likely to be neoplastic.

Nodules in males are more likely to be neoplastic than are those in females.

A history of radiation exposure is associated with an increased incidence of thyroid malignancy.

Nodules that take up radioactive iodine in imaging studies (hot nodules) are more likely to be benign.

Such associations, however, are of little significance in the evaluation of a given patient, in whom the timely recognition of a malignancy may be lifesaving. Ultimately, morphologic evaluation of a thyroid nodule by fine-needle aspiration, combined with the histologic study of surgically resected thyroid tissue, provide the most definitive information about the nature of the nodule.

Biopsy of nonpalpable lesions is a potentially difficult procedure that requires close cooperation between the surgeon and radiologist. Using ultrasonographic, mammographic, or MRI guidance, a needle or specialized wire is placed into the breast parenchyma at or near the site of the suspected abnormality. Some mammographers will inject a biologic dye into the breast parenchyma to assist localization. The surgeon reviews the films and localizes the abnormality with respect to the tip of the wire or needle. Alternatively, the surgeon will perform ultrasonography intraoperatively to directly localize the lesion. An incision is made directly over the abnormality, and a small portion of the breast tissue suspected of containing the abnormality is excised. For mammographically detected lesions, a specimen radiograph is obtained to ensure that the abnormality has been recovered. Often, the radiologist can place a needle in the specimen at the site of the abnormality to facilitate histologic evaluation and ensure that the pathologist examines the site of the abnormality. Image-guided biopsy should be performed only for lesions inaccessible to needle biopsy or those lesions that may be associated with malignancy such as ADH.

Breast cancer may arise in the intermediate-size ducts, terminal ducts, or lobules. In most cases, the diagnosis of lobular and intraductal carcinoma is based more on histologic appearance than site of origin. The cancer may be either in situ (ductal carcinoma in situ or lobular carcinoma in situ) or invasive (infiltrating ductal carcinoma, infiltrating lobular carcinoma). Morphologic subtypes of infiltrating ductal carcinoma include scirrhous, tubular, medullary, and mucinous carcinoma.

Carcinoma of the thyroid is rare in children (1% of all pediatric cancers in the 5to 9-year-old age group and up to 7% of cancers in the 15to 19-year-old age group). Papillary and follicular carcinomas represent 90% of childhood thyroid cancers. A history of therapeutic head or neck irradiation or radiation exposure from nuclear accidents predisposes a child to thyroid cancer. Carcinoma usually presents as a firm to hard, painless nonfunctional solitary nodule and may spread to adjacent lymph nodes. Rapid growth, hoarseness (recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement), and lung metastasis may be present. If the nodule is solid on ultrasound, is cold on radioiodine scanning, and feels hard, the likelihood of a carcinoma is high. Excisional biopsy usually is performed, but FNA biopsy also may be diagnostic.

Treatment includes total thyroidectomy, selective regional node dissection, and radioablation with 131I for residual or recurrent disease. The prognosis is usually good if the disease is diagnosed early.

Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid may be asymptomatic except for a mass. Diagnosis is based on the presenceof elevated calcitonin levels, either in the basal state or after pentagastrin stimulation (difficult to obtain) and histologicexamination. This tumor most often occurs with multipleendocrine neoplasia 2a or 2b (MEN), possibly in a familial pattern. In some families, the presence of mutations ofthe RET proto-oncogene is predictive of the development of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. The location of the mutation can help determine when removal of the thyroid iswarranted. Genetic screening of other members of the family is indicated after a proband is recognized. Prophylacticthyroidectomy is indicated for the family members with thesame allele.

Light entering the eye is focused by the cornea and then the biconvex lens onto the outer layer of the retina. The cornea, fluid of the anterior chamber, lens, vitreous, and retina itself must be transparent. The clarity of these media can be determined ophthalmoscopically, and a complete examination requires that the pupil be dilated to at least 6 mm in diameter. This is accomplished by instilling two drops of 2.5 percent phenylephrine and/or 0.5 to 1.0 percent tropicamide in each eye after the visual acuity has been measured, the pupillary response is recorded, and the intraocular pressure is estimated. In elderly persons, lower concentrations of these mydriatics should be used. The mydriatic action of phenylephrine lasts for 3 to 6 h. Rarely, an attack of angle-closure glaucoma (manifesting itself by diminished vision, ocular pain, nausea, and vomiting) may be precipitated by pharmacologic pupillary dilatation; this requires the administration of pilocarpine to the eye and the immediate attention of an ophthalmologist. It is advisable to have access to pilocarpine if the pupils are to be dilated.

By looking through a high-plus lens of the direct ophthalmoscope from a distance of 6 to 12 in, the examiner can visualize opacities in the refractive media; by adjusting the lenses from a high-plus to a zero or minus setting, it is possible to “depth-focus” from the cornea to the retina. Depending on the refractive error of the examiner, lenticular opacities are best seen within the range of +20 to +12. The retina comes into focus with +1 to -1 lenses. The illuminated pupil appears as a red circular structure (red reflex), the color being provided by blood in the capillaries of the choroid layer. The main limit of direct ophthalmoscopy is its inability to visualize lesions in the retina that lie anterior to the equator of the globe; these are seen only by the indirect method.

Dx: A diagnosis of exclusion. Be particularly aware of giant cell arteritis in patients > 50 years of age with new headaches; always obtain an ESR even if headaches are mild and unassociated with constitutional or vascular symptoms. There are no focal neurologic signs.

Tx: Relaxation, massage, hot baths, and avoidance of exacerbating factors. NSAIDs and acetaminophen are first-line abortive therapy, but trip-tans may also be considered.

The usual etiology involves a suppurative process of the orbit, nasal sinuses, or central face that leads to septic thrombosis of the cavernous sinus. Non-septic thrombosis is rare; S. aureus is the most common causative agent. The syndrome can also be seen with nonbacterial agents, particularly fungi (Mucor or Aspergillus species). Current antibiotics have greatly ↓ both incidence and mortality.

Headache is the most common presenting symptom.

Patients may present with orbital pain, edema, diplopia (2° to oculomotor, abducens, or trochlear nerve involvement), or visual disturbances and may describe a recent history of sinusitis or facial infection. On exam, they typically appear ill and have a fever.

If a 25-year-old male wakes up repeatedly during the night with unilateral periorbital pain associated with ipsilateral lacrimation, think cluster headache.

If a 30-year-old female complains of headaches at the end of the day that worsen with stress and improve with relaxation or massage, think tension-type headache.

Tension-type headaches are the most common type of headache diagnosed in adults.

Additional signs may include red eye, proptosis, ptosis, or ophthalmoplegia of the affected eye (partial or complete). Diminished pupillary constriction (CN III) and/or dilation (Horner’s) may also be present.

Changes in mental status such as confusion, drowsiness, or coma suggest spread to the CNS or sepsis. Late findings include meningismus or systemic signs of sepsis.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Early Infection: Stage 1 (Localized Infection) Because of the small size of nymphal ixodid ticks, most patients do not remember the preceding tick bite. After an incubation period of 3–32 days, EM usually begins as a red macule or papule at the site of the tick bite that expands slowly to form a large annular lesion (Fig. 210-1). As the lesion increases in size, it often develops a bright red outer border and partial central clearing. The center of the lesion sometimes becomes intensely erythematous and indurated, vesicular, or necrotic. In other instances, the expanding lesion remains an even, intense red; several red rings are found within an outside ring; or the central area turns blue before the lesion clears. Although EM can be located anywhere, the thigh, groin, and axilla are particularly common sites. The lesion is warm but not often painful. Approximately 20% of patients do not exhibit this characteristic skin manifestation.

FIGuRE 210-1 A classic erythema migrans lesion (9 cm in diameter) is shown near the right axilla. The lesion has partial central clearing, a bright red outer border, and a target center. (Courtesy of Vijay K. Sikand, MD; with permission.)

Early Infection: Stage 2 (Disseminated Infection) In cases in the United States, B. burgdorferi often spreads hematogenously to many sites within days or weeks after the onset of EM. In these cases, patients may develop secondary annular skin lesions similar in appearance to the initial lesion. Skin involvement is commonly accompanied by severe headache, mild stiffness of the neck, fever, chills, migratory musculoskeletal pain, arthralgias, and profound malaise and fatigue. Less common manifestations include generalized lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, hepatitis, sore throat, nonproductive cough, conjunctivitis, iritis, or testicular swelling. Except for fatigue and lethargy, which are often constant, the early signs and symptoms of Lyme disease are typically intermittent and changing. Even in untreated patients, the early symptoms usually become less severe or disappear within several weeks. In ~15% of patients, the infection presents with these nonspecific systemic symptoms.

This type of inflammatory disease of cranial arteries is an important cause of headache in older persons. All of our patients have been older than 55 years of age, most of them older than age 65. From a state of normal health, the patient develops an increasingly intense throbbing or nonthrobbing headache, often with superimposed sharp, stabbing pains. In a few patients the headache has had an almost explosive onset. The pain is usually unilateral, sometimes bilateral, and often localized to the site of the affected arteries in the scalp. The pain persists to some degree throughout the day and is particularly severe at night. It lasts for many months if untreated. The superficial temporal and other scalp arteries are frequently thickened and tender and without pulsation. Jaw claudication and ischemic nodules on the scalp, with ulceration of the overlying skin, have been described in severe cases.

Many of the patients feel generally unwell and have lost weight; some have a low-grade fever and anemia. Usually the sedimentation rate is greatly elevated (>50 mm/h and typically >75 mm/h) but elevation of the C-reactive protein (CRP) level is a more sensitive indicator of this inflammatory condition and is particularly helpful when the sedimentation rate is only mildly elevated. A few patients have a peripheral neutrophilic leukocytosis. Half of patients have generalized aching of proximal limb muscles, reflecting the presence of polymyalgia rheumatica (see Chap. 45, “Polymyalgia Rheumatica”). A relation of temporal arteritis to herpes zoster has been proposed.

The importance of early diagnosis relates to the threat of blindness from thrombosis of the ophthalmic or posterior ciliary arteries. This may be preceded by several episodes of amaurosis fugax (transient monocular blindness). Ophthalmoplegia may also occur but is less frequent, and its cause, whether neural or muscular, is not settled.

Duplicated Renal Collecting System. In this anatomical anomaly, the upper and lower poles of the kidney-called moieties-are each drained b) a separate ureter (Fig. 10-42). Duplication is found in approximately 1 in 4000 pregnancies, is more common in females, and is bilateral in 15 to 20 percent of cases (James, 1998; Vergani, 1998; Whitten, 2001). Sonographically, an intervening tissue band separates two distinct renal pelves. Development of hydronephrosis or ureteral dilatation may occur due to abnormal implantation of one or both ureters within the bladder-a relationship that reflects the anatomical Weigert-Meyer rule. The upper pole ureter may develop obstruction from a ureterocele within the bladder, whereas the lower pole ureter has a shortened intravesical segment that predisposes to vesicoureteral reflux (see Fig. 10-42B). Thus, both moieties may become dilated from diferent etiologies, and both are at risk for loss of function.

The prevalence of bilateral renal agenesis is approximately in 8000 births, whereas that of unilateral renal agenesis is 1 in

When a kidney is absent, color Doppler imaging of the descending aorta demonstrates absence of the ipsilateral renal artery (Fig. 10-43). In addition, the ipsilateral adrenal gland typically enlarges to ill the renal fossa, termed the ying down adrenal sin (Hofman, 1992). As with other fetal anomalies, amniocentesis for chromosomal microarray analysis should be considered.

Bilateral complete obstruction produces anuria. When the obstruction is distal to the bladder, the dominant symptoms are those of bladder distention. Paradoxically, incomplete bilateral obstruction causes polyuria rather than oliguria as a result of defects in tubular concentrating mechanisms, and this may obscure the true nature of the lesion. Unilateral hydronephrosis may remain completely silent for long periods unless the other kidney also is dysfunctional. Often the enlarged kidney is discovered on routine physical examination. Sometimes the underlying cause of the hydronephrosis, such as renal calculi or an obstructing tumor, produces symptoms that uncover the hydronephrosis. Removal of obstruction usually permits full return of function within a few weeks; however, with time the changes become irreversible.

Congenital and developmental abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract represent the most common cause of end-stage renal disease in individuals younger than 21 years of age and account for 40% to 50% of pediatric renal failure worldwide. The abnormalities can affect the kidney (e.g., dysplasia, agenesis, and hypoplasia), collecting system (e.g., duplicated collecting system, hydronephrosis, and megaureter), bladder (e.g., ureterocele and vesicoureteral reflux), or urethra (e.g., posterior urethral valves). They may present as an isolated feature or as part of a syndrome in association with extrarenal manifestations. Most result from sporadic developmental defects of unknown cause. Others are caused by germline mutations in genes that impact the development of the kidney and especially the ureteric bud. The spectrum of clinical presentations is broad depending on the nature and severity of the underlying abnormalities. We restrict the discussion to a few forms affecting the kidney.

Lateral to the urogenital folds, another pair of swellings develops, known in the indifferent stage as labioscrotal swellings. In the absence of androgens, they remain largely unfused to become the labia majora. The definitive urogenital sinus gives rise to the vaginal vestibule, into which open the urethra, vagina, and greater vestibular glands.

Clinical Correlations Developmental abnormalities of the urinary and genital systems can be explained and understood by a consideration of female and male embryologic development. Because of the intertwined development of these two systems, abnormalities in one may be associated with abnormalities in the other (25).

Urinary-tract anomalies arise from defects in the ureteric bud, the metanephric blastema, or their inductive interaction with each other.

Renal Agenesis Renal agenesis occurs when one or both ureteric buds fail to form or degenerate, and the metanephric blastema is therefore not induced to differentiate into nephrons. Bilateral renal agenesis is incompatible with postnatal survival, but infants with only one kidney usually survive, and the single kidney undergoes compensatory hypertrophy. Unilateral renal agenesis is often associated with absence or abnormality of fallopian tubes, uterus, or vagina—the paramesonephric duct derivatives.

Abnormalities of Renal Position Abnormalities of renal position result from disturbance in the normal ascent of the kidneys. A malrotated pelvic kidney is the most common result; a horseshoe kidney, in which the kidneys are fused across the midline, occurs in about 1 in 600 individuals and has a final position lower than usual because its normal ascent is prevented by the root of the inferior mesenteric artery.

document (3) 

If renal agenesis is bilateral, no urine is produced, and the resulting anhydramnios leads to pulmonary hypoplasia, limb contractures, and a distinctively compressed face. When this combination results from renal agenesis, it is called Poter syndrome, after Dr. Edith Potter, who described it in 1946. When these abnormalities result from severely decreased amnionic luid volume from another etiology, such as bilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney or autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, it is called Poter sequence. he prognosis for these abnormalities is extremely poor.

This severe form of renal dysplasia results in a nonfunctioning kidney. The nephrons and collecting ducts do not form normally, such that primitive ducts are surrounded by ibromuscular tissue, and the ureter is atretic (Hains, 2009). Sonographically, the kidney contains numerous smooth-walled cysts of varying size that do not communicate with the renal pelvis and are surrounded by echogenic cortex (Fig. 10-44).

Unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) has a prevalence of 1 in 4000 births. Contralateral renal abnormalities are present in 30 to 40 percent-most frequently vesicoureteral relux or ureteropelvic junction obstruction (Schreuder, 2009). Nonrenal anomalies have been reported in 25 percent of cases, and cystic dysplasia may occur as a component of many genetic syndromes (Lazebnik, 1999; Schreuder, 2009). If MCDK is isolated and unilateral, the prognosis is generally good.

In patients with cystic fibrosis, the high concentration of macromolecules can block the pancreatic ducts. It must be appreciated, however, that there is a great deal of heterogeneity in relationship to the CFTR gene defect. More than 1000 putative mutations of the CFTR gene have been identified. Attempts to elucidate the relationship between the genotype and pancreatic manifestations have been hampered by the number of mutations. The ability to detect CFTR mutations has led to the

In most vertebrate cells, an ABC transporter in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (named transporter associated with antigen processing, or TAP transporter) actively pumps a wide variety of peptides from the cytosol into the ER lumen. These peptides are produced by protein degradation in proteasomes (discussed in Chapter 6). They are carried from the ER to the cell surface, where they are displayed for scrutiny by cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which kill the cell if the peptides are derived from a virus or other microorganism lurking in the cytosol of an infected cell (discussed in Chapter 24).

Yet another member of the ABC transporter family is the cystic fibrosis trans-membrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR), which was discovered through studies of the common genetic disease cystic fibrosis. This disease is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding CFTR, a Cl– transport protein in the plasma membrane of epithelial cells. CFTR regulates ion concentrations in the extracellular fluid, especially in the lung. One in 27 Caucasians carries a gene encoding a mutant form of this protein; in 1 in 2900, both copies of the gene are mutated, causing the disease. In contrast to other ABC transporters, ATP binding and hydrolysis in the CFTR protein do not drive the transport process. Instead, they control the opening and closing of a continuous channel, which provides a passive conduit for Cl– to move down its electrochemical gradient. Thus, some ABC proteins can function as transporters and others as gated channels.

Frameshift mutations: If one or two nucleotides are either deleted from or added to the coding region of an mRNA, a frameshift mutation occurs, altering the reading frame. This can result in a product with a radically different amino acid sequence or a truncated product due to the eventual creation of a termination codon (Fig. 32.5). If three nucleotides are added, a new amino acid is added to the peptide. If three are deleted, an amino acid is lost. Loss of three nucleotides maintains the reading frame but can result in serious pathology. For example, cystic fibrosis (CF), a chronic, progressive, inherited disease that primarily affects the pulmonary and digestive systems, is most commonly caused by deletion of three nucleotides from the coding region of a gene, resulting in the loss of phenylalanine (Phe, or F; see p. 5) at the 508th position (∆F508) in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein encoded by that gene. This ∆F508 mutation prevents normal folding of CFTR, leading to its destruction by the proteasome (see p. 247). CFTR normally functions as a chloride channel in epithelial cells, and its loss results in the production of thick, sticky secretions in the lungs and pancreas, leading to lung damage and digestive deficiencies (see p. 174). The incidence of CF is highest (1 in 3,300) in those of Northern European origin. In >70% of individuals with CF, the ∆F508 mutation is the cause of the disease.

III. COMPONENTS REQUIRED FOR TRANSLATION

A large number of components are required for the synthesis of a protein. These include all the amino acids that are found in the finished product, the mRNA to be translated, transfer RNA (tRNA) for each of the amino acids, functional ribosomes, energy sources, and enzymes as well as noncatalytic protein factors needed for the initiation, elongation, and termination steps of polypeptide chain synthesis.

associated with these mutations. Patients with two CFTR mutations (compound heterozygotes) demonstrated CFTR function at a level between that seen in typical cystic fibrosis and cystic fibrosis carriers and had a 40-fold increased risk of pancreatitis. The presence of an N34S SPINK1 mutation increased the risk 20-fold. A combination of two CFTR mutations and an N34S SPINK1 mutation increased the risk of pancreatitis 900-fold. Knowledge of the genetic defects and downstream alterations in protein expression has led to the development of novel genetic therapy in cystic fibrosis children that potentiates the CFTR channel

Screening Women with an intact cervix should undergo routine cytologic screening. Because VAIN is nearly always accompanied by CIN, the Pap test result is likely to be positive when VAIN is present. The vagina should be carefully inspected by colposcopic examination at the time of colposcopy for any CIN lesion. Particular attention should be paid to the upper vagina. Women who have persistent abnormal Pap tests without evident cervical pathology and those with abnormal cytology after treatment of CIN should be examined carefully for VAIN. For women in whom the cervix was removed for high-grade cervical neoplasia, Pap testing should be performed at regular intervals (e.g., yearly), depending on the diagnosis and severity of lesion.

Figure 19.17 Human papillomavirus (HPV)/vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (VAIN 1). Note the surface spicules with partial uptake of Lugol’s stain.

Diagnosis Colposcopic examination and directed biopsy are the mainstays of diagnosis of VAIN. Typically, the lesions are located along the vaginal ridges, are ovoid in shape and slightly raised, and often have surface spicules. VAIN 1 lesions usually are accompanied by a significant amount of koilocytosis, indicating their HPV origin (Fig. 19.17). VAIN 2 exhibits a thicker acetowhite epithelium, a more raised external border, and less iodine uptake (Fig. 19.18A). When VAIN 3 occurs, the surface may become papillary, and the vascular patterns of punctation and mosaic may occur (Fig. 19.18B). Early invasion is typified by vascular patterns similar to those of the cervix.

The primary method used for cancer screening is cervical cytology via Pap smear. The guidelines of the American Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology recommend initiation of cervical cancer screening at age 21, regardless of the age of sexual debut. Women 21–29 years old with a normal Pap smear should have the test repeated every 3 years. Although adolescent and young women often test positive for HPV DNA, they are at very low risk of cervical cancer. Co-testing, or testing for HPV DNA at the time of the Pap smear, is not recommended for women in this age group because the presence of HPV DNA does not correlate with the presence of high-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia. Women 30–65 years of age should have a Pap smear every 3 years if testing for HPV DNA is not performed. The screening interval for women in this age group can be extended to every 5 years if co-testing results are negative. HPV testing is not recommended for partners of women with HPV or for screening for conditions other than cervical cancer.

Currently, there is no clear consensus regarding screening for anal cancer and its precursors, including high-grade anal intraepithelial lesions. This lack of clarity is due to an inadequate understanding of optimal treatment for lowor high-grade anal dysplasia found during cytologic screening. The current HIV treatment guidelines suggest that there may be a benefit to screening, but an effect on the associated morbidity and mortality of anal squamous cell cancer has not been consistently demonstrated.

A variety of treatment modalities are available for various HPV infections, but none has been proven to eliminate HPV from tissue adjacent to the destroyed and infected tissue. Treatment efficacies are limited by frequent recurrences (presumably due to reinfection acquired from an infected partner), reactivation of latent virus, or autoinoculation from nearby infected cells. The goals of treatment include prevention of virus transmission, eradication of premalignant lesions, and reduction of symptoms.

Treatment is generally successful in eliminating visible lesions and grossly diseased tissue. Different therapies are indicated for genital warts, vaginal and cervical disease, and perianal and anal disease.

Treatment with insulin becomes necessary as type 2 DM enters the phase of relative insulin deficiency (as seen in long-standing DM) and is signaled by inadequate glycemic control with one or two oral glucose-lowering agents. Insulin alone or in combination should be used in patients who fail to reach the glycemic target. For example, a single dose of long-acting insulin at bedtime is often effective in combination with metformin. In contrast, insulin secretagogues have little utility once insulin therapy is started.

Eye Infections HSV infection of the eye is the most common cause of corneal blindness in the United States. HSV keratitis presents as an acute onset of pain, blurred vision, chemosis, conjunctivitis, and characteristic dendritic lesions of the cornea. Use of topical glucocorticoids may exacerbate symptoms and lead to involvement of deep structures of the eye. Debridement, topical antiviral treatment, and/or IFN therapy hastens healing. However, recurrences are common, and the deeper structures of the eye may sustain immunopathologic injury. Stromal keratitis due to HSV appears to be related to T cell–dependent destruction of deep corneal tissue. An HSV-1 epitope that is autoreactive with T cell–targeting corneal antigens has been postulated to be a factor in this infection. Chorioretinitis, usually a manifestation of disseminated HSV infection, may occur in neonates or in patients with HIV infection. HSV and VZV can cause acute necrotizing retinitis as an uncommon but severe manifestation.

Central and Peripheral Nervous System Infections HSV accounts for 10–20% of all cases of sporadic viral encephalitis in the United States. The estimated incidence is ~2.3 cases per 1 million persons per year. Cases are distributed throughout the year, and the age distribution appears to be biphasic, with peaks at 5–30 and >50 years of age. HSV-1 causes >95% of cases.

Rather, it changes the location of stem cells by indirect means, altering molecules such as CXCL12 that tether stem cells to their niche. Molecules shown to be important for altering the proliferation, self-renewal, or survival of stem cells, such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, transcription factors like Bmi-1, or microRNA-processing enzymes like Dicer, have little or different effects on progenitor cells.

FIGURE 89e-2 Hierarchy of hematopoietic differentiation. Stem cells are multipotent cells that are the source of all descendant cells and have the capacity to provide either long-term (measured in years) or short-term (measured in months) cell production. Progenitor cells have a more limited spectrum of cells they can produce and are generally a short-lived, highly proliferative population also known as transient amplifying cells. Precursor cells are cells committed to a single blood cell lineage but with a continued ability to proliferate; they do not have all the features of a fully mature cell. Mature cells are the terminally differentiated product of the differentiation process and are the effector cells of specific activities of the blood and immune system. Progress through the pathways is mediated by alterations in gene expression. The regulation of the differentiation by soluble factors and cell-cell communications within the bone marrow niche are still being defined. The transcription factors that characterize particular cell transitions are illustrated on the arrows; the soluble factors that contribute to the differentiation process are in blue. This picture is a simplification of the process. Active research is revealing multiple discrete cell types in the maturation of B cells and T cells and has identified cells that are biased toward one lineage or another (rather than uncommitted) in their differentiation.

cells. The process may be controlled by particularly high levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors like p57 or CDKN1c that restrict entry of stem cells into the cell cycle, blocking the G1-S transition. Exogenous signals from the niche also appear to enforce quiescence, including the activation of the tyrosine kinase receptor Tie2 on stem cells by angiopoietin 1 on niche cells.

ES Cell Regulation It is important to identify genes involved in the regulation of stem cell function and to examine the effects of altered gene expression on ES and other stem cells. For example, core networks of TFs such as Pou5f1 (Oct4), Nanog, and Sox2, govern key gene regulatory pathways/networks for the maintenance of self-renewal and pluripotency of mouse and human ES cells. These TF networks are modulated by specific external factors through signal transduction pathways, such as leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif)/Stat3, mitogenactivated protein kinase 1/3 (Mapk1/3), the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) superfamily, and Wnt/glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (Gsk3b). Inhibitors of Mapk1/3 and Gsk3b signaling enhance the derivation of ES cells and help maintain ES cells in full pluripotency (“ground” or “naive state”). Recent data also indicate that 20–25 nucleotide RNAs, called microRNAs (miRNAs), play an important role in regulating stem cell function by repressing the translation of their target genes. For example, it has been shown that miR-21 regulates cell cycle progression in ES cells and miR-128 prevents the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. These types of analyses should provide molecular clues about the function of stem cells and lead to a more effective means to manipulate stem cells for future therapeutic use.

Among the recently isolated and most completely characterized factors are several that stimulate granulocyte and monocyte formation, GM-CSF, G-CSF, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). Interleukins, produced by lymphocytes, act on other leukocytes and their progenitors. IL-3 is a cytokine that appears to affect most progenitor cells and even terminally differentiated cells. Any particular cytokine may act at one or more stages in hemopoiesis, affecting cell division, differentiation, or cell function.

identifying the various intracellular transcription factors, recent studies have identified and begun to characterize numerous signaling molecules found in the bone marrow. These include glycoproteins that act as both circulating hormones and local mediators to regulate the progress of hemopoiesis and the rate of differentiation of other cell types (Table 10.4). Specific hormones such as erythropoietin or thrombopoietin, discussed in a previous section, regulate erythrocyte and thrombocyte development, respectively. Other factors, collectively called colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), are subclassified according to the specific cell or group of cells that they affect. Among the

poorly understood. Clearly, negative feedback mechanisms affect the level of production of most of the cells, leading to the normal tightly regulated blood cell counts. However, many of the regulatory mechanisms that govern production of more mature progenitor cells do not apply or apply differently to stem cells. Similarly, most of the molecules shown to be able to change the size of the stem cell pool have little effect on more mature blood cells. For example, the growth factor erythropoietin, which stimulates red blood cell production from more mature precursor cells, has no effect on stem cells. Similarly,

Intimate interactions between HSCs and their bone marrow microenvironment work toward redefining the identity and the differentiation pathways of these multipotential stem cells. Signaling molecules from a variety of bone marrow cells initiate intracellular pathways that ultimately target a select group of synergistic and inhibitory proteins known as transcription factors. They specifically bind to promoter or enhancer regions on DNA in the affected cell. By controlling transcription of the specific genes downstream, these transcription factors trigger a cascade of genetic changes that ultimately determines the course of the cells during differentiation.

exclude signs and symptoms associated with lymphoma (e.g., fever and night sweats). A complete physical examination, with particular attention to all nodal basins and with a testicular examination in men, is critically important. Laboratory assessment can be helpful; elevated lactate dehy-drogenase levels may suggest lymphoma, and elevated β-human chorionic gonadotropin levels or α-fetoprotein levels may indi-cate a germ cell tumor.Figure 36-9. A 50-year-old man with a large right dedifferentiated liposarcoma.

Lymphadenitis caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria usually is unilateral in the cervical, submandibular, or preauricular nodes and is more common in toddlers. The nodes are relatively painless and firm initially, but gradually soften, rupture, and drain over time. The local reaction is circumscribed, and overlying skin may develop a violaceous discoloration without warmth. Fever and systemic symptoms are minimal or absent.

Initial laboratory tests of regional lymphadenopathy include a complete blood count and inflammatory markers. Infectious mononucleosis is characterized by lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes; thrombocytopenia and elevated hepatic enzymes are common.

Cultures of infected skin lesions and tonsillar exudates should be obtained. Isolation of group A streptococci from the oropharynx suggests, but does not confirm, streptococcal cervical lymphadenitis. A blood culture should be obtained from children with systemic signs and symptoms of bacteremia.

Serologic testing for EBV and for B. henselae should be obtained if there are appropriate findings. The most reliable test for diagnosis of acute EBV infection is the IgM antiviral capsid antigen (Fig. 99-1). Heterophil antibody is also diagnostic but is not reliably positive in children younger than 4 years with infectious mononucleosis.

Extended diagnostic workup for lymphadenopathy is guided by the specific risk factors in the history and physical examination findings. Chest radiograph, throat culture, antistreptolysin O titer, and serologic tests for CMV, toxoplasmosis, syphilis, tularemia, Brucella, histoplasmosis, and coccidioidomycosis may be indicated. Genital tract evaluation and specimens should be obtained with regional inguinal lymphadenopathy (see Chapter 116). Screening for tuberculosis can be performed using the standard tuberculin skin test or an interferon gamma release assay; both may be positive with atypical mycobacterial infection.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Early Infection: Stage 1 (Localized Infection) Because of the small size of nymphal ixodid ticks, most patients do not remember the preceding tick bite. After an incubation period of 3–32 days, EM usually begins as a red macule or papule at the site of the tick bite that expands slowly to form a large annular lesion (Fig. 210-1). As the lesion increases in size, it often develops a bright red outer border and partial central clearing. The center of the lesion sometimes becomes intensely erythematous and indurated, vesicular, or necrotic. In other instances, the expanding lesion remains an even, intense red; several red rings are found within an outside ring; or the central area turns blue before the lesion clears. Although EM can be located anywhere, the thigh, groin, and axilla are particularly common sites. The lesion is warm but not often painful. Approximately 20% of patients do not exhibit this characteristic skin manifestation.

FIGuRE 210-1 A classic erythema migrans lesion (9 cm in diameter) is shown near the right axilla. The lesion has partial central clearing, a bright red outer border, and a target center. (Courtesy of Vijay K. Sikand, MD; with permission.)

Early Infection: Stage 2 (Disseminated Infection) In cases in the United States, B. burgdorferi often spreads hematogenously to many sites within days or weeks after the onset of EM. In these cases, patients may develop secondary annular skin lesions similar in appearance to the initial lesion. Skin involvement is commonly accompanied by severe headache, mild stiffness of the neck, fever, chills, migratory musculoskeletal pain, arthralgias, and profound malaise and fatigue. Less common manifestations include generalized lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, hepatitis, sore throat, nonproductive cough, conjunctivitis, iritis, or testicular swelling. Except for fatigue and lethargy, which are often constant, the early signs and symptoms of Lyme disease are typically intermittent and changing. Even in untreated patients, the early symptoms usually become less severe or disappear within several weeks. In ~15% of patients, the infection presents with these nonspecific systemic symptoms.

ulceroglandular/Glandular Tularemia These two forms of tularemia account for ~75–85% of cases. The predominant form in children involves cervical or posterior auricular lymphadenopathy and is usually related to tick bites on the head and neck. In adults, the most common form is inguinal/femoral lymphadenopathy resulting from insect and tick exposures on the lower limbs. In cases related to wild game, the usual portal of entry for F. tularensis is either an injury sustained while skinning or cleaning an animal carcass or a bite (usually on the hand). Epitrochlear lymphadenopathy/lymphadenitis is common in patients with bite-related injuries.

In ulceroglandular tularemia, the ulcer is erythematous, indurated, and nonhealing, with a punched-out appearance that lasts 1–3 weeks. The papule may begin as an erythematous lesion that is tender or pruritic; it evolves over several days into an ulcer with sharply demarcated edges and a yellow exudate. The ulcer gradually develops a black base, and simultaneously the regional lymph nodes become tender and severely enlarged (Fig. 195-1). The affected lymph nodes may become fluctuant and drain spontaneously, but the condition usually resolves with effective treatment. Late suppuration of lymph nodes has been described in up to 25% of patients with ulceroglandular/glandular tularemia. Examination of material taken from these late fluctuant nodes after successful antimicrobial treatment reveals sterile necrotic tissue. In 5–10% of patients, the skin lesion may be inapparent, with lymphadenopathy plus systemic signs and symptoms the only physical findings (glandular tularemia). Conversely, a tick or deerfly bite on the trunk may result in an ulcer without evident lymphadenopathy.

Oculoglandular Tularemia In ~1% of patients, the portal of entry for

F. tularensis is the conjunctiva, which the organism usually reaches through contact with contaminated fingers. The inflamed conjunctiva is painful, with numerous yellowish nodules and pinpoint ulcers.

2023-11-29 14:10:58,090 query: In order to assess the feasibility and evaluate the outcomes of cerclage wiring as a supportive approach to osteosynthesis in femur fractures, a group of orthopedic surgeons studied 14 patients with primary and periprosthetic fractures of the thigh bone. Parameters such as patient demographic, type of implant, number of wires used, fracture union rate, and potential complications were thoroughly recorded and analyzed in all the patients, with a mean duration of patient follow-up of 16 months. Union was achieved in all patients with a mean duration of 90 days, and there were no complications found in patients included in the study. The authors were satisfied with their findings and, due to the prospective nature of their research, submitted their study to a journal as a cohort study (which they noted in the study title as well). However, the journal editor returned the article, suggesting that it should be submitted as a case series instead. The editor made this suggestion to the authors for which of the following reasons?

As physicians driven by our desire and commitment to provide the best possible care, we have a responsibility to inform our patients of all therapies that can be of benefit, regardless of their system of origin. In practice this is challenging, because there are many unanswered questions in the use of complementary and alternative modalities, and because there is no established standard of care. Each physician, together with his or her patient, needs to form his or her own opinions regarding the appropriate integration of CAM therapies. Many patients will want conclusive evidence of any therapy before using it. Others, assured of the relative safety of a therapy, may require less conclusive evidence. Illustrating this dilemma, in a systematic review of randomized trials regarding CAM approaches to PMS, the authors concluded that “despite some positive findings, the evidence was not compelling for any of these therapies, with most trials suffering from various methodological limitations. On the basis of current evidence, no complementary or alternative therapy can be recommended as a treatment for premenstrual syndrome” (131). Although this concept certainly is appealing in its simplicity, it may not be in the best interest of patients. We need to be consistent in our requirement of evidence, using the same levels of evidence for incorporating interventions from CAM as from conventional approaches. As with many clinical decisions we are forced to make with incomplete data, many factors must be considered. The potential risks and benefits must be weighed carefully, and primum non nocere must certainly be our guide.

In many regards, we are in the most challenging time as it relates to integrating appropriate CAM approaches into the practice of gynecology. As more research is done and as medical schools and residency programs incorporate education about these approaches, the gap between our patients’ desires and our standard practices will decrease as appropriate therapies are seamlessly incorporated and ineffective and fraudulent ones are discarded.

Surgical treatment of lumbar stenosis Decompression of the spinal canal relieves the symptoms of lumbar stenosis in a large proportion of cases, but the results have been inconsistent. Patients must be chosen carefully for surgery, and success is likely if the clinical features conform to the typical syndrome, mainly pain that altered in various positions and at least partially relieved by rest, with definite evidence of root compression by imaging. In perhaps the most careful trial comparing surgery to conservative treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis, pain and overall function at 2 years was several-fold better in those who had operations (Weinstein et al, 2008). However, interpretation was hampered by a large number of patients who crossed over between arms of the study.

Issues pertaining to the methodology of operation, particularly the need for fusion of the lumbar spine to limit mobility are of interest because of their increased cost over simple decompression but also because patients may query the neurologist about these matters. When there is spondylolisthesis and instability of adjacent segments, current opinion appears to favor fusion in order to reduce worsening spondylolisthesis and back pain. In the absence of slippage and instability, there is evidence from one trial that better patient satisfaction is attained with fusion after the second year compared to simple decompression (Ghogawala et al) but another series has shown little difference before that time. There is also concern about the rates of reoperation at the original level or at adjacent levels, which are destabilized by surgery and subject to spondylolisthesis and restenosis. Some cases of advanced lumbar stenosis have “autofused” adjacent segments may not benefit from the more extensive operation.

Epidural glucocorticoid injections have been used for some time as a temporizing treatment for the pain of lumbar stenosis but a randomized trial conducted by Friedly and colleagues found no difference in disability or leg pain 6 weeks after one or two such injections. Nevertheless, the procedure is still widely used and some patients report relief, which is difficult to separate from the natural course of the process. A series of cases of meningitis that resulted from contaminated drug obtained wide attention but is less likely to occur in the future. Various physical therapy maneuvers and exercises may be helpful in the short run but none has been validated in comparison to others.

Randomized controlled trials should be evaluated with an intention-to-treat analysis, which means that all of the people randomized at the initiation of the trial should be accounted for in the analysis with the group to which they were assigned. Unless part of the overall study design, even if a participant stopped participating in the assigned treatment or “crossed over” to another treatment during the study, they should be analyzed with the group to which they were initially assigned. All of these considerations help to minimize bias in the design, implementation, and interpretation of a clinical trial (6).

Observational Studies In cases where the exposure and outcome are not amenable to an experimental design, because the exposure is known or suspected to have harmful effects, observational studies may be used to assess association. Observational studies, including cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies, are analytic studies that take advantage of “natural experiments” in which exposure is not assigned by the investigator; rather, the individuals are assessed by the investigator for a potential exposure of interest (present or absent) and outcomes (present or absent). The timing of the evaluation of the exposure and outcome defines the study type.

Figure 4.2 Schematic of prospective and retrospective cohort study designs.

Cohort Studies Cohort studies often are referred to as longitudinal studies. Cohort studies involve identifying a group of exposed individuals and unexposed individuals and following both groups over time to compare the rate of disease (or outcome) in the groups. Cohort studies may be prospective, meaning that the exposure is identified before outcome, or retrospective, in which the exposure and outcome have already occurred when the study is initiated. Even in a retrospective cohort study, the study is defined by the fact that the cohorts were identified based on the exposure (not the outcome), and individuals should be free of disease (outcome) at the beginning time point for the cohort study (Fig. 4.2).

document (3) 

In a study that includes a survival analysis, the two cohort groups (exposed and nonexposed) begin with a population that is 100% well (or alive) at the beginning of the study. The groups are followed over time to calculate the percentage of the cohort still well (or alive) at different time points during the study and at the end of the study. Although a survival analysis typically describes mortality after disease (i.e., cancer patients who died within 5 years), it can be adapted to other events and outcomes (e.g., the percentage of women who become pregnant while using long-acting contraceptives).

Strengths of cohort studies include the ability to obtain both attributable and relative risks because the occurrence of the outcome is being compared in two groups (see the section on Presenting and Understanding the Results of Analytic Studies). However, only associations can be established, not causality. Because randomization is not part of the study design, the investigator must consider that a factor associated with the exposure may lead to the outcome rather than the exposure itself. Misclassifying the exposure or the outcome and confounding variables are potential sources of bias in cohort studies.

Given that truly prospective cohort studies can be expensive and take a long time for completion, there should be compelling evidence for the public health importance of the exposure(s) and association(s) being addressed. Issues related to sample size and participant retention in the study protocol are as important in cohort studies as they are in randomized controlled trials.

Case-Control Studies A case-control study starts with the identification of individuals with a disease or outcome of interest and a suitable control population without the disease or outcome of interest. The controls should represent a sample of the population from which the cases arose and who were at risk for the disease or outcome but did not develop it. The relationship between a particular attribute or exposure to the disease is retrospectively studied by comparing how the cases and controls differed in that exposure (Fig. 4.3).

A 52-year-old woman visited her family physician with complaints of increasing lethargy and vomiting. The physician examined her and noted that compared to previous visits she had lost significant weight. She was also jaundiced, and on examination of the abdomen a well-defined 10-cm rounded mass was palpable below the liver edge in the right upper quadrant (Fig. 4.185).

The clinical diagnosis was carcinoma of the head of the pancreas.

It is difficult to appreciate how such a precise diagnosis can be made clinically when only three clinical signs have been described.

The patient’s obstruction was in the distal bile duct.

When a patient has jaundice, the causes are excessive breakdown of red blood cells (prehepatic), hepatic failure (hepatic jaundice), and posthepatic causes, which include obstruction along the length of the biliary tree.

The patient had a mass in her right upper quadrant that was palpable below the liver; this was the gallbladder.

In healthy individuals, the gallbladder is not palpable. An expanded gallbladder indicates obstruction either within the cystic duct or below the level of the cystic duct insertion (i.e., the bile duct).

The patient’s vomiting was related to the position of the tumor.

It is not uncommon for vomiting and weight loss (cachexia) to occur in patients with a malignant disease. The head of the pancreas lies within the curve of the duodenum, primarily adjacent to the descending part of the duodenum. Any tumor mass in the region of the head of the pancreas is likely to expand and may encase and invade the duodenum. Unfortunately, in this patient’s case, this happened, producing almost complete obstruction. Further discussion with the patient revealed that she was vomiting relatively undigested food soon after each meal.

A CT scan demonstrated further complications.

A 50-year-old woman was admitted to hospital for surgical resection of the uterus (hysterectomy) for cancer. The surgeon was also going to remove all the pelvic lymph nodes and carry out a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of uterine tubes and ovaries). The patient was prepared for this procedure and underwent routine surgery. Twenty-five hours after surgery, it was noted that the patient had passed no urine and her abdomen was expanding. An ultrasound scan demonstrated a considerable amount of fluid within the abdomen. Fluid withdrawn from the abdomen was tested and found to be urine.

It was postulated that this patient’s ureters had been damaged during the surgery.

The pelvic part of the ureter courses posteroinferiorly and external to the parietal peritoneum on the lateral wall of the pelvis anterior to the internal iliac artery. It continues in its course to a point approximately 2 cm superior to the ischial spine and then passes anteromedially and superior to the levator ani muscles. Importantly, the ureter closely adheres to the peritoneum. The only structure that passes between the ureter and the peritoneum in men is the ductus deferens. In women, however, as the ureter descends on the pelvic wall, it passes under the uterine artery. The ureter continues close to the lateral fornix of the vagina, especially on the left, and enters the posterosuperior angle of the bladder.

It was at this point that the ureter was inadvertently damaged.

Knowing the anatomy and recognizing the possibility of ureteric damage enabled the surgeons to reestablish continuity of the ureter surgically. The patient was hospitalized a few days longer than expected and made an uneventful recovery.

A 25-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with a complaint of pain in her right iliac fossa. The pain had developed rapidly over approximately 40 minutes and was associated with cramps and vomiting. The surgical intern made an initial diagnosis of appendicitis.

document (2) 

Pneumonia can present as right or left upper quadrant abdominal pain.

All female patients with an acute abdomen require a pelvic exam and a pregnancy test to rule out PID, ectopic pregnancy, and ovarian torsion.

McBurney’s point is located one-third of the distance from the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus.

“Hamburger sign”: If a patient wants to eat, consider a diagnosis other than appendicitis. Anorexia is 80% specific for appendicitis.

Psoas sign: Passive extension of the hip leading to RLQ pain.

Obturator sign: Passive internal rotation of the ﬂ exed hip leading to RLQ pain.

Rovsing’s sign: Deep palpation of the LLQ leading to RLQ pain.

In perforated appendix, partial pain relief is possible, but peritoneal signs (e.g., rebound, guarding, hypotension, ↑ WBC count, fever) will ultimately develop.

Children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with retrocecal appendices may have atypical presentations that may result in misdiagnosis and ↑ mortality.

Diagnosed by clinical impression.

Look for fever, mild leukocytosis (11,000–15,000 cells/μL) with left shift, and UA with a few RBCs and/or WBCs.

If the clinical diagnosis is unequivocal, no imaging studies are necessary. Otherwise, studies include the following:

KUB: Fecalith or loss of psoas shadow.

Ultrasound: Enlarged, noncompressible appendix.

CT scan with contrast (95–98% sensitive): Periappendiceal stranding or ﬂuid; enlarged appendix.

The patient should be NPO and should receive IV hydration and antibiotics with anaerobic and gram-coverage.

Immediate open or laparoscopic appendectomy is the definitive treatment. If appendicitis is not found, complete exploration of the abdomen is performed.

C-peptide levels should also be elevated and rule out the unusual case of surreptitious administration of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents because excess endogenous insulin pro-duction leads to excess C-peptide.

Hypoglycemia Philip E. Cryer, Stephen N. Davis Hypoglycemia is most commonly caused by drugs used to treat diabe-tes mellitus or by exposure to other drugs, including alcohol. However, a number of other disorders, including critical organ failure, sepsis and inanition, hormone deficiencies, non-β-cell tumors, insulinoma, 420 and prior gastric surgery, can cause hypoglycemia (Table 420-1). Hypoglycemia is most convincingly documented by Whipple’s triad: (1) symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia, (2) a low plasma glucose concentration measured with a precise method (not a glucose monitor), and (3) relief of symptoms after the plasma glucose level is raised. The lower limit of the fasting plasma glucose concentration is normally ∼70 mg/dL (∼3.9 mmol/L), but lower venous glucose levels occur normally, late after a meal, during pregnancy, and during prolonged fasting (>24 h). Hypoglycemia can cause serious morbidity; if severe and prolonged, it can be fatal. It should be considered in any patient with episodes of confusion, an altered level of consciousness, or a seizure.

Glucose is an obligate metabolic fuel for the brain under physiologic conditions. The brain cannot synthesize glucose or store more than a few minutes’ supply as glycogen and therefore requires a continuous supply of glucose from the arterial circulation. As the arterial plasma glucose concentration falls below the physiologic range, blood-tobrain glucose transport becomes insufficient to support brain energy metabolism and function. However, redundant glucose counterregulatory mechanisms normally prevent or rapidly correct hypoglycemia.

the cause of the hypotension is pursued. Shock in a trauma patient or postoperative patient should be presumed to be due to hemorrhage until proven otherwise. The clinical signs of shock may be evidenced by agitation, cool clammy extremities, tachy-cardia, weak or absent peripheral pulses, and hypotension. Such apparent clinical shock results from at least 25% to 30% loss of the blood volume. However, substantial volumes of blood may be lost before the classic clinical manifestations of shock are evident. Thus, when a patient is significantly tachycardic or hypotensive, this represents both significant blood

document (3) 

Hypoglycemia is suspected in patients with typical symptoms; in the presence of confusion, an altered level of consciousness, or a seizure; or in a clinical setting in which hypoglycemia is known to occur. Blood should be drawn, whenever possible, before the administration of glucose to allow documentation of a low plasma glucose concentration. Convincing documentation of hypoglycemia requires the fulfillment of Whipple’s triad. Thus, the ideal time to measure the plasma glucose level is during a symptomatic episode. A normal glucose level excludes hypoglycemia as the cause of the symptoms. A low glucose level confirms that hypoglycemia is the cause of the symptoms, provided the latter resolve after the glucose level is raised. When the cause of the hypoglycemic episode is obscure, additional measurements—made while the glucose level is low and before treatment—should include plasma insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, and β-hydroxybutyrate levels; also critical are screening for circulating oral hypoglycemic agents and assessment of symptoms before and after the plasma glucose concentration is raised.

When the history suggests prior hypoglycemia and no potential mechanism is apparent, the diagnostic strategy is to evaluate the patient as just described and assess for Whipple’s triad during and after an episode of hypoglycemia. On the other hand, while it cannot be ignored, a distinctly low plasma glucose concentration measured in a patient without corresponding symptoms raises the possibility of an artifact (pseudohypoglycemia).

Brain tumors are discussed in Chap. 118.

(See also Chaps. 39 and 385) Temporal (giant cell) arteritis is an inflammatory disorder of arteries that frequently involves the extra-cranial carotid circulation. It is a common disorder of the elderly; its annual incidence is 77 per 100,000 individuals age 50 and older. The average age of onset is 70 years, and women account for 65% of cases. About half of patients with untreated temporal arteritis develop blindness due to involvement of the ophthalmic artery and its branches; indeed, the ischemic optic neuropathy induced by giant cell arteritis is the major cause of rapidly developing bilateral blindness in patients >60 years. Because treatment with glucocorticoids is effective in preventing this complication, prompt recognition of the disorder is important.

Typical presenting symptoms include headache, polymyalgia rheumatica (Chap. 385), jaw claudication, fever, and weight loss. Headache is the dominant symptom and often appears in association with malaise and muscle aches. Head pain may be unilateral or bilateral and is located temporally in 50% of patients but may involve any and all aspects of the cranium. Pain usually appears gradually over a few hours before peak intensity is reached; occasionally, it is explosive in onset. The quality of pain is only seldom throbbing; it is almost invariably described as dull and boring, with superimposed episodic stabbing pains similar to the sharp pains that appear in migraine. Most patients can recognize that the origin of their head pain is superficial, external to the skull, rather than originating deep within the cranium (the pain site for migraineurs). Scalp tenderness is present, often to a marked degree; brushing the hair or resting the head on a pillow may be impossible because of pain. Headache is usually worse at night and often aggravated by exposure to cold. Additional findings may include reddened, tender nodules or red streaking of the skin overlying the temporal arteries, and tenderness of the temporal or, less commonly, the occipital arteries.

Raskin described a headache syndrome in older patients that shares with cluster headache a nocturnal occurrence (hypnic headache). It also may occur with daytime naps. However, it differs in being bilateral and unaccompanied by lacrimation and rhinorrhea. He has successfully treated a number of his patients with 300 mg of lithium carbonate or 75 mg of sustained-release indomethacin at bedtime. The nosologic position of this hypnic headache syndrome is undetermined.

Despite these considerations, the most hazardous cause of headache in the elderly is temporal (cranial) arteritis with or without polymyalgia rheumatica, as discussed further on.

The most common cause of generalized persistent headache, both in adolescents and adults, is probably mild depression or anxiety in one of its several forms. A small group of older patients has delusional symptoms involving pain and physical distortion of cranial structures. As the psychiatric symptoms subside, the headaches usually disappear. Odd cephalic pains, for example, a sensation of having a nail driven into the head (clavus hystericus), may occur in hysteria or psychosis and raise perplexing problems in diagnosis. The bizarre character of these pains, their persistence in the face of every known therapy, the absence of other signs of disease, and the presence of other manifestations of psychiatric disease provide the basis for correct diagnosis. Older children and adolescents sometimes have peculiar behavioral reactions to headache: screaming, looking dazed, clutching the head with an agonized look. Usually, migraine is the underlying disorder in these cases, the additional manifestations responding to therapeutic support and suggestion.

This type of inflammatory disease of cranial arteries is an important cause of headache in older persons. All of our patients have been older than 55 years of age, most of them older than age 65. From a state of normal health, the patient develops an increasingly intense throbbing or nonthrobbing headache, often with superimposed sharp, stabbing pains. In a few patients the headache has had an almost explosive onset. The pain is usually unilateral, sometimes bilateral, and often localized to the site of the affected arteries in the scalp. The pain persists to some degree throughout the day and is particularly severe at night. It lasts for many months if untreated. The superficial temporal and other scalp arteries are frequently thickened and tender and without pulsation. Jaw claudication and ischemic nodules on the scalp, with ulceration of the overlying skin, have been described in severe cases.

Many of the patients feel generally unwell and have lost weight; some have a low-grade fever and anemia. Usually the sedimentation rate is greatly elevated (>50 mm/h and typically >75 mm/h) but elevation of the C-reactive protein (CRP) level is a more sensitive indicator of this inflammatory condition and is particularly helpful when the sedimentation rate is only mildly elevated. A few patients have a peripheral neutrophilic leukocytosis. Half of patients have generalized aching of proximal limb muscles, reflecting the presence of polymyalgia rheumatica (see Chap. 45, “Polymyalgia Rheumatica”). A relation of temporal arteritis to herpes zoster has been proposed.

The importance of early diagnosis relates to the threat of blindness from thrombosis of the ophthalmic or posterior ciliary arteries. This may be preceded by several episodes of amaurosis fugax (transient monocular blindness). Ophthalmoplegia may also occur but is less frequent, and its cause, whether neural or muscular, is not settled.

Patient risk factors: High-risk patients are > 50 years of age, immunocompromised, or with preexisting malignancy.

If SAH is suspected, obtain a head CT without contrast.

If CT is , LP is mandatory.

Obtain a CBC.

If temporal arteritis is suspected, obtain ESR.

A CT/MRI is needed for suspected SAH, ↑ ICP, or focal neurologic findings. Use CT without contrast to evaluate acute hemorrhage.

Affects females more often than males; may be familial. Associated with vascular and brain neurotransmitter (serotonin) changes. Pain is ultimately linked to trigeminal nucleus activation in the brain stem.

Auras appear to result from a different pathomechanism (electrical spreading depression in the brain, possibly linked to ion channel dysfunction) and may occur with or without the pain of migraine headache. Onset usually occurs by the early 20s.

Triggers include certain foods (e.g., red wine), fasting, stress, menses, OCPs, bright light, and disruptions in normal sleep patterns.

Hx/PE:

Presents with a throbbing headache (> 2 hours but usually < 24 hours, and almost always < 72 hours in duration) that is associated with nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and noise sensitivity. Headache is usually relieved by sleep and darkness.

Classic migraines: Often unilateral and preceded by a visual aura in the form of either scintillating scotomas (bright or ﬂashing lights) or visual field cuts.

Common migraines: May be bilateral and periorbital without preceding auras.

Dx: Based on history.

Tx:

Avoid known triggers.

Abortive therapy includes triptans (first line after OTC NSAIDs have failed), metoclopramide, and various analgesics. Consider symptomatic treatment for nausea.

In those instances when a diagnosis of labor cannot be established with certainty, observation for a longer period is often wise. Women who present to Parkland Hospital for labor 24°/7 ,. .

symptoms at weeks gestatIon or greater are routmely evaluated in a labor triage unit contiguous to our labor and delivery unit. All women in the triage area are evaluated by nurse practitioners and certiied nurse midwives using written protocols. Women with uncomplicated pregnancies with intact membranes and cervical dilation < 4 cm receive continuous external fetal monitoring for up to 2 hours. Women diagnosed with labor by either cervical change or persistent uterine contractions are admitted. After review by a physician, women without cervical change or with abatement of contractions return home with a diagnosis of false labor. In a recent study, a total of 3949 women with uncomplicated pregnancies between and 416r weeks' gestation were diagnosed with false labor. The mean inteval from hospital discharge to when they again presented was 4.9 days (Nelson, 2017). Within this protocol, hospital discharge with false labor at term was not associated with higher rates of adverse neonatal outcomes or cesarean delivery. he American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2016a) has endorsed hospital-based obstetrical triage units.

Maternal blood pressure, temperature, pulse, and respiratory rate are recorded. Fetal heart rate is evaluated using a portable Doppler device, sonography, or fetoscope. The pregnancy record is promptly reviewed to identiY complications. Problems identiied or anticipated during prenatal care should be displayed prominently in the pregnancy record. Most often, unless there has been bleeding in excess of bloody show, a cervical examination is performed. he gloved index and second ingers are introduced into the vagina while avoiding the anal region.

During prenatal care, the woman is instructed to be aware of luid leakage from the vagina and to report such an event promptly. Rupture of the membranes is signiicant for three reasons. First, if the presenting part is not ixed in the pelvis, the umbilical cord can prolapse and be compressed. Second, labor is likely to begin soon if the pregnancy is at or near term.

Chronic ectopic pregnancy is a condition in which the pregnancy does not completely resorb during expectant management. The condition arises when there is persistence of the chorionic villi with bleeding into the tubal wall, which is distended slowly and does not rupture. It may arise from chronic bleeding from the fimbriated end of the fallopian tube with subsequent tamponade. In a series of 50 patients with a chronic ectopic pregnancy, pain was present in 86%, vaginal bleeding was present in 68%, and both symptoms were present in 58% (234). Ninety percent of the patients had amenorrhea ranging from 5 to 16 weeks (mean, 9.6 weeks). Most patients develop a pelvic mass that usually is symptomatic. The β-hCG level usually is low but may be absent; ultrasonography may be helpful in the diagnosis; rarely, bowel involvement or ureteral compression or obstruction exists (234,235).

This condition is treated surgically with removal of the affected tube. Often, the ovary must be removed because there is inﬂammation with subsequent adhesion development. A hematoma may be present secondary to chronic bleeding.

Cervical Pregnancy The incidence of cervical pregnancy in the United States ranges from

Pregnancy 1 in 2,400 to 1 in 50,000 pregnancies and accounts for less than 1% of ectopic pregnancies (236,237). The cause of cervical ectopic pregnancies is unknown and the rare occurrence prevents identification of known risk factors. The incidence does appear to be higher with in vitro fertilization procedures, accounting for 3.7% of IVF-related ectopic pregnancies (238).

The clinical criteria for diagnosing a cervical pregnancy include the following findings (239): 1.

Uterus is smaller than the surrounding distended cervix; 2.

3.

4.

Profuse bleeding on manipulation of cervix.

Patients classically present with painless vaginal bleeding, but reports of associated cramping and pain are published (240).

Asking the patient when the baby first moved and if she is currently experiencing movement of the fetus is important. Determining fetal age is key for consider-ations of viability. Gestational age may be estimated by noting fundal height, with the fundus approximating the umbilicus at 20 weeks and the costal margin at 40 weeks.

Body lice remain on clothing except when feeding and generally succumb in ≤2 days if separated from their host. In most Western countries, body lice are generally found on a small proportion of indigent persons but may become increasingly prevalent after upheaval associated with natural or human-caused disasters, when homeless victims are in close contact with infested individuals with whom they share accommodations. Body lice are acquired by direct contact or by sharing of infested clothing and bedding. These lice are vectors for the agents of louse-borne (epidemic) typhus (Chap. 211), louse-borne relapsing fever (Chap. 209), and trench fever (Chap. 197). Pruritic lesions from their bites are particularly common around the neckline. Chronic infestations result in a postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and thickening of skin known as vagabond’s disease.

The crab or pubic louse is transmitted mainly by sexual contact. These lice occur predominantly on pubic hair and less frequently on axillary or facial hair, including the eyelashes. Children and adults may acquire pubic lice by sexual or close nonsexual contact. Intensely pruritic, bluish macules ~3 mm in diameter (maculae ceruleae) develop at the site of bites. Blepharitis commonly accompanies infestations of the eyelashes.

Pediculiasis is often suspected upon the detection of nits firmly cemented to hairs or in clothing. Many bona fide nits, however, are dead or hatched relics of prior infestation, and pseudo-nits are frequently misconstrued to be signs of a louse infestation. Confirmation of a louse infestation, therefore, best relies on the discovery of a live louse.

Herpes simplex virus causes a self-limited primary infection that can be reactivated when there is a compromise in host resistance. Most orofacial herpetic infections are caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), with the remainder being caused by HSV-2 (genital herpes). With changing sexual practices, oral HSV-2 is becoming increasingly common. Primary infections typically occur in children between 2 and 4 years of age and are often asymptomatic. However, in 10% to 20% of cases the primary infection manifests as acute herpetic gingivostomatitis, with abrupt onset of vesicles and ulcerations throughout the oral cavity. Most adults harbor latent HSV-1, and the virus can be reactivated, resulting in a so-called “cold sore” or recurrent herpetic stomatitis. Factors associated with HSV reactivation include trauma, allergies, exposure to ultraviolet light and extremes of temperature, upper-respiratory tract infections, pregnancy, menstruation, and immunosuppression. Recurrent lesions, which occur at the site of primary inoculation or in adjacent mucosa innervated by the same ganglion, typically appear as groups of small (1to 3-mm) vesicles. The lips (herpes labialis), nasal orifices, buccal mucosa, gingiva, and hard palate are the most common locations. Although lesions typically resolve within 7 to 10 days, they can persist in immunocompromised patients, who may require systemic anti-viral therapy. Morphologically, the lesions resemble those seen in esophageal herpes (see

Fig. 15.8 later in the chapter) and genital herpes (Chapter 19). The infected cells become ballooned and have large eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions. Adjacent cells commonly fuse to form large multinucleated polykaryons.

The position of an abnormal mass in the groin relative to the pubic tubercle is very important, as are the presence of increased temperature and pain, which may represent early signs of strangulation or infection.

As a general rule:

An inguinal hernia appears through the superficial inguinal ring above the pubic tubercle and crest.

A femoral hernia (see below) appears through the femoral canal below and lateral to the pubic tubercle.

A hernia is the protrusion of a viscus, in part or in whole, through a normal or abnormal opening. The viscus usually carries a covering of parietal peritoneum, which forms the lining of the hernial sac.

Hernias occur in a variety of regions. The commonest site is the groin of the lower anterior abdominal wall. In some patients, inguinal hernias are present from birth (congenital) and are caused by the persistence of the processus vaginalis and the passage of viscera through the inguinal canal. Acquired hernias occur in older patients and causes include raised intraabdominal pressure (e.g., from repeated coughing associated with lung disease), damage to nerves of the anterior abdominal wall (e.g., from surgical abdominal incisions), and weakening of the walls of the inguinal canal.

One of the potential problems with hernias is that bowel and fat may become stuck within the hernial sac. This can cause appreciable pain and bowel obstruction, necessitating urgent surgery. Another potential risk is strangulation of the hernia, in which the blood supply to the bowel is cut off at the neck of the hernial sac, rendering the bowel ischemic and susceptible to perforation (Fig. 4.51).

The hernial sac of an indirect inguinal hernia enters the deep inguinal ring and passes through the inguinal canal. If the hernia is large enough, the hernial sac may emerge through the superficial inguinal ring. In men, such a hernia may extend into the scrotum (Fig. 4.52).

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) occurs when GERleads to troublesome symptoms or complications such as poorgrowth, pain, or breathing difficulties. GERD occurs in a minorityof infants but is often implicated as the cause of fussiness. GERDis seen in fewer than 5% of older children. In older children, normal protective mechanisms against GER include antegradeesophageal motility, tonic contraction of the LES, and the geometry of the gastroesophageal junction. Abnormalities that causeGER in older children and adults include reduced tone of the LES, transient relaxations of the LES, esophagitis (which impairsesophageal motility), increased intra-abdominal pressure, cough,respiratory difficulty (asthma or cystic fibrosis), and hiatal hernia.

Cough Hoarseness Wheezing Abdominal Pain Failure to Thrive

The presence of GER is easy to observe in an infant who spits up. In older children, the refluxate is usually kept down by reswallowing, but GER may be suspected by associated symptoms, such as heartburn, cough, epigastric abdominal pain, dysphagia, wheezing, aspiration pneumonia, hoarse voice, failure to thrive, and recurrent otitis media or sinusitis. In severe cases of esophagitis, there may be laboratory evidence of anemia and hypoalbuminemia secondary to esophageal bleeding and inflammation.

When esophagitis develops as a result of acid reflux, esophageal motility and LES function are impaired further, creating a cycle of reflux and esophageal injury.

Signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary depending on the infecting organism and the patient’s immune status. In typical pneumonias, the usual presentation is a patient with high fever, rigors, productive cough, chills, and pleuritic chest pain. Chest radiography often will show infiltrates (11). The following agents, listed in decreasing order, cause two-thirds of all bacterial pneumonias: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus inﬂuenza, Klebsiella pneumoniae, gram-negative organisms, and anaerobic bacteria. Atypical pneumonias are more insidious in onset than typical pneumonias. Patients have moderate fever without the characteristic rigors and chills. Additional symptoms include a nonproductive cough, headache, myalgias, and mild leukocytosis. Chest radiography reveals bronchopneumonia with a diffuse interstitial pattern; characteristically, the patient does not appear to be as ill as the x-ray suggests. Common causes of atypical pneumonia include viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia pneumoniae (also called the TWAR agent), and other rare agents.

A strong index of suspicion is required for diagnosis, especially in elderly and immunocompromised individuals, who have altered response mechanisms. This is true with “typical agents.” Subtle clues in the elderly include changes in mentation, confusion, and exacerbation of other illnesses. The febrile response may be entirely absent, and the results of the physical examination are not predictive of pneumonia. In high-risk groups, an increased respiratory rate of greater than 25 breaths per minute remains the most reliable sign of infection. Mortality in these high-risk groups of patients is strongly correlated with the ability of the host to mount normal defenses to the symptoms of fever, chills, and tachycardia.

All women suspected of having pneumonia should undergo chest radiography to establish the diagnosis and to detect alternate diagnoses such as congestive heart failure and tumors.

MMR vaccine should be ofered to nonpregnant women of childbearing age who do not have evidence of immunity whenever they make contact with the health-care system. Vaccination of all susceptible hospital personnel who might be exposed to patients with rubella or who might have contact with pregnant women is important. Rubella vaccination should be avoided 1 month before or during pregnancy because the vaccine contains attenuated live virus. No observed evidence links the vaccine and induced malformations, although the overall theoretical risk is up to 2.6 percent (McLean, 2013;

Swamy, 2015). MMR vaccination is not an indication for pregnancy termination.

Prenatal serological screening for rubella is indicated for all pregnant women. Women found to be nonimmune are ofered the MMR vaccine postpartum.

More than 200 antigenically distinct respiratory viruses cause the cominon cold, pharyngitis, laryngitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Rhinovirus, coronavirus, and adenovirus are major causes of the common cold. The RNA-containing rhinovirus and coronavirus usually produce a trivial, self-limited illness characterized by rhinorrhea, sneezing, and congestion. he DNA-containing adenovirus is more likely to produce cough and lower respiratory tract involvement, including pneumonia.

Rhinitis can be divided into allergic and nonallergic rhinitis (Table 79-1). Nonallergic rhinitis describes a group of nasal diseases in which there is no evidence of allergic etiology. It can be divided further into nonanatomic and anatomic etiologies. The most common form of nonallergic rhinitis in children is infectious rhinitis, which may be acute or chronic. Acute infectious rhinitis (the common cold) is caused by viruses, including rhinoviruses and coronaviruses, and typically resolves within 7 to 10 days (see Chapter 102). An average child has three to six common colds per year,

Examination of the chest includes inspection of the chest wall to identify asymmetry resulting from absence of the pectoralis muscle and inspection of the breast tissue to determine gestational age and detect a breast abscess. Boys and girls may have breast engorgement and produce milk; milk expression should not be attempted. Supernumerary nipples may be bilateral and may be associated with renal anomalies.

Examination of the lungs includes observations of the rate, depth, and nature of intercostal or sternal retractions. Breath sounds should be equal on both sides of the chest, and rales should not be heard after the first 1 to 2 hours of life. Diminished or absent breath sounds on one side suggest pneumothorax, collapsed lung, pleural effusion, or diaphragmatic hernia. Shift of the cardiac impulse away from a tension pneumothorax and diaphragmatic hernia and toward the collapsed lung is a helpful physical finding for differentiating these disorders. Subcutaneous emphysema of the neck or chest also suggests a pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum, whereas bowel sounds auscultated in the chest in the presence of a scaphoid abdomen suggest a diaphragmatic hernia.

The position of the heart in infants is more midline than in older children. The first heart sound is normal, whereas the second heart sound may not be split in the first day of life. Decreased splitting of the second heart sound is noted in PPHN, transposition of the great vessels, and pulmonary atresia. Heart murmurs in newborns are common in the delivery room and during the first day of life. Most of these murmurs are transient and are due to closure of the ductus arteriosus, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, or a small ventral septal defect. Pulses should be palpated in the upper and lower extremities (over the brachial and femoral arteries). Blood pressure in the upper and lower extremities should be measured in all patients with a murmur or heart failure. An upperto-lower extremity gradient of more than 10 to 20 mm Hg suggests coarctation of the aorta.

Rarely, myocardial rupture may be contained by a local area of pericardium, along with organizing thrombus and hematoma. Over time, this pseudoaneurysm enlarges, maintaining communication with the LV cavity through a narrow neck. Because a pseudoaneurysm often ruptures spontaneously, it should be surgically repaired if recognized.

Many clinical and laboratory factors have been identified that are associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk after initial recovery from STEMI. Some of the most important factors include persistent ischemia (spontaneous or provoked), depressed LV ejection fraction (<40%), rales above the lung bases on physical examination or congestion on chest radiograph, and symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias. Other features associated with increased risk include a history of previous MI, age >75, diabetes mellitus, prolonged sinus tachycardia, hypotension, ST-segment changes at rest without angina (“silent ischemia”), an abnormal signal-averaged ECG, nonpatency of the infarct-related coronary artery (if angiography is undertaken), and persistent advanced heart block or a new intraventricular conduction abnormality on the ECG. Therapy must be individualized on the basis of the relative importance of the risk(s) present.

Chest Imaging (See Chap. 308e) Most patients with disease of the respiratory system undergo imaging of the chest as part of the initial evaluation. Clinicians should generally begin with a plain chest radio-graph, preferably posterior-anterior and lateral films. Several findings, including opacities of the parenchyma, blunting of the costophrenic angles, mass lesions, and volume loss, can be very helpful in determining an etiology. However, many diseases of the respiratory system, particularly those of the airways and pulmonary vasculature, are asso ciated with a normal chest radiograph.

CT of the chest is often performed subsequently and allows better delineation of parenchymal processes, pleural disease, masses or nodules, and large airways. If the test includes administration of contrast, the pulmonary vasculature can be assessed with particular utility for determination of pulmonary emboli. Intravenous contrast also allows lymph nodes to be delineated in greater detail.

Depending on the clinician’s suspicion, a variety of other studies may be done. Concern about large-airway lesions may warrant bronchoscopy. This procedure may also be used to sample the alveolar space with bronchoalveolar lavage or to obtain nonsurgical lung biopsies. Blood testing may include assessment for hypercoagulable states in the setting of pulmonary vascular disease, serologic testing for infectious or rheumatologic disease, or assessment of inflammatory markers or leukocyte counts (e.g., eosinophils). Sputum evaluation for malignant cells or microorganisms may be appropriate. An echocardiogram to assess rightand left-sided heart function is often obtained. Finally, at times, a surgical lung biopsy is needed to diagnose certain diseases of the respiratory system. All of these studies will be guided by the preceding history, physical examination, pulmonary function testing, and chest imaging.

History and Physical Examination The chest discomfort, often severe enough to be described as frank pain, is typically located in the sub-sternal region or sometimes in the epigastrium, and radiates to the left arm, left shoulder, and/or neck. Anginal “equivalents” such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension.

Electrocardiogram ST-segment depression occurs in 20 to 25% of patients; it may be transient in patients without biomarker evidence of myocardial necrosis, but may be persistent for several days in NSTEMI. T-wave changes are common but are less specific signs of ischemia, unless they are new and deep T-wave inversions (≥0.3 mV).

HIV-infected pregnant women from the beginning of the second trimester through delivery and of the infant for 6 weeks following birth dramatically decreased the rate of intrapartum and perinatal transmission of HIV infection from 22.6% in the untreated group to <5%. Today, the rate of motherto-child transmission has fallen to 1% or less in pregnant women who are receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for their HIV infection. Such treatment, combined with cesarean section delivery, has rendered mother-to-child transmission of HIV an unusual event in the United States and other developed nations. In this regard, both

HIV Infection (See also Chap. 226) The predominant cause of HIV infection in children is transmission of the virus from mother to newborn during the perinatal period. All pregnant women should be screened for HIV infection. Factors that increase the risk of mother-to-newborn transmission include high maternal viral load, low maternal CD4+ T cell count, prolonged labor, prolonged duration of membrane rupture, and the presence of other genital tract infections, such as syphilis or herpes. Prior to the widespread use of antiretroviral treatment, the perinatal transmission rate was in the range of 20%. In women with a good response to antiretroviral treatment, the transmission rate is about 1%. Measurement of maternal plasma HIV RNA copy number guides the decision for vaginal versus cesarean delivery. For women with <1000 copies of plasma HIV RNA/ml who are receiving combination antiretroviral therapy, the risk of transmission to the newborn is approximately 1% regardless of mode of delivery or duration of membrane rupture. These women may elect to attempt a vaginal birth following the spontaneous onset of labor. For women with a viral load of ≥1000 copies/ml prior to 38 weeks of gestation, a scheduled prelabor cesarean at 38 weeks is recommended to reduce the risk of HIV transmission to the newborn. To reduce the risk of mother-to-newborn transmission, women with >400 copies of HIV RNA/ml should be treated during the intrapartum interval with zidovudine. All newborns of HIV-infected mothers should be treated with zidovudine for 6 months after birth. Women who are HIV-positive may transmit the virus through their breast milk. In developed countries, HIV-infected mothers are advised not to breast-feed.

(See also Chap. 148) For rubella-nonimmune individuals contemplating pregnancy, measles-mumps-rubella vaccine should be administered, ideally at least 3 months prior to conception but otherwise in the immediate postpartum period. In addition, pregnancy is not a contraindication for vaccination against influenza, tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap), and these vaccines are recommended for appropriate individuals.

In the absence of prophylactic antiretroviral therapy to the mother during pregnancy, labor, and delivery, and to the fetus following birth, the probability of transmission of HIV from mother to infant/ fetus ranges from 15% to 25% in industrialized countries and from 25% to 35% in developing countries. These differences may relate to the adequacy of prenatal care as well as to the stage of HIV disease and the general health of the mother during pregnancy. Higher rates of transmission have been reported to be associated with many factors—the best documented of which is the presence of

Congenital CMV infections pose a much greater problem than does rubella. There is no way of identifying the infected fetus prior to birth or to prevent inapparent infections in the pregnant woman. As indicated above, if the pregnant woman has measurable titers of antibodies to CMV at the time of conception, her infant is relatively protected. Moreover, some infected infants (with viruria) may appear normal at birth but develop neural deafness and developmental delay several years later. Viral replication in infected organs continues after the first year and health workers are at risk. A second child may be infected.

There is no known treatment. The difficulties in prenatal diagnosis of maternal infection preclude planned abortion. Routine serologic testing should be done on every young woman of childbearing age. Until an effective vaccine becomes available, pregnancy should be avoided if a sexual partner is infected.

In the United States, approximately 10 percent of cases of AIDS have occurred in women, almost all of them of childbearing age, and the rate of new cases is increasing at a faster rate among them than among men. The numbers are higher in many developing countries. In children, practically all instances of AIDS come from an HIV-infected mother (“vertical transmission”). The infection may be acquired in utero, during delivery, or from breast-feeding. The relative importance of each of these modes of transmission has not been settled.

Treatment of all forms of hypoglycemia obviously consists of correction of the hypoglycemia at the earliest possible moment. It is not known whether hypothermia or other measures will increase the safety period in hypoglycemia or alter the outcome. Seizures and twitching may not stop with antiepileptic drugs until the hypoglycemia is corrected.

Two syndromes have been defined, mainly in diabetics: (1) hyperglycemia with ketoacidosis and (2) hyperosmolar nonketotic hyperglycemia.

In diabetic acidosis, the familiar picture is one of dehydration, fatigue, weakness, headache, abdominal pain, dryness of the mouth, stupor or coma, and Kussmaul type of breathing. Usually the condition has developed over a period of days in a patient known or proven to be diabetic. Often, the patient had failed to take a regular insulin dose. The blood glucose level is found to be more than 400 mg/dL, the pH of the blood less than 7.20, and the bicarbonate less than 10 mEq/L. Ketone bodies and b-hydroxybutyric acid are elevated in the blood and urine, and there is marked glycosuria. The prompt administration of insulin and repletion of intravascular volume correct the clinical and chemical abnormalities over a period of hours.

■Somogyi effect: Nocturnal hypoglycemia leading to a surge of counterregulatory hormones, leading in turn to hyperglycemia in the morning.

■Dawn phenomenon: Nocturnal secretion of GH leading to early-morning hyperglycemia.

Patients typically present with symptoms of hyperglycemia.

Onset is more insidious than that of type 1 DM, and patients often present with complications.

Nonketotic hyperglycemia may be seen in the setting of poor glycemic control.

Usually occurs in older adults with obesity (often truncal); has a strong genetic predisposition.

Diagnostic criteria are the same as those for type 1 DM.

Follow-up testing:

Patients with no risk factors: Test at 45 years of age; retest every three years.

Patients with impaired fasting glucose (> 110 mg/dL but < 126 mg/ dL): Follow up with frequent retesting.

The goal of treatment is tight glucose control—i.e., blood glucose levels ranging from 80 to 120 mg/dL and HbA1c levels < 7. Treatment measures include the following:

Diet, weight loss, and exercise.

Oral agents (monotherapy or combination if uncontrolled):

Sulfonylureas (glipizide, glyburide, and glimepiride): Insulin secretagogues. Hypoglycemia and weight gain are side effects.

Meglitinides (repaglinide and nateglinide): Short-acting agents whose mechanism of action is similar to that of sulfonylureas.

Metformin: Inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis; ↑ peripheral sensitivity to insulin. Side effects include weight loss, GI upset, and, rarely, lactic acidosis. Contraindicated in the elderly (those > 80 years of age) and in patients with renal disease.

Thiazolidinediones (the “glitazones”): ↑ insulin sensitivity. Side effects include weight gain, edema, and potential hepatotoxicity.

document (2) 

α-glucosidase inhibitors: ↓ intestinal absorption of carbohydrates. Rarely used owing to the side effect of ﬂ atulence.

DDP-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin): Inhibit the degradation of the endogenous enzyme that breaks down glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1).

Insulin (alone or in conjunction with oral agents).

Incretins (exenatide): GLP-1 agonists. Injected subcutaneously. Delay absorption of food; ↑ insulin secretion and ↓ glucagon secretion. Side effects include nausea and (rarely) pancreatitis.

Statins for hypercholesterolemia (goal LDL < 100); glucose control and fibric acid derivatives for hypertriglyceridemia.

Strict BP control to < 130/80; ACEIs/ARBs are usually first-line agents.

Antiplatelet agents (ASA) for patients at risk of cardiovascular disease or for those > 40 years of age.

Regular screening for cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, and smoking cessation.

See Table 2.3-2 for an outline of the complications of DM. Note that the presence of diabetes is equivalent to the highest risk for cardiovascular disease regardless of all other risk factors.

Also known as insulin resistance syndrome or syndrome X. Associated with an ↑ risk of CAD and mortality from a cardiovascular event.

Presents with abdominal obesity, high BP, impaired glycemic control, and dyslipidemia.

Three out of five of the following criteria must be met:

Abdominal obesity (↑ waist girth): > 40 inches in men and > 35 inches in women.

Triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL.

HDL < 40 mg/dL in men and < 50 mg/dL in women.

BP ≥ 130/85 mmHg or administration of antihypertensive drugs.

Fasting glucose ≥ 100 mg/dL.

In hyperosmolar nonketotic hyperglycemia, the blood glucose is extremely high, more than 600 mg/dL, but ketoacidosis does not develop, or if it does develop, it is mild. Osmolality is usually in excess of 330 mOsm/L. There is also hemoconcentration and prerenal azotemia. Appreciation of the neurologic syndrome is generally credited to Wegierko, who published descriptions of it in 1956 and 1957. Most of the patients are elderly diabetics but some were not previously known to have been diabetic. An infection, enteritis, pancreatitis, dehydration, or a drug known to upset diabetic control (thiazides, corticosteroids, and phenytoin) leads to polyuria, fatigue, confusion, stupor, and coma. Often the syndrome arises in conjunction with the combined use of corticosteroids and phenytoin (which inhibits insulin release), for example, in elderly patients with brain tumors. The use of osmotic diuretics enhances the risk.

Seizures and focal signs such as a hemiparesis, a hemisensory defect, choreoathetosis, or a homonymous visual field defect are more common than in any other metabolic encephalopathy and may erroneously suggest the possibility of a stroke. Fluids should be replaced cautiously, using isotonic saline and potassium. Correction of the markedly elevated blood glucose requires relatively small amounts of insulin, since these patients often do not have a high degree of insulin resistance.

Primary Amenorrhea The absence of menses by age 16 has been used traditionally to define primary amenorrhea. However, other factors, such as growth, secondary sexual characteristics, the presence of cyclic pelvic pain, and the secular trend toward an earlier age of menarche, particularly in African-American girls, also influence the age at which primary amenorrhea should be investigated. Thus, an evaluation for amenorrhea should be initiated by age 15 or 16 in the presence of normal growth and secondary sexual characteristics; age 13 in the absence of secondary sexual characteristics or if height is less than the third percentile; age 12 or 13 in the presence of breast development and cyclic pelvic pain; or within 2 years of breast development if menarche, defined by the first menstrual period, has not occurred.

Secondary Amenorrhea or Oligomenorrhea Anovulation and irregular cycles are relatively common for up to 2 years after menarche and for 1–2 years before the final menstrual period. In the intervening years, menstrual cycle length is ~28 days, with an intermenstrual interval normally ranging between 25 and 35 days. Cycle-to-cycle variability in an individual woman who is ovulating consistently is generally +/− 2 days. Pregnancy is the most common cause of amenorrhea and should be excluded early in any evaluation of menstrual irregularity. However, many women occasionally miss a single period. Three or more months of secondary amenorrhea should prompt an evaluation, as should a history of intermenstrual intervals >35 or <21 days or bleeding that persists for >7 days.

Other important hormonal changes also occur in conjunction with puberty. Growth hormone (GH) levels increase early in puberty, stimulated in part by the pubertal increases in estrogen secretion. GH increases insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), which enhances linear growth. The growth spurt is generally less pronounced in girls than in boys, with a peak growth velocity of ~7 cm/year. Linear growth is ultimately limited by closure of epiphyses in the long bones as a result of prolonged exposure to estrogen. Puberty is also associated with mild insulin resistance.

Disorders of the Female Reproductive System length counted from the first day of menses to the first day of subsequent menses is ~28 days, with a range of 25–35 days. However, cycle-to-cycle variability for an individual

The differential diagnosis of precocious and delayed puberty is similar in boys (Chap. 411) and girls. However, there are differences in the timing of normal puberty and differences in the relative frequency of specific disorders in girls compared with boys.

Precocious Puberty Traditionally, precocious puberty has been defined as the development of secondary sexual characteristics before the age of 8 in girls based on data from Marshall and Tanner in British girls studied in the 1960s. More recent studies led to recommendations that girls be evaluated for precocious puberty if breast development or pubic hair is present at <7 years of age for white girls or <6 years for black girls.

Anovulation Anovulatory bleeding can be too frequent, prolonged, or heavy, particularly after a long interval of amenorrhea. The physiology of this phenomenon relates to a failure of the feedback mechanism in which rising estrogen levels result in a decline in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) with subsequent decline of estrogen levels. In anovulatory cycles, estrogen secretion continues, resulting in endometrial proliferation with subsequent unstable growth and incomplete shedding. The clinical result is irregular, prolonged, and heavy bleeding.

Studies of adolescent menses show differences in rates of ovulation based on the number of months or years postmenarche. The younger the age at menarche, the sooner regular ovulation is established. In one study, the time from menarche until 50% of the cycles were ovulatory was 1 year for girls whose menarche occurred when they were younger than 12 years of age, 3 years for girls whose menarche occurred between 12 and 12.9 years of age, and 4.5 years for girls whose menarche occurred at 13 years of age or older (62).

Pregnancy-Related Bleeding The possibility of pregnancy must be considered when an adolescent seeks treatment for abnormal bleeding (Table 14.7). Bleeding in pregnancy can be associated with a spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy, or other pregnancy-related complications, such as a molar pregnancy. In the United States, 30% of 15-to 17-year-old adolescent girls have had sexual intercourse, as have 70.6% of those 18 to 19 years old (63). Issues of confidentiality for adolescent health care are critical to an adolescent’s willingness to seek appropriate reproductive health care (see Chapter 1).

Exogenous Hormones The cause of abnormal bleeding that is experienced while an individual is taking exogenous hormones usually is very different from bleeding that occurs without hormonal manipulation (64). Oral contraceptive use is associated with breakthrough bleeding, which occurs in as many as 30% to 40% of individuals during the first cycle of combination pill use. In addition, irregular bleeding can result from missed pills (65,66). Strict

delayed puberty in a parent or sibling is reassuring. Spontaneous puberty usually begins in these patients by the time the bone age reaches 12 years in boys and 11 years in girls. Other causes of delayed puberty must be eliminated before a diagnosis of constitutional delay in puberty is made. Observation and reassurance are appropriate. Adult height normal for the genetic potential is generally attained. In some cases, boys may be treated with low-dose testosterone for a few months if the bone age is at least 11 to 12 years. Treatment is not required for longer than 4 to

longer than 4 to 8 months because endogenous hormone production usually ensues. Boys who do not initiate endogenous hormone production should be evaluated for other causes of hypogonadism. Estrogen treatment has been used in girls with constitutional delay, but there are no clear studies showing the added benefits. Young women with delayed puberty may need to be evaluated for primary amenorrhea.

Patients with constitutional delay have delayed onset of pubertal development and significant bone age delay (2 standard deviations below the mean, which is equal to a 1.5to 2-year delay as a teenager). The height of the patient should remain close to the genetic potential, based on the parental heights, when reinterpreted for bone age (see Chapter 173). Usuallyheight gain is below, although fairly parallel to, the normal percentiles on the growth curve.

Poliovirus is an enterovirus that most often causes a sub-clinical or mild gastroenteritis; in a small fraction of cases, it secondarily invades the nervous system and damages motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain stem (paralytic poliomyelitis). The loss of motor neurons results in a flaccid paralysis with muscle wasting and hyporeflexia in the corresponding region of the body. In the acute disease, death can occur from paralysis of respiratory muscles. Long after the infection has resolved, typically 25 to 35 years after the initial illness, a poorly understood post-polio syndromeof progressive weakness associated with decreased muscle bulk and pain may appear. The re-emergent weakness has the same distribution as the prior polio infection.

Rabies is a fatal encephalitic infection transmitted to humans from rabid animals, usually by a bite. Various mammals are natural reservoirs. Exposure to some bat species, even without evidence of a bite, is also a risk factor. The virus enters the CNS by ascending along the peripheral nerves from the wound site, so the incubation period (usually a few months) depends on the distance between the wound and the brain. The disease manifests initially with nonspecific symptoms of malaise, headache, and fever. As the infection advances, the patient shows extraordinary CNS excitability; the slightest touch is painful, with violent motor responses progressing to convulsions. Contracture of the pharyngeal musculature may create an aversion to swallowing even water (hydrophobia). Periods of mania and stupor progress to coma and eventually death, typically from respiratory failure.

Imaging the brain and spinal cord is accomplished using CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CT is quick and accessible for emergency purposes. MRI provides fine detail and, with different sequences, permits detection of posterior fossa lesions, subtle cerebral abnormalities, vascular anomalies, low-grade tumors, and ischemic changes. For a child with a head injury or sudden headache, cranial CT is the study of choice because it can rapidly reveal intracranial hemorrhage or other large lesions. For a child with new-onset complex partial seizures, MRI is the study of choice, because an area of focal cortical dysplasia or other subtle lesions might not be apparent on CT. MRI also provides excellent views of the spinal cord. Cranial ultrasonography is a noninvasive bedside procedure used to visualize the brain and ventricles of infants and young children with open fontanelles.

Headache is a common symptom among children and adolescents. Headaches can be a primary problem (migraines, tension-type headaches) or secondary to another condition. Secondary headaches are most often associated with minor illnesses such as viral upper respiratory infections or sinusitis, but may be the first symptom of serious conditions (meningitis, brain tumors), so a systematic approach is necessary.

The temporal pattern of the headache must be clarified. Each pattern (acute, recurrent-episodic, chronic-progressive, chronic-nonprogressive) has its own differential diagnosis (Table 180-1).

Tension-type headaches are the most common recurrent pattern of primary headaches in children and adolescents. They are generally mild and lack associated symptoms, so are not typically disruptive to patients’ lifestyle or activities. The pain is global and squeezing or pressing in character, but can last for hours or days. There is no associated nausea, vomiting, phonophobia, or photophobia. Headaches can be related to environmental stresses or symptomatic of underlying psychiatric illnesses, such as anxiety or depression.

accompaniments that may persist for several weeks. Encephalitis, sequelae, and death are all more common among elderly, diabetic, and hypertensive patients and among patients with previous CNS insults. In addition to the more severe motor and cognitive sequelae, milder findings may include tremor, slight abnormalities in motor skills, and loss of executive functions. Intense clinical interest and the availability of laboratory diagnostic methods have made it possible to define a number of unusual clinical features. Such features include chorioretinitis, flaccid paralysis with histologic lesions resembling poliomyelitis, and initial presentation with fever and focal neurologic

fever and focal neurologic deficits in the absence of diffuse encephalitis. Immunosuppressed patients may have fulminant courses or develop persistent CNS infection. Virus transmission through both transplantation and blood transfusion has necessitated screening of blood and organ donors by nucleic acid–based tests. Occasionally, pregnant women infect their fetuses with West Nile virus.

West Nile virus is a common cause of febrile disease without CNS involvement (incubation period, 3–14 days), but it occasionally causes aseptic meningitis and severe encephalitis, particularly among the elderly. The fever–myalgia syndrome caused by West Nile virus differs from that caused by other viruses in terms of the frequent—rather than occasional—appearance of a maculopapular rash concentrated on the trunk (especially in children) and the development of lymphadenopathy. Back pain, fatigue, headache, myalgia, retroorbital pain, sore throat, nausea and vomiting, and arthralgia (but not arthritis) are common accompaniments that may persist

The disease is usually chronic and progressive, with some patients becoming completely depigmented.

Many patients have serologic markers of autoimmune disease (e.g., antithyroid antibodies, DM, pernicious anemia) but seldom present with these diseases. Patients with malignant melanoma may develop an antimelanocyte immune response that leads to vitiligo.

Diagnosed by the history and clinical picture, with histology demonstrating total absence of melanocytes. Conditions to rule out include postinﬂ ammatory hypopigmentation, scleroderma, piebaldism, and toxic exposure (pheno-lated cleansers are toxic to melanocytes).

Topical or systemic psoralens and exposure to sunlight or PUVA may be helpful. Patients must wear sunscreen because depigmented skin lacks inherent sun protection. Dyes and makeup may be used to color the skin, or the skin may be chemically bleached to produce a uniformly white color.

A very common skin tumor, appearing in almost all patients after age 40. The etiology is unknown. When many seborrheic keratoses erupt suddenly, they may be part of a paraneoplastic syndrome due to tumor production of epidermal growth factors. Lesions have no malignant potential but may be a cosmetic problem.

Present as exophytic, waxy brown papules and plaques with prominent follicle openings (see Figure 2.2-15). Lesions often appear in great numbers and have a “stuck-on” appearance.

Lesions may become irritated either spontaneously or by external trauma, “Seborrheic keratoses, or especially in the groin, breast, or axillae. Irritated lesions are smoother and SKs, look StucK on.” redder.

Diagnosed by the clinical picture; can be confirmed by histology showing hyperplasia of benign, basaloid epidermal cells with horn pseudocysts (prominent follicular openings). Rule out actinic keratosis, lentigo (focal ↑ in melanocytes), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and basal cell carcinoma (BCC).

consequent decrease in the number of melanocytes. Melanocyte depletion occurs with age, resulting in a decreased rate of pigment donation to keratinocytes. Therefore, the skin becomes lighter with increased age, and the incidence of skin cancer also increases. Melanocyte depletion caused by defective self-maintenance of melanocyte stem cells is also linked to hair graying, the most obvious sign of aging in humans. Individ-uals with a mutation in the Bcl2 gene may become prema-turely gray.

His past medical history is significant for hypercholesterolemia, well managed with rosuvastatin, and hypertension, well managed with hydrochlorothiazide. His current medications also include aspirin. The patient is afebrile, and his vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable.

Physical Findings Splenomegaly is the most common physical finding, occurring in 20–70% of patients depending on health care screening frequency. Other less common findings include hepatomegaly (10–20%), lymphadenopathy (5–10%), and extramedullary disease (skin or subcutaneous lesions). The latter indicates CML transformation if a biopsy confirms the presence of sheets of blasts. Other physical findings are manifestations of complications of high tumor burden described earlier (e.g., cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, bleeding). High basophil counts may be associated with histamine overproduction causing pruritus, diarrhea, flushing, and even gastrointestinal ulcers.

Hematologic and Marrow Findings In untreated CML, leukocytosis ranging from 10–500 × 109/L is common. The peripheral blood differential shows left-shifted hematopoiesis with predominance of neutrophils and the presence of bands, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, promyelocytes, and blasts (usually ≤5%). Basophils and/or eosinophils are frequently increased. Thrombocytosis is common, but thrombocytopenia is rare and, when present, suggests a worse prognosis, disease acceleration, or an unrelated etiology. Anemia is present in one-third of patients. Cyclic oscillations of counts are noted in 25% of patients without treatment. Biochemical abnormalities include a low leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score and high levels of vitamin B12, uric acid, lactic dehydrogenase, and lysozyme. The presence of unexplained and sustained leukocytosis, with or without splenomegaly, should lead to a marrow examination and cytogenetic analysis.

document (1) 

Accelerated: A transition toward blast crisis, with an ↑ in peripheral and bone marrow blood counts. Should be suspected when the differential shows an abrupt ↑ in basophils and thrombocytopenia < 100,000.

Blast: Resembles acute leukemia; survival is 3–6 months.

■Diagnosed by the clinical picture, including labs; cytogenetic analysis usually reveals the Philadelphia chromosome.

TAB LE 2.7 -7. Clinical Staging of CLL (Rai Staging)

CBwC shows a very high WBC—often > 100,000 at diagnosis, and sometimes reaching > 500,000. Differential shows granulocytes in all stages of maturation. Rarely, the WBC count will be so elevated as to cause a hyperviscosity syndrome.

Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase is low; LDH, uric acid, and B12 levels are elevated.

Varies with disease phase and is undergoing rapid change, particularly since the introduction of targeted therapies:

Chronic: Imatinib. Younger patients can be treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation if a suitable matched sibling donor is available.

Blast: Therapy as for acute leukemia or dasatinib plus hematopoietic stem cell transplant or clinical trial.

A malignant disorder of well-differentiated B lymphocytes with an unclear cause. HCL is a rare disease that accounts for 2% of adult leukemia cases and most commonly affects older males.

Typically presents with pancytopenia, bone marrow infiltration, and splenomegaly.

Patients complain of weakness, fatigue, petechiae and bruising, infection (especially with atypical mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium avium– intracellulare), abdominal pain, early satiety, and weight loss. Symptoms are similar to those of CLL except that patients rarely have lymphadenopathy.

Diagnosed by the history, physical exam, and labs; confirmed through the identification of hairy cells in the blood, marrow, or spleen.

The WBC count is usually elevated, but the cells are dysfunctional, and patients may be neutropenic with a history of frequent infection. If the WBC is very high (> 100,000), there is a risk of leukostasis (blasts occluding the microcirculation, leading to pulmonary edema, CNS symptoms, ischemic injury, and DIC).

The type of acute leukemia is further classified according to the FAB system (ALL: L1–L3; AML: M0–M7) and karyotype analysis. Prognosis varies with leukemic cytogenetics.

Size Larger (2–4 times RBC) Smaller (1.5–3.0 times RBC) Amount of cytoplasm More Less Nucleoli Conspicuous Inconspicuous Granules Common, f ne Uncommon, coarse Auer rods Present in 50% of cases Absent Myeloperoxidase

ALL and AML are treated primarily with chemotherapeutic agents, although transfusions, antibiotics, and colony-stimulating factors are also used. Patients with unfavorable genetics or those who do not achieve remission may be candidates for bone marrow transplantation.

Prior to therapy, patients should be well hydrated, and if their WBC counts are high, they may be started on allopurinol to prevent hyperuricemia and renal insufficiency resulting from blast lysis (tumor lysis syndrome).

Leukostasis syndrome may be treated with hydroxyurea +/– leukapheresis to rapidly ↓ WBC count.

Indicators of a poor prognosis are as follows:

ALL: Age < 1 year or > 10 years; an ↑ in WBC count to > 50,000; the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome t(9,22) (associated with B-cell cancer); CNS involvement at diagnosis; and L3 morphology (associated with Burkitt’s lymphoma).

document (3) 

The median presenting leukocyte count is about 15,000/μL. Between 25 and 40% of patients have counts <5000/μL, and 20% have counts >100,000/μL. Fewer than 5% have no detectable leukemic cells in the blood. The morphology of the malignant cell varies in different subsets. In AML, the cytoplasm often contains primary (nonspecific) granules, and the nucleus shows fine, lacy chromatin with one or more nucleoli characteristic of immature cells. Abnormal rod-shaped granules called Auer rods are not uniformly present, but when they are, myeloid lineage is virtually certain (Fig. 132-1). Poor neutrophil function may be noted functionally by impaired phagocytosis and migration and morphologically by abnormal lobulation and deficient granulation.

Platelet counts <100,000/μL are found at diagnosis in ~75% of patients, and about 25% have counts <25,000/μL. Both morphologic and functional platelet abnormalities can be observed, including large and bizarre shapes with abnormal granulation and inability of platelets to aggregate or adhere normally to one another.

Pretreatment Evaluation Once the diagnosis of AML is suspected, a rapid evaluation and initiation of appropriate therapy should follow. In addition to clarifying the subtype of leukemia, initial studies should evaluate the overall functional integrity of the major organ systems, including the cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, and renal systems (Table 132-4). Factors that have prognostic significance, either for achieving CR or for predicting the duration of CR, should also be assessed before initiating treatment, including cytogenetics and molecular markers (see above). Leukemic cells should be obtained from all patients and cryopreserved for future use as new tests and therapeutics become available. All patients should be evaluated for infection.

Most patients are anemic and thrombocytopenic at presentation. Replacement of the appropriate blood components, if necessary, should begin promptly. Because qualitative platelet dysfunction or the presence of an infection may increase the likelihood of bleeding, evidence of hemorrhage justifies the immediate use of platelet transfusion, even if the platelet count is only moderately decreased.

His review of systems was otherwise negative. He denied drug or laxative abuse and was on no medications. Past medical history was unremarkable, with no history of neuromuscular disease. Family history was notable for a sister with thyroid disease. Physical examination was notable only for reduced deep tendon reflexes.

This patient developed hypokalemia due to a redistribution of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular compartments; this pathophysiology was readily apparent following calculation of the TTKG. The TTKG is calculated as (P × U )/(P ×

U ). The expected values for the TTKG are <3 in the presence of hypokalemia and >7–8 in the presence of hyperkalemia (see also Case 2 and Case 8). Alternatively, a urinary K+-to-creatinine ratio of >13 mmol/g creatinine (>1.5 mmol/mmol creatinine) is compatible with excessive renal K+ excretion. In this case, the calculated TTKG was 2.5, consistent with appropriate renal conservation of K+ and a nonrenal cause for hypokalemia. In the absence of significant gastrointestinal loss of K+, the patient was diagnosed with a “redistributive” subtype of hypokalemia.

respectively. Some centers have adopted more sensitive criteria, using values of <5.3 mmol/L (<95 mg/dL), <10 mmol/L (<180 mg/dL), <8.6 mmol/L (<155 mg/dL), and <7.8 mmol/L (<140 mg/dL) as the upper norms for a 3-h glucose tolerance test. Two elevated glucose values indicate a positive test. Adverse pregnancy outcomes for mother and fetus appear to increase with glucose as a continuous variable; thus it is challenging to define the optimal threshold for establishing the diagnosis of gestational diabetes.

The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly.

The plasma Na+ concentration on admission was 113 meq/L, with a creatinine of 2.35 (Table 64e-1). At hospital hour 7, the plasma Na+ concentration was 120 meq/L, potassium 5.4 meq/L, chloride 90 64e-5 meq/L, bicarbonate 22 meq/L, BUN 32 mg/dL, creatinine 2.02 mg/dL, glucose 89 mg/dL, total protein 5.0, and albumin 1.9. The hematocrit was 33.9, white count 7.6, and platelets 405. A morning cortisol was 19.5, with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 1.7. The patient was treated with 1 μg of intravenous DDAVP, along with 75 mL/h of intravenous half-normal saline. After the plasma Na+ concentration dropped to 116 meq/L, intravenous fluid was switched to normal saline at the same infusion rate. The subsequent results are shown in Table 64e-1.

This patient presented with hypovolemic hyponatremia and a “prerenal” reduction in GFR, with an increase in serum creatinine. She had experienced diarrhea for some time and manifested an orthostatic tachycardia after a liter of normal saline. As expected for hypovolemic hyponatremia, the urine Na+ concentration was <20 meq/L in the absence of congestive heart failure or other causes of hypervolemic hyponatremia, and she responded to saline hydration with an increase in plasma Na+ concentration and a decrease in creatinine.

The hematocrit was 33.9, white count 7.6, and platelets 405. A morning cortisol was 19.5, with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 1.7. The patient was treated with 1 μg of intravenous DDAVP, along with 75 mL/h of intravenous half-normal saline. After the plasma Na+ concentration dropped to 116 meq/L, intravenous fluid was switched to normal saline at the same infusion rate. The subsequent results are shown in Table 64e-1.

This patient presented with hypovolemic hyponatremia and a “prerenal” reduction in GFR, with an increase in serum creatinine. She had experienced diarrhea for some time and manifested an orthostatic tachycardia after a liter of normal saline. As expected for hypovolemic hyponatremia, the urine Na+ concentration was <20 meq/L in the absence of congestive heart failure or other causes of hypervolemic hyponatremia, and she responded to saline hydration with an increase in plasma Na+ concentration and a decrease in creatinine.

A 66-year-old man was admitted to hospital with a plasma K+ concentration of 1.7 meq/L and profound weakness. The patient had noted progressive weakness over several days, to the point that he was unable to rise from bed. Past medical history was notable for small-cell lung cancer with metastases to brain, liver, and adrenals. The patient had been treated with one cycle of cisplatin/etoposide 1 year before this admission, which was complicated by acute kidney injury (peak creatinine of 5, with residual chronic kidney disease), and three subsequent cycles of cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine, in addition to 15 treatments with whole-brain radiation.

On physical examination, the patient was jaundiced. Blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg, increasing to 160/98 mmHg after 1 L of saline, with a JVP at 8 cm. There was generalized muscle weakness.

Why was this patient hypokalemic? Why was he weak? Why did he have an alkalosis?

This patient suffered from metastatic small-cell lung cancer, which was persistent despite several rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. He presented with profound hypokalemia, alkalosis, hypertension, severe weakness, jaundice, and worsening liver function tests.

Hemodialysis is the most effective and reliable method to reduce plasma K+ concentration; peritoneal dialysis is considerably less effective. Patients with acute kidney injury require temporary, urgent venous access for hemodialysis, with the attendant risks; in contrast, patients with ESRD or advanced chronic kidney disease may have a preexisting venous access. The amount of K+ removed during hemodialysis depends on the relative distribution of K+ between ICF and ECF (potentially affected by prior therapy for hyperkalemia), the type and surface area of the dialyzer used, dialysate and blood flow rates, dialysate flow rate, dialysis duration, and the plasma-to-dialysate K+ gradient.

A 23-year-old woman was admitted with a 3-day history of fever, cough productive of blood-tinged sputum, confusion, and orthostasis. Past medical history included type 1 diabetes mellitus. A physical examination in the emergency department indicated postural hypo-tension, tachycardia, and Kussmaul respiration. The breath was noted to smell of “acetone.” Examination of the thorax suggested consolidation in the right lower lobe.

The diagnosis of the acid-base disorder should proceed in a stepwise fashion: 1.

The normal anion gap (AG) is 8–10 meq/L, but in this case, the AG is elevated (20 meq/L). Therefore, the change in AG (ΔAG) = ~10 meq/L.

The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly.

The plasma Na+ concentration on admission was 113 meq/L, with a creatinine of 2.35 (Table 64e-1). At hospital hour 7, the plasma Na+ concentration was 120 meq/L, potassium 5.4 meq/L, chloride 90 64e-5 meq/L, bicarbonate 22 meq/L, BUN 32 mg/dL, creatinine 2.02 mg/dL, glucose 89 mg/dL, total protein 5.0, and albumin 1.9.

A 32-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with weakness and hypokalemia. The patient had been very healthy until 2 months previously when he developed intermittent leg weakness. His review of systems was otherwise negative. He denied drug or laxative abuse and was on no medications. Past medical history was unremarkable, with no history of neuromuscular disease. Family history was notable for a sister with thyroid disease. Physical examination was notable only for reduced deep tendon reflexes.

This patient developed hypokalemia due to a redistribution of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular compartments; this pathophysiology was readily apparent following calculation of the TTKG. The TTKG is calculated as (P × U )/(P ×

U ). The expected values for the TTKG are <3 in the presence of hypokalemia and >7–8 in the presence of hyperkalemia (see also Case 2 and Case 8). Alternatively, a urinary K+-to-creatinine ratio of >13 mmol/g creatinine (>1.5 mmol/mmol creatinine) is compatible with excessive renal K+ excretion. In this case, the calculated TTKG was 2.5, consistent with appropriate renal conservation of K+ and a nonrenal cause for hypokalemia. In the absence of significant gastrointestinal loss of K+, the patient was diagnosed with a “redistributive” subtype of hypokalemia.

The patient was treated with furosemide, 20 mg PO bid, and salt tablets. The plasma Na+ concentration increased to 129 meq/L with this therapy; however, the patient developed orthostatic hypotension and dizziness. He was started on demeclocycline, 600 mg PO in the morning and 300 mg in the evening, just before discharge from hospital. Plasma Na+ concentration increased to 140 meq/L with a BUN of 23 and creatinine of 1.4, at which point demeclocycline was reduced to 300 mg PO bid. Bronchoscopic biopsy eventually showed small-cell lung cancer; the patient declined chemotherapy and was admitted to hospice.

What factors contributed to this patient’s hyponatremia? What are the therapeutic options?

If the fasting plasma glucose level is less than 126 mg/dL (7 mMol/L) but diabetes is nonetheless suspected, then a standardized oral glucose tolerance test may be done (Table 41–4). The patient should eat nothing after midnight prior to the test day. On the morning of the test, adults are then given 75 g of glucose in 300 mL of water; children are given 1.75 g of glucose per kilogram of ideal body weight. The glucose load is consumed within 5 minutes. Blood samples for plasma glucose are obtained at 0 and 120 minutes after ingestion of glucose. An oral glucose tolerance test is normal if the fasting venous plasma glucose value is less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) and the 2-hour value falls below 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L). A fasting value of 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher or a 2-hour value of greater than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus. Patients with 2-hour value of 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.1 mmol/L) have impaired glucose tolerance.

B. Hemoglobin A1c Measurements

When plasma glucose levels are in the normal range, about 4–6% of hemoglobin A has one or both of the N terminal valines of their beta chains irreversibly glycated by glucose—referred to as hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). The HbA1c fraction is abnormally elevated in people with diabetes with chronic hyperglycemia. Since red cells have a lifespan of up to 120 days, the HbA1c value reflects plasma glucose levels over the preceding 8–12 weeks. In patients who monitor their glucose levels, the HbA1c value provides a valuable check on the accuracy of their monitoring. In patients who do not monitor their glucose levels, HbA1c measurements are essential for adjusting treatment. HbA1c can be used to diagnose diabetes. An HbA1c of 6.5% or greater if confirmed by repeat testing is diagnostic of diabetes. Less than 5.7% is normal, and patients with levels of 5.7–6.4% are considered at high risk for developing diabetes (Table 41–4).

Diastolic murmurs are much less common than systolic murmurs, and should be considered abnormal. Early diastolic murmurs occur when there is regurgitation through the aortic or pulmonary valve. Mid-diastolic murmurs are caused by increased flow (ASD, VSD) or anatomic stenosis across the mitral or tricuspid valves.

Continuous murmurs are heard when there is flow through the entire cardiac cycle and are abnormal with one common exception, the venous hum. A PDA is the most common abnormal continuous murmur. Continuous murmurs can also be heard with coarctation of the aorta when collateral vessels are present.

Normal physiologic or innocent murmurs are common, occurring in at least 80% of normal infants and children, heard most often during the first 6 months of life, from 3 to 6 years of age, and in early adolescence. They have also been called benign, functional, vibratory, and flow murmurs. Characteristic findings of innocent murmurs include the quality of the sound, lack of significant radiation, and significant alteration in the intensity of the murmur with positional changes (Table 139-5). Most important, the cardiovascular history and examination are otherwise normal. The presence of symptoms, including failure to thrive or dysmorphic features, should make one more cautious about diagnosing a normal murmur. Diastolic, holosystolic, late systolic, and continuous (except for the venous hum) murmurs and the presence of a thrill are not normal.

Mild desaturation that is not clinically apparent may be the onlyearly finding in complex congenital heart defects. Comparingpulse oximetry between the right arm and a lower extremity mayallow diagnosis of a ductal dependent lesion in which desaturatedblood flows right to left across a PDA to perfuse the lower body.This is now becoming a routine screening test in newborn infantsto rule out congenital heart disease.

The infant that has a strangulated inguinal hernia will manifest an edematous, tender bulge in the groin, occasionally with over-lying skin changes. The child will eventually develop intestinal obstruction, peritonitis, and systemic toxicity.Usually an incarcerated hernia can be reduced. Occasion-ally this may require light sedation. Gentle pressure is applied on the sac from below in the direction of the internal inguinal ring. Following reduction of the incarcerated hernia, the child may be admitted for observation, and herniorrhaphy is per-formed within the next 24 hours to

As already mentioned, the deaf child makes the transition from crying to cooing and babbling at the usual age of 3 to 5 months. After the sixth month, however, the child becomes much quieter, and the usual repertoire of babbling sounds becomes stereotyped and unchanging, though still uttered with pleasant voice. A more conspicuous failure comes somewhat later, when babbling fails to give way to word formation. Should deafness develop within the first few years of life, the child gradually loses such speech as had been acquired but can be retaught by the lipreading method. Speech, however, is harsh, poorly modulated, and unpleasant, and accompanied by many peculiar squeals and snorting or grunting noises. Social and other acquisitions appear at the expected times in the congenitally deaf child, unlike in the developmentally delayed child. The deaf child seems eager to communicate and makes known all his needs by gesture or pantomime, often very cleverly. The deaf child may attract attention by vivid facial expressions, motions of the lips, nodding, or head shaking. The Leiter performance scale, which makes no use of sounds, will show that intelligence is normal. Deafness can be demonstrated at an early age by careful observation of the child’s responses to sounds and by free-field audiometry, but the full range of hearing cannot be accurately tested before the age of 3 or 4 years. Recording of brainstem auditory evoked potentials and testing of the labyrinths, which are frequently unresponsive in deaf mutes, may be helpful. Early diagnosis is important so as to fit the child with a hearing aid and to begin appropriate language training.

In contrast to the child in whom deafness is the only abnormality, the developmentally delayed child generally talks little but may display a rich personality. Autistic children may also be mute; if they speak, echolalia is prominent and the personal “I” is avoided. Blind children of normal intelligence tend to speak slowly and fail to acquire imitative gestures.

SEE CHAPTER 34.

Intussusception is the “telescoping” of a segment of proximalbowel (the intussusceptum) into downstream bowel (the intussuscipiens). Most cases occur in infants 1 to 2 years old; in this age group, nearly all cases are idiopathic. Viral-induced lymphoidhyperplasia may produce a lead point in these children. In olderchildren, the proportion of cases caused by a pathologic leadpoint increases. In young children, ileocolonic intussusceptionis common; the ileum invaginates into the colon, beginning at ornear the ileocecal valve. When pathologic lead points are present,the intussusception may be ileoileal, jejunoileal, or jejunojejunal.

Available @ StudentConsult.com

An infant with intussusception has sudden onset of crampy abdominal pain; the infant’s knees draw up, and the infant cries out and exhibits pallor with a colicky pattern occurring every 15 to 20 minutes. Feedings are refused. As the intussusception progresses, and obstruction becomes prolonged, bilious vomiting becomes prominent, and the dilated, fatigued intestine generates less pressure and less pain. As the intussuscepted bowel is pulled further and further into the downstream intestine by motility, the mesentery is pulled with it and becomes stretched and compressed. The venous outflow from the intussusceptum is obstructed, leading to edema, weeping of fluid, and congestion with bleeding. Third space fluid losses and “currant jelly” stools result. Another unexpected feature of intussusception is lethargy. Between episodes of pain, the infant is glassy-eyed and groggy and appears to have been sedated. A sausage-shaped mass caused by the swollen, intussuscepted bowel may be palpable in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium.

In knees, buckling may occur, in part, due to weakness of muscles crossing the joint. Mechanical symptoms, such as buckling, catching, or locking, could also signify internal derangement, such as meniscal tears, and need to be evaluated. In the knee, pain with activities requiring knee flexion, such as stair climbing and arising from a chair, often emanates from the patellofemoral compartment of the knee, which does not actively articulate until the knee is bent ~35°.

OA is the most common cause of chronic knee pain in persons over age 45, but the differential diagnosis is long. Inflammatory arthritis is likely if there is prolonged morning stiffness and many other joints are affected. Bursitis occurs commonly around knees and hips. A physical examination should focus on whether tenderness is over the joint line (at the junction of the two bones around which the joint is articulating) or is outside of it. Anserine bursitis, medial and distal to the knee, is an extremely common cause of chronic knee pain that may respond to a glucocorticoid injection. Prominent nocturnal pain in the absence of end-stage OA merits a distinct workup. For hip pain, OA can be detected by loss of internal rotation on passive movement, and pain isolated to an area lateral to the hip joint usually reflects the presence of trochanteric bursitis.

No blood tests are routinely indicated for workup of patients with OA unless symptoms and signs suggest inflammatory arthritis.

Examination of the synovial fluid is often more helpful diagnostically than an x-ray. If the synovial fluid white count is >1000/μL, inflammatory arthritis or gout or pseudogout is likely, the latter two being also identified by the presence of crystals.

FIGURE 157-1 Acute septic arthritis of the sternoclavicular joint.

A man in his forties with a history of cirrhosis presented with a new onset of fever and lower neck pain. He had no history of IV drug use or previous catheter placement. Jaundice and a painful swollen area over his left sternoclavicular joint were evident on physical examination. Cultures of blood drawn at admission grew group B Streptococcus. The patient recovered after treatment with IV penicillin. (Courtesy of Francisco M. Marty, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston; with permission.) common among patients with rheumatoid arthritis and may resemble a flare of the underlying disease.

The usual presentation consists of moderate to severe pain that is uniform around the joint, effusion, muscle spasm, and decreased range of motion. Fever in the range of 38.3–38.9°C (101–102°F) and sometimes higher is common but may not be present, especially in persons with rheumatoid arthritis, renal or hepatic insufficiency, or conditions requiring immunosuppressive therapy. The inflamed, swollen joint is usually evident on examination except in the case of a deeply situated joint such as the hip, shoulder, or sacroiliac joint. Cellulitis, bursitis, and acute osteomyelitis, which may produce a similar clinical picture, should be distinguished from septic arthritis by their greater range of motion and less-than-circumferential swelling. A focus of extraarticular infection, such as a boil or pneumonia, should be sought. Peripheral-blood leukocytosis with a left shift and elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein level are common.

Plain radiographs show evidence of soft-tissue swelling, joint-space widening, and displacement of tissue planes by the distended capsule. Narrowing of the joint space and bony erosions indicate advanced infection and a poor prognosis. Ultrasound is useful for detecting effusions in the hip, and CT or MRI can demonstrate infections of the sacroiliac joint, the sternoclavicular joint, and the spine very well.

Typically degenerative joint disease occurs in synovial joints and the process is called osteoarthritis. In the joints where osteoarthritis occurs the cartilage and bony tissues are usually involved, with limited change within the synovial membrane. The typical findings include reduction in the joint space, eburnation (joint sclerosis), osteophytosis (small bony outgrowths), and bony cyst formation. As the disease progresses the joint may become malaligned, its movement may become severely limited, and there may be significant pain.

The commonest sites for osteoarthritis include the small joints of the hands and wrist, and in the lower limb, the hip and knee are typically affected, though the tarsometatarsal and metatarsophalangeal articulations may undergo similar changes.

The etiology of degenerative joint disease is unclear, but there are some associations, including genetic predisposition, increasing age (males tend to be affected younger than females), overuse or underuse of joints, and nutritional and metabolic abnormalities. Further factors include joint trauma and pre-existing articular disease or deformity.

The histological findings of osteoarthritis consist of degenerative changes within the cartilage and the subchondral bone. Further articular damage worsens these changes, which promote further abnormal stresses upon the joint. As the disease progresses the typical finding is pain, which is usually worse on rising from bed and at the end of a day’s activity. Commonly it is aggravated by the extremes of movement or unaccustomed exertion. Stiffness and limitation of movement may ensue.

Treatment in the first instance includes alteration of lifestyle to prevent pain and simple analgesia. As symptoms progress a joint replacement may be necessary, but although joint replacement appears to be the panacea for degenerative joint disease, it is not without risks and complications, which include infection and failure in the short and long term.

The usual presentation consists of moderate to severe pain that is uniform around the joint, effusion, muscle spasm, and decreased range of motion. Fever in the range of 38.3–38.9°C (101–102°F) and sometimes higher is common but may not be present, especially in persons with rheumatoid arthritis, renal or hepatic insufficiency, or conditions requiring immunosuppressive therapy. The inflamed, swollen joint is usually evident on examination except in the case of a deeply situated joint such as the hip, shoulder, or sacroiliac joint. Cellulitis, bursitis, and acute osteomyelitis, which may produce a similar clinical picture, should be distinguished from septic arthritis by their greater range of motion and less-than-circumferential swelling. A focus of extraarticular infection, such as a boil or pneumonia, should be sought. Peripheral-blood leukocytosis with a left shift and elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein level are common.

Plain radiographs show evidence of soft-tissue swelling, joint-space widening, and displacement of tissue planes by the distended capsule. Narrowing of the joint space and bony erosions indicate advanced infection and a poor prognosis. Ultrasound is useful for detecting effusions in the hip, and CT or MRI can demonstrate infections of the sacroiliac joint, the sternoclavicular joint, and the spine very well.

Anteroposterior and frog-leg radiographs of the hip are usually normal. Ultrasonography may reveal a joint effusion. It is mandatory to rule out septic arthritis in the presence of effusion with a joint aspiration and cell count.

The mainstay of treatment is bed rest and minimal weight bearing until the pain resolves. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication is usually sufficient to decrease pain. Limiting strenuous activity and exercise for 1 to 2 weeks following recovery is helpful. Follow-up will help ensure that there is no deterioration. Lack of improvement necessitates further evaluation for more serious disorders.

Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCPD) is idiopathic avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis) of the capital epiphysis of the femoral head. The etiology is unclear, but it is likely caused by an interruption of the blood supply to the capital femoral epiphysis. There may be an associated hypercoagulability state (factor V Leiden).

LCPD commonly presents in patients 3 to 12 years of age, with a mean age of 7 years. It is four to five times more common in boys.

Patients may not present for several weeks because of minimaldiscomfort; the classic presentation is a child with an atraumatic, painless limp. There may be mild or intermittent hip/groin, anterior thigh, or knee pain. Decreased internal rotationand abduction with some discomfort, thigh muscle spasm, andanterior thigh muscular atrophy may be present. Patients havedelayed bone age.

■The rule of thumb is for low-grade, indolent NHL to be treated with a palliative approach in symptomatic patients, and for high-grade, aggressive NHL to be treated aggressively with a curative approach.

A predominantly B-cell malignancy with an unclear etiology. There is a possible association with EBV. HD has a bimodal age distribution, peaking first in the third decade (primarily the nodular sclerosing type) and then in the elderly at around age 60 (mainly the lymphocyte-depleted type). It has a male predominance in childhood.

HD commonly presents as cervical adenopathy, although it may also present as a mediastinal mass; it is usually found above the diaphragm, with infradiaphragmatic involvement suggesting more widely disseminated disease.

Patients also have systemic B symptoms, pruritus, and hepatosplenomegaly. Pel-Ebstein fevers (1–2 weeks of high fever alternating with 1–2 afebrile weeks) and alcohol-induced pain at nodal sites are rare signs that are specific for HD.

Kernig’s sign (pain on knee extension when the hip is ﬂexed) and Brudzinski’s sign (pain with passive neck ﬂexion) are nonspecific signs of meningeal irritation.

Additional physical exam findings may include signs of ↑ ICP (papilledema, cranial nerve palsies) or petechial rash (N. meningitidis). Signs in neonates include lethargy, hyperor hypothermia, poor tone, a bulging fontanelle, and vomiting.

Head CT to rule out ↑ ICP (risk of brain stem herniation).

Perform an LP; send cell count with differential, glucose and protein levels, Gram stain, and culture.

Empiric antibiotic therapy regimens (ceftriaxone, vancomycin, ampicillin) should be administered until bacterial meningitis can be excluded.

Neonates should receive ampicillin and cefotaxime or gentamicin. Consider acyclovir if there is concern for herpes encephalitis (e.g., if the mother had HSV lesions at the time of the infant’s birth).

Older children should receive ceftriaxone and vancomycin.

A bacterial infection caused by Bordetella pertussis (whooping cough), a grambacillus. The DTaP vaccine (given in five doses in early childhood) is protective, but immunity wanes by adolescence. Adolescents and young adults serve as the primary reservoir for pertussis. Pertussis can be life threatening for young infants but is generally a milder infection in older children and adults.

Has three stages: (1) catarrhal (mild URI symptoms; lasts 1–2 weeks), (2) paroxysmal (paroxysms of cough with inspiratory whoop and post-tussive emesis; lasts 2–3 months), and (3) convalescent (symptoms wane).

Patients most often present in the paroxysmal stage but are most contagious in the catarrhal stage.

The classic presentation is an infant < 6 months of age with post-tussive emesis and apnea.

The age of onset is usually between 15 and 50 years. Blacks, whites, and Asians are equally affected. The dominant nature of the inheritance of von Hippel-Lindau disease is well known. Seizinger and coworkers, in cases associated with renal cell carcinoma and pheochromocytoma, localized a defect in a tumor suppressor gene (termed VHL; see Chap. 37).

The diagnosis can be deduced from the appearance on CT or MRI of a cerebellar cyst containing an enhancing nodular lesion on its wall. Often, the associated retinal hemangioma will be disclosed by the same imaging procedure. The angiographic picture is also characteristic: a cluster of small vessels forming a mass 1.0 to 2.0 cm in diameter (Fig. 30-14). Craniotomy with opening of the cerebellar cyst and excision of the mural hemangioblastomatous nodule is usually curative, but there is a high rate of recurrence if the entire tumor, including the nodule, is not completely removed. In the series of Boughey and colleagues, the lesion was successfully excised in 80 percent of patients; 15 percent of patients, who had only partial resection of an isolated cerebellar lesion, developed recurrent tumors. More recently, several groups have used endovascular embolization of the vascular nodule prior to surgery, but it is not clear if this reduces the incidence of recurrence. Treatment with focused radiation is also being undertaken, particularly for multifocal or surgically inaccessible lesions, and several case series using either stereotactic radiosurgery, or external or proton beam radiation indicate results that may be comparable to conventional treatment.

NHL represents a progressive clonal expansion of B cells, T cells, and/or natural killer (NK) cells stimulated by chromosomal translocations, most commonly t(14,18); by the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes; or by the introduction of exogenous genes by oncogenic viruses (e.g., EBV, HTLV-1, HCV). There is a strong association between H. pylori infection and MALT gastric lymphoma. Most NHLs (almost 85%) are of B-cell origin. NHL is the most common hematopoietic neoplasm and is five times more common than Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

The median patient age is > 50 years, but NHL may also be found in children, who tend to have more aggressive, higher-grade disease. Patient presentation varies with disease grade (see Table 2.7-8).

Excisional lymph node biopsy is necessary for diagnosis; the disease may first present at an extranodal site, which should be biopsied for diagnosis as well.

A CSF exam should be done in patients with HIV, neurologic signs or symptoms, or 1° CNS lymphoma. Disease staging (Ann Arbor classif cation) is based on the number of nodes and on whether the disease crosses the diaphragm.

■Treatment is based on histopathologic classification rather than on stage. Symptomatic patients are treated with radiation and chemotherapy

A subset of patients have a smoldering clinical course and long survival, but most patients present with an aggressive disease manifested by lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, skin infiltration, pulmo nary infiltrates, hypercalcemia, lytic bone lesions, and elevated LDH levels. The skin lesions can be papules, plaques, tumors, and ulcerations. Lung lesions can be either tumor or opportunistic infection in light of the underlying immunodeficiency in the disease. Bone marrow involvement is not usually extensive, and anemia and thrombocytopenia are not usually prominent. Although treatment with combination chemotherapy regimens can result in objective responses, true complete remissions are unusual, and the median survival of patients is ~7 months. A small phase II study reported a high response rate with interferon plus zidovudine and arsenic trioxide.

Anaplastic Large T/Null-Cell Lymphoma Anaplastic large T/null-cell lymphoma was previously usually diagnosed as undifferentiated carcinoma or malignant histiocytosis. Discovery of the CD30 (Ki-1) antigen and the recognition that some patients with previously unclassified malignancies displayed this antigen led to the identification of a new type of lymphoma. Subsequently, discovery of the t(2;5) and the resultant frequent overexpression of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) protein confirmed the existence of this entity. This lymphoma accounts for ~2% of all non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. Table 134-10 shows the clinical characteristics of patients with anaplastic large T/null cell lymphoma.

Sensation in the newborn infant must be judged largely by its motor reactions, so that sensory and motor developments seem to run in parallel but this may be partly artifactual. There are nonetheless discernible maturational stages that constitute sensory milestones, so to speak. This is most apparent in the visual system, which is more easily studied than the other senses. Sustained ocular fixation on an object is observable at term and even in some preterm infants; at these ages it is essentially a reflexive phototropic reaction.

As already mentioned, the deaf child makes the transition from crying to cooing and babbling at the usual age of 3 to 5 months. After the sixth month, however, the child becomes much quieter, and the usual repertoire of babbling sounds becomes stereotyped and unchanging, though still uttered with pleasant voice. A more conspicuous failure comes somewhat later, when babbling fails to give way to word formation. Should deafness develop within the first few years of life, the child gradually loses such speech as had been acquired but can be retaught by the lipreading method. Speech, however, is harsh, poorly modulated, and unpleasant, and accompanied by many peculiar squeals and snorting or grunting noises. Social and other acquisitions appear at the expected times in the congenitally deaf child, unlike in the developmentally delayed child. The deaf child seems eager to communicate and makes known all his needs by gesture or pantomime, often very cleverly. The deaf child may attract attention by vivid facial expressions, motions of the lips, nodding, or head shaking. The Leiter performance scale, which makes no use of sounds, will show that intelligence is normal. Deafness can be demonstrated at an early age by careful observation of the child’s responses to sounds and by free-field audiometry, but the full range of hearing cannot be accurately tested before the age of 3 or 4 years. Recording of brainstem auditory evoked potentials and testing of the labyrinths, which are frequently unresponsive in deaf mutes, may be helpful. Early diagnosis is important so as to fit the child with a hearing aid and to begin appropriate language training.

In contrast to the child in whom deafness is the only abnormality, the developmentally delayed child generally talks little but may display a rich personality. Autistic children may also be mute; if they speak, echolalia is prominent and the personal “I” is avoided. Blind children of normal intelligence tend to speak slowly and fail to acquire imitative gestures.

Cyanosis usually becomes significant within the first 6 to 12 months of life, and the child may develop characteristic “tet” spells, which are periods of extreme hypoxemia. These spells are characterized by decreased pulmonary blood flow and an increase in systemic blood flow. They can be triggered by any stimulus that decreases systemic vascular resistance, such as fever, agitation, or vigorous physical activity. Cyanotic spells increase in severity and frequency as

colors can be matched at 30 months. Perception of form, at least as judged by the length of time spent in looking at different visual presentations, is evident at 2 or 3 months of age (Fantz). At this time infants are attracted more to certain patterns than to colors. At 3 months, most infants have discovered their hands and spend considerable time watching their movements. The ages at which infants begin to observe color, size, shape, and numbers can be determined by means of the Terman-Merrill and Stutzman intelligence tests (see Gibson and Olum).

2023-11-29 14:11:14,846 query: A group of researchers decided to explore whether the estimates of incidence and prevalence rates of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were influenced by the number of years it took to examine administrative data. These estimates were not only based on hospital discharges, but also on physician billing codes. For study purposes, the researchers labeled incident cases at the initial occurrence of SLE diagnosis in the hospital database, while prevalent cases were those that were coded as harboring SLE at any time, with patients maintaining their diagnosis until death. Which statement is true regarding the relationship between incidence and prevalence rates during the time period that might be chosen for this specific study? 

2023-11-29 14:11:14,846 options:  <A> Incidence rates will be higher during shorter time periods than longer periods.. <B> The prevalence of SLE during consecutively shorter time windows will be overestimated.. <C> The inclusion of attack rates would increase incidence estimates in longer time periods.. <D> The inclusion of attack rates would decrease incidence estimates in shorter time periods..

The prevalence of bipolar disease cannot be stated with precision, mainly because of varying criteria used for diagnosis. Certainly depression and depressive episodes are ubiquitous and mania is less common. The apparent increase of the disease in the past 50 years probably reflects a growing awareness of the condition among both physicians and the laity. Studies of large groups of patients from relatively isolated areas of Iceland and the Danish islands of Bornholm and SamsØ indicated that 5 percent of men and 9 percent of women developed symptoms of major depression, mania, or both at some time during their lives (Goodwin and Guze). More recent studies, such as the one conducted by the National Comorbidity Survey, report lifetime prevalence for bipolar disorder in the United States as 4.5 percent (Merikangas et al). According to the Global Burden of Disease Study, the incidence of bipolar disease increased by about 50 percent between 1990 and 2013 but it is still considered rare by comparison to depression and to other medical diseases (Ferrari).

Bipolar disease occurs most frequently in middle and later adult years, with a peak age of onset between 55 and 65 for both sexes. However, a significant proportion of patients experience the first attack in childhood, adolescence, or early adult life. Depression is also a major problem in the elderly. Blazer and Williams, who studied 997 persons older than age 65 years in North Carolina, found symptoms of a major depressive illness in 3.7 percent. The disease was 2 or 3 times more frequent among women. There is no known explanation for this gender difference, but some have speculated that just as many men are depressed, only they deny it or turn to alcohol. Patients in the bipolar group have an earlier age of onset, more frequent and shorter cycles of illness, and a greater prevalence of affective disorder among their relatives than do patients with unipolar depression (Winokur).

parkinson’s Disease and other movement Disorders C. Warren Olanow, Anthony H.V. Schapira, Jose A. Obeso PARKINSON’S DISEASE AND RELATED DISORDERS Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second commonest neurodegenerative 449 disease, exceeded only by Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Its cardinal clinical features were first described by the English physician James Parkinson in 1817. It is noteworthy that James Parkinson was a general physician who captured the essence of this condition based on a visual inspection of a mere handful of patients. It is estimated that approximately 1 million persons in the United States, 1 million in Western Europe, and 5 million worldwide suffer from this disorder. PD affects men and women of all races, all occupations, and all countries. The mean age of onset is about 60 years. The frequency of PD increases with aging, but cases can be seen in patients in their 20s and even younger. Based on the aging of the population and projected demographics, it is estimated that the prevalence of the disease will dramatically increase in the next several decades.

Clinically, PD is characterized by rest tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia (slowing), and gait impairment, known as the “cardinal features” of the disease. Additional features can include freezing of gait, postural instability, speech difficulty, autonomic disturbances, sensory alterations, mood disorders, sleep dysfunction, cognitive impairment, and dementia (Table 449-1).

This rate is expected to increase as the population of aged in the United States increases. One third of sepsis cases occur in surgical pop-ulations and sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality.85 The treatment of sepsis has improved over the last decade, with mortality rates dropping to under 30%.

H. influenzae meningitis, formerly encountered mainly in infants and young children, has been nearly eliminated in this age group as a result of vaccination programs. Noteworthy is the report of Schuchat and colleagues, who found that in 1995, some 5 years after the introduction of the conjugate H. influenzae vaccine, the incidence of bacterial meningitis in the United States had been halved. However, the incidence of meningitis from this organism continues to be common in developing nations, where it is now occurring with increasing frequency in adults.

Meningococcal meningitis occurs most often in children and adolescents but is also encountered throughout much of adult life, with a sharp decline in incidence after the age of 50 years. Pneumococcal meningitis predominates in the very young and in older adults. Perhaps the greatest change in the epidemiology of bacterial meningitis, aside from the one related to H. influenzae vaccination, has been the increasing incidence of nosocomial infections, accounting for 40 percent of cases in large urban hospitals (Durand et al); staphylococcus and gram-negative bacilli account for a large proportion of these.

The yearly incidence rate (per 100,000 population) of the responsible pathogens is approximately as follows:

S. pneumoniae, 1.1; N. meningitidis, 0.6; group B streptococcus (mainly in newborns), 0.3; L. monocytogenes, 0.2; and

H. influenzae, 0.2. In an epidemiologic survey of bacterial meningitis in the United States from 1998 to 2007, Thigpen and colleagues found the relative order of the various organisms to be much the same and again emphasized the decrease in incidence of the disease due mainly to the

H. influenza vaccination program. They estimated the recent overall incidence of bacterial meningitis in the United States to be 4,100 cases annually, resulting in 500 deaths. Their article is recommended for its detailed analysis of age, race, and underlying medical conditions.

Examination of the chest includes inspection of the chest wall to identify asymmetry resulting from absence of the pectoralis muscle and inspection of the breast tissue to determine gestational age and detect a breast abscess. Boys and girls may have breast engorgement and produce milk; milk expression should not be attempted. Supernumerary nipples may be bilateral and may be associated with renal anomalies.

Examination of the lungs includes observations of the rate, depth, and nature of intercostal or sternal retractions. Breath sounds should be equal on both sides of the chest, and rales should not be heard after the first 1 to 2 hours of life. Diminished or absent breath sounds on one side suggest pneumothorax, collapsed lung, pleural effusion, or diaphragmatic hernia. Shift of the cardiac impulse away from a tension pneumothorax and diaphragmatic hernia and toward the collapsed lung is a helpful physical finding for differentiating these disorders. Subcutaneous emphysema of the neck or chest also suggests a pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum, whereas bowel sounds auscultated in the chest in the presence of a scaphoid abdomen suggest a diaphragmatic hernia.

The position of the heart in infants is more midline than in older children. The first heart sound is normal, whereas the second heart sound may not be split in the first day of life. Decreased splitting of the second heart sound is noted in PPHN, transposition of the great vessels, and pulmonary atresia. Heart murmurs in newborns are common in the delivery room and during the first day of life. Most of these murmurs are transient and are due to closure of the ductus arteriosus, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, or a small ventral septal defect. Pulses should be palpated in the upper and lower extremities (over the brachial and femoral arteries). Blood pressure in the upper and lower extremities should be measured in all patients with a murmur or heart failure. An upperto-lower extremity gradient of more than 10 to 20 mm Hg suggests coarctation of the aorta.

The typical age of presentation is 30–50 years, and males predominate. The clinical presentation is usually insidious and is manifested by progressive exertional dyspnea, fatigue, weight loss, and low-grade fever. A nonproductive cough is common, but occasionally expectoration of “chunky” gelatinous material may occur. Polycythemia, hypergammaglobulinemia, and increased LDH levels are common. Markedly elevated serum levels of lung surfactant proteins A and D have been found in PAP. In the absence of any known secondary cause of PAP, an elevated serum anti-GM-CSF titer is highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of acquired PAP. BAL fluid levels of anti-GM-CSF antibodies correlate better with the severity of PAP than do serum titers. Radiographically, bilateral symmetric alveolar opacities located centrally in middle and lower lung zones result in a “bat-wing” distribution. HRCT shows a ground-glass opacification and thickened intralobular structures and interlobular septa.

Histologic Findings This diffuse disease is characterized by the accumulation of an amorphous, periodic acid–Schiff–positive lipoproteinaceous material in the distal air spaces. There is little or no lung inflammation, and the underlying lung architecture is preserved.

Treatment Whole-lung lavage(s) through a double-lumen endotracheal tube provides relief to many patients with dyspnea or progressive hypoxemia and also may provide long-term benefit.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS upper Respiratory Tract Infections and Pneumonia Acute M. pneumoniae infections generally manifest as pharyngitis, tracheobronchitis, reactive airway disease/wheezing, or a nonspecific upper respiratory syndrome. Little evidence supports the commonly held belief that this organism is an important cause of otitis media, with or without bullous myringitis. Pneumonia develops in 3–13% of infected individuals; its onset is usually gradual, occurring over several days, but may be more abrupt. Although Mycoplasma pneumonia may begin with a sore throat, the most common presenting symptom is cough. The cough is typically nonproductive, but some patients produce sputum. Headache, malaise, chills, and fever are noted in the majority of patients.

On physical examination, wheezes or rales are detected in ∼80% of patients with M. pneumoniae pneumonia. In many patients, however, pneumonia can be diagnosed only by chest radiography. The most common radiographic pattern is that of peribronchial pneumonia with thickened bronchial markings, streaks of interstitial infiltration, and areas of subsegmental atelectasis. Segmental or lobar consolidation is not uncommon. While clinically evident pleural effusions are infrequent, lateral decubitus views reveal that up to 20% of patients have pleural effusions.

Overall, the clinical presentation of pneumonia in an individual patient is not useful for differentiating M. pneumoniae pneumonia from other types of community-acquired pneumonia. The possibility of M. pneumoniae infection deserves particular consideration when community-acquired pneumonia fails to respond to treatment with a penicillin or a cephalosporin—antibiotics that are ineffective against mycoplasmas. Symptoms usually resolve within 2–3 weeks after the onset of illness. Although M. pneumoniae pneumonia is generally self-limited, appropriate antimicrobial therapy significantly shortens the duration of clinical illness. Infection uncommonly results in critical illness and only rarely in death. In some patients, long-term recurrent wheezing or reactive airway disease may follow the resolution of acute pneumonia. The significance of chronic infection, especially as it relates to asthma, is an area of active investigation.

Signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary depending on the infecting organism and the patient’s immune status. In typical pneumonias, the usual presentation is a patient with high fever, rigors, productive cough, chills, and pleuritic chest pain. Chest radiography often will show infiltrates (11). The following agents, listed in decreasing order, cause two-thirds of all bacterial pneumonias: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus inﬂuenza, Klebsiella pneumoniae, gram-negative organisms, and anaerobic bacteria. Atypical pneumonias are more insidious in onset than typical pneumonias. Patients have moderate fever without the characteristic rigors and chills. Additional symptoms include a nonproductive cough, headache, myalgias, and mild leukocytosis. Chest radiography reveals bronchopneumonia with a diffuse interstitial pattern; characteristically, the patient does not appear to be as ill as the x-ray suggests. Common causes of atypical pneumonia include viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia pneumoniae (also called the TWAR agent), and other rare agents.

A strong index of suspicion is required for diagnosis, especially in elderly and immunocompromised individuals, who have altered response mechanisms. This is true with “typical agents.” Subtle clues in the elderly include changes in mentation, confusion, and exacerbation of other illnesses. The febrile response may be entirely absent, and the results of the physical examination are not predictive of pneumonia. In high-risk groups, an increased respiratory rate of greater than 25 breaths per minute remains the most reliable sign of infection. Mortality in these high-risk groups of patients is strongly correlated with the ability of the host to mount normal defenses to the symptoms of fever, chills, and tachycardia.

All women suspected of having pneumonia should undergo chest radiography to establish the diagnosis and to detect alternate diagnoses such as congestive heart failure and tumors.

Chest Imaging (See Chap. 308e) Most patients with disease of the respiratory system undergo imaging of the chest as part of the initial evaluation. Clinicians should generally begin with a plain chest radio-graph, preferably posterior-anterior and lateral films. Several findings, including opacities of the parenchyma, blunting of the costophrenic angles, mass lesions, and volume loss, can be very helpful in determining an etiology. However, many diseases of the respiratory system, particularly those of the airways and pulmonary vasculature, are asso ciated with a normal chest radiograph.

CT of the chest is often performed subsequently and allows better delineation of parenchymal processes, pleural disease, masses or nodules, and large airways. If the test includes administration of contrast, the pulmonary vasculature can be assessed with particular utility for determination of pulmonary emboli. Intravenous contrast also allows lymph nodes to be delineated in greater detail.

Depending on the clinician’s suspicion, a variety of other studies may be done. Concern about large-airway lesions may warrant bronchoscopy. This procedure may also be used to sample the alveolar space with bronchoalveolar lavage or to obtain nonsurgical lung biopsies. Blood testing may include assessment for hypercoagulable states in the setting of pulmonary vascular disease, serologic testing for infectious or rheumatologic disease, or assessment of inflammatory markers or leukocyte counts (e.g., eosinophils). Sputum evaluation for malignant cells or microorganisms may be appropriate. An echocardiogram to assess rightand left-sided heart function is often obtained. Finally, at times, a surgical lung biopsy is needed to diagnose certain diseases of the respiratory system. All of these studies will be guided by the preceding history, physical examination, pulmonary function testing, and chest imaging.

Physical Examination Breast tumors, particularly cancerous ones, usually are asymptomatic and are discovered by the patient or through physical examination or screening mammography. Typically, the breast changes slightly during the menstrual cycle. During the premenstrual phase, most women have increased innocuous nodularity and mild engorgement of the breast. Rarely these characteristics can obscure an underlying lesion and make examination difficult. Findings should be carefully documented in the medical record to serve as a baseline for future reference.

Inspection Inspection is performed initially while the patient is seated comfortably with her arms relaxed at her sides. The breasts are compared for symmetry, contour, and skin appearance. Edema or erythema is identified easily, and skin dimpling or nipple retraction is shown by having the patient raise her arms above her head and then press her hands on her hips, thereby contracting the pectoralis muscles (Fig. 21.1). Palpable and even nonpalpable tumors that distort Cooper’s ligaments may lead to skin dimpling with these maneuvers.

Head circumference: Measured routinely in the first two years. ↑ head circumference can indicate hydrocephalus or tumor; ↓ head circumference can point to microcephaly (e.g., TORCH infections).

Height and weight: Measured routinely until adulthood. The pattern of growth is more important than the raw numbers. Infants may lose 5–10% of birth weight (BW) over the first few days but should return to their BW by 14 days. Infants can be expected to double their BW by 4–5 months, triple by one year, and quadruple by two years.

Failure to thrive: Persistent weight less than the 5th percentile for age or “falling off the growth curve” (i.e., crossing two major percentile lines on a growth chart). Classified as follows:

Organic: Due to an underlying medical condition such as cystic fibro-sis, congenital heart disease, celiac sprue, pyloric stenosis, chronic infection (e.g., HIV), and GERD.

Nonorganic: Primarily due to psychosocial factors such as maternal depression, neglect, or abuse.

A careful dietary history and close observation of maternal-infant interactions (especially preparation of formula and feeding) are critical to diagnosis.

Children should be hospitalized if there is evidence of neglect or severe malnourishment. Calorie counts and supplemental nutrition (if breastfeeding is inadequate) are mainstays of treatment.

Tanner staging: Performed to assess physical development in boys and girls. Stage 1 is preadolescent; stage 5 is adult. Increasing stages are assigned for testicular and penile growth in boys and breast growth in girls; pubic hair development is used for both stages.

Girls: The average age of puberty is 10.5 years. Generally the order of progression is thelarche (breast bud development) → pubarche (pubic hair development) → growth spurt → menarche (first menstrual bleeding). The average age of menarche in United States girls is 12.5 years.

The genetic makeup and the physical, emotional, and socialenvironment of the individual determine how a child grows anddevelops throughout childhood. One goal of pediatrics is to helpeach child achieve his or her individual potential through periodically monitoring and screening for the normal progressionor abnormalities of growth and development. The AmericanAcademy of Pediatrics recommends routine office visits in thefirst week of life (depending on timing of nursery discharge) at 2weeks; at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months; at 2, 2½, and3 years;then annually through adolescence/young adulthood (Fig. 9-1).

Deviations in growth patterns may be nonspecific or may be important indicators of serious and chronic medical disorders. An accurate measurement of length/height, weight, and head circumference should be obtained at every health supervision visit and compared with statistical norms on growth charts. Table 5-1 summarizes several convenient benchmarks to evaluate normal growth. Serial measurements are much more useful than single measurements to detect deviations from a particular growth pattern, even if the value remains within statistically defined normal limits (percentiles). Following the trend helps define whether growth is within acceptable limits or warrants further evaluation.

Growth is assessed by plotting accurate measurements on growth charts and comparing each set of measurements withprevious measurements obtained at health visits. Please seeexamples in Figures 5-1 to 5-4. Complete charts can be found at www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/who_charts.htm for birth to 2 years and www.cdc.gov/growthcharts for 2 to 20 years. The body massindex is defined as body weight in kilograms divided by height inmeters squared; it is used to classify adiposity and is recommendedas a screening tool for children and adolescents to identify thoseoverweight or at risk for being overweight (see Chapter 29).

With the patient in the supine position (see Fig. 17-18C) the clinician gently palpates the breasts, making certain to examine all quadrants of the breast from the sternum laterally to the latissimus dorsi muscle and from the clavicle inferiorly to the upper rectus sheath. The examination is per-formed with the palmar aspects of the fingers, avoiding a grasp-ing or pinching motion. The breast may be cupped or molded in the examiner’s hands to check for retraction. A systematic search for lymphadenopathy then is performed. Figure 17-18D shows the position of the patient

No treatment for PMS has been validated by empirical studies (59). Studies of St. John’s wort, possibly the most popular alternative treatment, are contradictory (60). A number of lifestyle changes and other benign interventions alleviate symptoms for some patients with PMS (61):

Elimination of caffeine from the diet

Stress reduction can be accomplished by reducing or delegating responsibilities, insofar as that is possible, and devoting part of every day to relaxation techniques such as meditation and yoga. Many women experience stress factors over which they have no control (59).

For premenstrual dysphoric disorder, several selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) proved effective in clinical trials (62–65). Although SSRIs and all other antidepressants require about 2 weeks of daily administration to achieve therapeutic effect for other depressive disorders, it appears that ﬂuoxetine is effective for PMDD when taken in the usual daily doses for the 1 to 2 weeks preceding menstruation. The medication is packaged for this specific indication and dosage. It is thought that the mode of action of SSRIs when used in this fashion differs from that which alleviates major depression (65). Other medications for the treatment of PMS and PMDD are shown in Table 12.2. There is some interest in the role of oral contraceptives in management of PMDD, and for patients interested in contraception, trials of oral contraceptives are a reasonable approach (66). Symptoms must be carefully monitored to determine whether the hormonal intervention improves or exacerbates the problem mood changes.

Lovastatin and simvastatin are inactive lactone prodrugs that are hydrolyzed in the gastrointestinal tract to the active β-hydroxyl derivatives, whereas pravastatin has an open, active lactone ring. Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, and rosuvastatin are fluorine-containing congeners that are active as given. Absorption of the ingested doses of the reductase inhibitors varies from 40% to 75% with the exception of fluvastatin, which is almost completely absorbed. All have high first-pass extraction by the liver. Most of the absorbed dose is excreted in the bile; 5–20% is excreted in the urine. Plasma half-lives of these drugs range from 1 to 3 hours except for atorvastatin (14 hours), pitavastatin (12 hours), and rosuvastatin (19 hours).

Mechanism of Action

HMG-CoA reductase mediates the first committed step in sterol biosynthesis. The active forms of the reductase inhibitors are structural analogs of the HMG-CoA intermediate (Figure 35–3)

Taxol (paclitaxel) and Taxotere (docetaxel) are anticancer drugs derived from the bark of the western yew. Both are particularly useful in the treatment of ovarian and breast cancer, but they have a wide range of antineoplastic activities. A purely or predominantly sensory neuropathy is a common complication. These drugs are thought to cause neuropathy by their action as inhibitors of the depolymerization of tubulin, thereby promoting excessive microtubule assembly within the axon. The neuropathy is dose-dependent, occurring with doses greater than 200 mg/m2 of paclitaxel and at a wide range of dose levels for docetaxel (generally greater than 600 mg/m2). Symptoms may begin 1 to 3 days following the first dose and affect the feet and hands simultaneously. Autonomic neuropathy (orthostatic hypotension) may occur as well. The neuropathy is axonal in type, with secondary demyelination, and is at least partially reversible after discontinuation of the drug.

This drug, originally synthesized as a MAO inhibitor, is now an important oral agent in the treatment of Hodgkin disease and other tumors. It has also proved to be especially effective in the treatment of oligodendrogliomas. Neural complications are infrequent and usually take the form of somnolence, confusion, agitation, and depression. Diffuse aching pain in proximal muscles of the limbs and mild symptoms and signs of polyneuropathy occur in 10 to 15 percent of patients treated with relatively high doses. A reversible ataxia has also been described. Procarbazine, taken in conjunction with phenothiazines, barbiturates, narcotics, or alcohol, may produce serious degrees of oversedation. Other toxic reactions, such as orthostatic hypotension, are related to its inhibition of MAO.

dosing Warfarin is usually started at a dose of 5–10 mg. Lower doses are used for patients with CYP2C9 or VKORC1 polymorphisms, which affect the pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetics of warfarin and render patients more sensitive to the drug. The dose is then titrated to achieve the desired target INR. Because of its delayed onset of action, patients with established thrombosis or those at high risk for thrombosis are given concomitant initial treatment with a rapidly acting parenteral anticoagulant, such as heparin, LMWH, or fondaparinux. Early prolongation of the INR reflects reduction in the functional levels of factor VII. Consequently, concomitant treatment with the parenteral anticoagulant should be continued until the INR has been therapeutic for at least 2 consecutive days. A minimum 5-day course of parenteral anticoagulation is recommended to ensure that the levels of factor Xa and prothrombin have been reduced into the therapeutic range with warfarin.

Because warfarin has a narrow therapeutic window, frequent coagulation monitoring is essential to ensure that a therapeutic anticoagulant response is maintained. Even patients with stable warfarin dose requirements should have their INR determined every 3–4 weeks. More frequent monitoring is necessary when new medications are introduced because so many drugs enhance or reduce the anticoagulant effects of warfarin.

The student may feel removed from such techniques and experimental procedures because direct experience with them is usually not available in current curricula. Nevertheless, it is important to know something about specialized procedures and the data they yield. This chapter provides a survey of methods and offers an explanation of how the data provided by these methods can help the student acquire a better understanding of cells, tissues, and organ function.

One problem students in histology face is understanding the nature of the two-dimensional image of a histologic slide or an electron micrograph and how the image relates to the three-dimensional structure from which it came. To bridge this conceptual gap, we must first present a brief description of the methods by which slides and electron microscopic specimens are produced.

The routinely prepared hematoxylin and eosin–stained section is the specimen most commonly studied.

The slide set given each student to study with the light microscope consists mostly of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)–stained specimens. Nearly all of the light micrographs in the Atlas section of this book are of slides from actual student sets. Also, most photomicrographs used to illustrate tissues and organs in histology lectures and conferences are taken from such slides. Other staining techniques are sometimes used to demonstrate specific cell and tissue components; several of these methods are discussed below.

The first step in preparation of a tissue or organ sample is fixation to preserve structure.

Fixation, usually by a chemical or mixture of chemicals, permanently preserves the tissue structure for subsequent treatments. Specimens should be immersed in fixative immediately after they are removed from the body. Fixation is used to:  terminate cell metabolism, prevent enzymatic degradation of cells and tissues by autolysis (self-digestion), kill pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses, and  harden the tissue as a result of either cross-linking or dena turing protein molecules.

In the third step, the specimen is stained to permit examination.

Because paraffin sections are colorless, the specimen is not yet suitable for light microscopic examination. To color or stain the tissue sections, the paraffin must be dissolved out, again with xylol or toluol, and the slide must then be rehydrated through a series of solutions of descending alcohol concentration. The tissue on the slides is then stained with hematoxylin in water. Because the counterstain, eosin, is more soluble in alcohol than in water, the specimen is again dehydrated through a series of alcohol solutions of ascending concentration and stained with eosin in alcohol. Figure 1.1 shows the results of staining with hematoxylin alone, eosin alone, and hematoxylin with counterstain eosin. After staining, the specimen is then passed through xylol or toluol to a nonaqueous mounting medium and covered with a coverslip to obtain a permanent preparation.

Formalin does not preserve all cell and tissue components.

Although H&E–stained sections of formalin-fixed specimens are convenient to use because they adequately display general structural features, they cannot elucidate the specific chemical composition of cell components. Also, many components are lost in the preparation of the specimen. To retain these components and structures, other fixation methods must be used. These methods are generally based on a clear understanding of the chemistry involved. For instance, the use of alcohols and organic solvents in routine preparations removes neutral lipids.

To retain neutral lipids, such as those in adipose cells, frozen sections of formalin-fixed tissue and dyes that dissolve in fats must be used; to retain membrane structures, special fixatives

Histochemical and cytochemical procedures may be based on specific binding of a dye, use of a ﬂuorescent dye–labeled antibody with a particular cell component, or the inherent enzymatic activity of a cell component. In addition, many large molecules found in cells can be localized by the process of autoradiography, in which radioactively tagged precursors of the molecule are incorporated by cells and tissues before fixation. Many of these procedures can be used with both light microscopic and electron microscopic preparations.

Before discussing the chemistry of routine staining and histochemical and cytochemical methods, it is useful to examine briefly the nature of a routinely fixed and embedded section of a specimen.

Chemical Composition of Histologic Samples

The chemical composition of a tissue ready for routine staining differs from living tissue.

The components that remain after fixation consist mostly of large molecules that do not readily dissolve, especially after treatment with the fixative. These large molecules, particularly those that react with other large molecules to form macromolecular complexes, are usually preserved in a tissue section. Examples of such large macromolecular complexes include:  nucleoproteins formed from nucleic acids bound to protein,  intracellular cytoskeletal proteins complexed with as sociated proteins,  extracellular proteins in large insoluble aggregates, bound to similar molecules by cross-linking of neighbor ing molecules, as in collagen fiber formation, and  FOLDER 1.1

Bone represents one of the specialized connective tissues. It is characterized by a mineralized extracellular matrix. It is the mineralization of the matrix that sets bone tissue apart from the other connective tissues and results in an extremely hard tissue that is capable of providing support and protection to the body. The mineral is calcium phosphate in the form of hydroxyapatite crystals. In addition to its supporting role, bone also provides a storage site for calcium and phosphate. Both can be mobilized from the bone matrix and taken up by the blood as needed to maintain normal levels. Bone matrix contains type I collagen and, in small amounts, a number of other types of collagen, i.e., types V, III, XI, and XIII. Other matrix proteins that constitute the ground substance of bone such as proteoglycan macromolecules, multiadhesive glycoproteins, growth factors, and cytokines are also present. Bone is typically studied in histological prepara-tions by removing the calcium content of the bone (decalcified bone), thus allowing it to be sectioned like other soft tissues. ORIENTATION MICROGRAPH: The orientation micrograph shows the upper end of a decal-cified humerus from an infant. The interior of the head of the bone, the epiphysis (E), consists of spongy cancellous bone made up of an anastomosing network of trabeculae (T) in the form of spicules of bone tissue. The outer portion consists of a dense layer of bone tissue known as compact bone (CB). Its thickness varies in different parts of the bone. The shaft of this bone, the diaphysis (D), is also made up of compact bone (CB) and in its interior, spongy bone (SB). Also within the shaft of the bone is bone marrow (BM), which at this stage of life is in the form of hemopoetic tissue. Lastly, cartilage is also a component of the bone where it is present as an articular surface (AS) and as a growth plate (GP). The latter is described in a later plate.

The respiratory system can be divided into two components: the lungs and the chest wall. Normally, respiratory system compliance is ~100 mL/cmH2O. Pathophysiologic processes such as pleural effusions, pneumothorax, and increased abdominal girth all reduce chest wall compliance. Lung compliance may be reduced by pneumonia, pulmonary edema, interstitial lung disease, or auto-PEEP. Accordingly, patients with abnormalities in compliance of the respiratory system (lungs and/or chest wall) typically have elevated peak and plateau airway pressures but a normal gradient between these two pressures. Auto-PEEP occurs when there is insufficient time for emptying of alveoli before the next inspiratory cycle. Since the alveoli have not decompressed completely, alveolar pressure remains positive at the end of exhalation (functional residual capacity). This phenomenon results most commonly from critical narrowing of distal airways in disease processes such as asthma and COPD. Auto-PEEP with resulting alveolar overdistention may result in diminished lung compliance, reflected by abnormally increased plateau airway pressures. Modern mechanical ventilators allow breath-to-breath display of pressure and flow, permitting detection of problems such as patient-ventilator dyssynchrony, airflow obstruction, and auto-PEEP (Fig. 321–6).

Oxygen delivery (QO2) is a function of cardiac output and the content of O2 in the arterial blood (CaO2). The CaO2 is determined by the hemoglobin concentration, the arterial hemoglobin saturation, and dissolved O2 not bound to hemoglobin. For normal adults:

QO2 = 50 dL/min × (1.39 × 15 g/dL [hemoglobin concentration] × 1.0 [hemoglobin % saturation] + 0.0031 × 100 [PaO2]) = 50 dL/min (cardiac output) × 21.6 mL O2 per dL blood (CaO2)

hypertrophy of the pulmonary arterioles and fluid in the fetallung increases resistance to blood flow. Pulmonary artery tonealso responds to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acidosis with vasoconstriction, a response that may increase pulmonary vascularresistance further. The ductus arteriosus remains patent in thefetus because of low Pao2 levels and dilating prostaglandins. Inutero, the right ventricle is the dominant ventricle, pumping65% of the combined ventricular output, which is a high volume (450 mL/kg/min) compared with that pumped by an olderinfant’s right ventricle (200 mL/kg/min).

The transition of the circulation, occurring between the fetal and neonatal periods, involves the removal of the low-resistance circulation of the placenta, the onset of breathing, reduction of pulmonary arterial resistance, and closure of in utero shunts. Clamping the umbilical cord eliminates the low-pressure system of the placenta and increases systemic blood pressure. Decreased venous return from the placenta decreases right atrial pressure. As breathing begins, air replaces lung fluid, maintaining the functional residual capacity. Fluid leaves the lung, in part, through the trachea; it is either swallowed or squeezed out during vaginal delivery. The pulmonary lymphatic and venous systems reabsorb the remaining fluid.

The signs of CO2 embolus include sudden and otherwise unexplained hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, cyanosis, and heart murmurs. The end-tidal CO2 level may increase, and findings consistent with pulmonary edema may manifest (103). Accelerating pulmonary hypertension may occur, resulting in right-sided heart failure.

Because gas embolism may result from direct intravascular injection through an insufﬂation needle, the proper placement of the insufﬂation needle must be ensured. Although the initial intraperitoneal pressure may be set at 20 to 30 mm Hg for port placement, it should be maintained at 8 to 12 mm for the rest of the case (104). The risk of CO2 embolus is reduced by careful hemostasis because open venous channels are the portal of entry for gas into the systemic circulation. The anesthesiologist should continuously monitor the patient’s color, blood pressure, heart sounds, heartbeat, and end-tidal CO2 to allow early recognition of the signs of CO2 embolus.

If CO2 embolus is suspected or diagnosed, the surgeon must evacuate the CO2 from the peritoneal cavity and place the patient in the left lateral decubitus position, with the head below the level of the right atrium. A large-bore central venous line should be inserted immediately to allow aspiration of gas from the heart. Because the findings are nonspecific, the patient should be evaluated for other causes of cardiovascular collapse.

Cardiac arrhythmias occur relatively frequently during laparoscopic surgery and are related to a number of factors, the most significant of which are hypercarbia and acidemia.

Early reports of laparoscopy-associated arrhythmia were associated with spontaneous respiration; therefore, most anesthesiologists adopted the practice of mechanical ventilation during laparoscopic surgery. The incidence of hypercarbia is reduced by operating with intraperitoneal pressures at levels less than 12 mm Hg (105).

delivered by cannula or ventilator that has its pumping mechanism turned off; this allows the arterial PCO2 to rise to above 50 or 60 mm Hg (typically, CO2 rises approximately 2.5 mm Hg/min at normal body temperature—slower if the patient is hypothermic). The induced hypercarbia serves both as a stimulus to breathing and confirms that spontaneous ventilation mediated by medullary centers has failed. (Of course, peripheral causes of ventilatory failure such as paralytic drugs should not be present.) If no breathing is observed and blood gases show that an adequate level of PCO2 has been

of PCO2 has been attained, this component of brain death is corroborated. Several sets of formal criteria have incorporated a CO2 concentration of 60 mm Hg (7.98 kPa [kilopascals]) as adequate to stimulate the medulla, even under circumstances in which it has been badly damaged. In our experience, patients who have severely brainstem damage but nonetheless breathe and therefore are not brain dead, have shown this activity at a PCO2 well below 50 mm Hg, but there are exceptions in which higher levels are required as a stimulus.

document (5) 

As a demonstration of destruction of the medulla, it has become customary to perform an “apnea test” to demonstrate unresponsiveness of the medullary centers to a high carbon dioxide tension. This test is conducted by first employing preoxygenation of the lungs for several minutes with high inspired oxygen tension, the purpose of which is to displace nitrogen from the alveoli and create a reservoir of oxygen that will diffuse into the pulmonary circulation. The patient can then be disconnected from the respirator for several minutes, during which time 100 percent oxygen is being delivered by cannula or

Most episodes of fever in children younger than 3 years of age have a demonstrable source of infection elicited by history, physical examination, or a simple laboratory test. In this age group, the most commonly identified serious bacterial infection is a UTI. A blood culture to evaluate for occult bacteremia, and urinalysis and urine culture to evaluate for a UTI, should be considered for all children younger than 3 years of age with fever without localizing signs. Stool culture should be obtained in those with diarrhea marked by blood or mucous. Ill-appearing children should be admitted to the hospital and treated with empirical antibiotics.

Approximately 0.2% of well-appearing febrile children 3 to 36 months of age vaccinated against S. pneumoniae and

No combination of demographic factors (socioeconomic status, race, gender, and age), clinical parameters, or laboratory tests in these children reliably predicts occult bacteremia.

The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?

The drugs described in this chapter are bactericidal inhibitors of protein synthesis that interfere with ribosomal function. These agents are useful mainly against aerobic Gram-negative microorganisms.

The aminoglycosides include streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, sisomicin, netilmicin, and others. They are used most widely in combination with other agents to treat drug-resistant organisms; for example, they are used with a β-lactam antibiotic in serious infections with Gram-negative bacteria, with a β-lactam antibiotic or vancomycin for Gram-positive endocarditis, and with one or more agents for treatment of mycobacterial infections, such as tuberculosis.

General Properties of Aminoglycosides

A 65-year-old man has a history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease with baseline creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL. Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2–3+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?

Abnormalities in fluid volume and electrolyte composition are common and important clinical disorders. Drugs that block specific transport functions of the renal tubules are valuable clinical tools in the treatment of these disorders. Although various agents that increase urine volume (diuretics) have been described since antiquity, it was not until 1937 that carbonic anhydrase inhibitors were first described and not until 1957 that a much more useful and powerful diuretic agent (chlorothiazide) became available.

The primary method used for cancer screening is cervical cytology via Pap smear. The guidelines of the American Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology recommend initiation of cervical cancer screening at age 21, regardless of the age of sexual debut. Women 21–29 years old with a normal Pap smear should have the test repeated every 3 years. Although adolescent and young women often test positive for HPV DNA, they are at very low risk of cervical cancer. Co-testing, or testing for HPV DNA at the time of the Pap smear, is not recommended for women in this age group because the presence of HPV DNA does not correlate with the presence of high-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia. Women 30–65 years of age should have a Pap smear every 3 years if testing for HPV DNA is not performed. The screening interval for women in this age group can be extended to every 5 years if co-testing results are negative. HPV testing is not recommended for partners of women with HPV or for screening for conditions other than cervical cancer.

Currently, there is no clear consensus regarding screening for anal cancer and its precursors, including high-grade anal intraepithelial lesions. This lack of clarity is due to an inadequate understanding of optimal treatment for lowor high-grade anal dysplasia found during cytologic screening. The current HIV treatment guidelines suggest that there may be a benefit to screening, but an effect on the associated morbidity and mortality of anal squamous cell cancer has not been consistently demonstrated.

A variety of treatment modalities are available for various HPV infections, but none has been proven to eliminate HPV from tissue adjacent to the destroyed and infected tissue. Treatment efficacies are limited by frequent recurrences (presumably due to reinfection acquired from an infected partner), reactivation of latent virus, or autoinoculation from nearby infected cells. The goals of treatment include prevention of virus transmission, eradication of premalignant lesions, and reduction of symptoms.

Treatment is generally successful in eliminating visible lesions and grossly diseased tissue. Different therapies are indicated for genital warts, vaginal and cervical disease, and perianal and anal disease.

Screening Women with an intact cervix should undergo routine cytologic screening. Because VAIN is nearly always accompanied by CIN, the Pap test result is likely to be positive when VAIN is present. The vagina should be carefully inspected by colposcopic examination at the time of colposcopy for any CIN lesion. Particular attention should be paid to the upper vagina. Women who have persistent abnormal Pap tests without evident cervical pathology and those with abnormal cytology after treatment of CIN should be examined carefully for VAIN. For women in whom the cervix was removed for high-grade cervical neoplasia, Pap testing should be performed at regular intervals (e.g., yearly), depending on the diagnosis and severity of lesion.

Figure 19.17 Human papillomavirus (HPV)/vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (VAIN 1). Note the surface spicules with partial uptake of Lugol’s stain.

Diagnosis Colposcopic examination and directed biopsy are the mainstays of diagnosis of VAIN. Typically, the lesions are located along the vaginal ridges, are ovoid in shape and slightly raised, and often have surface spicules. VAIN 1 lesions usually are accompanied by a significant amount of koilocytosis, indicating their HPV origin (Fig. 19.17). VAIN 2 exhibits a thicker acetowhite epithelium, a more raised external border, and less iodine uptake (Fig. 19.18A). When VAIN 3 occurs, the surface may become papillary, and the vascular patterns of punctation and mosaic may occur (Fig. 19.18B). Early invasion is typified by vascular patterns similar to those of the cervix.

AIDS. In the cART era this has dropped to close to 2%. CMV retinitis usually presents as a painless, progressive loss of vision. Patients may also complain of blurred vision, “floaters,” and scintillations. The disease is usually bilateral, although typically it affects one eye more than the other. The diagnosis is made on clinical grounds by an experienced ophthalmologist. The characteristic retinal appearance is that of perivascular hemorrhage and exudate. In situations where the diagnosis is in doubt due to an atypical presentation or an unexpected lack of response to therapy, vitreous or aqueous

vitreous or aqueous humor sampling with molecular diagnostic techniques may be of value. CMV infection of the retina results in a necrotic inflammatory process, and the visual loss that develops is irreversible. CMV retinitis may be complicated by rhegmatogenous retinal detachment as a consequence of retinal atrophy in areas of prior inflammation. Therapy for CMV retinitis consists of oral valganciclovir, IV ganciclovir, or IV foscarnet, with cidofovir as an alternative. Combination therapy with ganciclovir and foscarnet has been shown to be slightly more effective than either ganciclovir or foscarnet alone

Myopathy may complicate the course of HIV infection; causes include HIV infection itself, zidovudine, and the generalized wasting syndrome. HIV-associated myopathy may range in severity from an asymptomatic elevation in creatine kinase levels to a subacute syndrome characterized by proximal muscle weakness and myalgias. Quite pronounced elevations in creatine kinase may occur in asymptomatic patients, particularly after exercise. The clinical significance of this 1267 as an isolated laboratory finding is unclear. A variety of both inflammatory and noninflammatory pathologic processes have been noted in patients with more severe myopathy, including myofiber necrosis with inflammatory cells, nemaline rod bodies, cytoplasmic bodies, and mitochondrial abnormalities. Profound muscle wasting, often with muscle pain, may be seen after prolonged zidovudine therapy. This toxic side effect of the drug is dose-dependent and is related to its ability to interfere with the function of mitochondrial polymerases. It is reversible following discontinuation of the drug. Red ragged fibers are a histologic hallmark of zidovudine-induced myopathy.

Ophthalmologic Diseases Ophthalmologic problems occur in ~50% of patients with advanced HIV infection. The most common abnormal findings on funduscopic examination are cotton-wool spots. These are hard white spots that appear on the surface of the retina and often have an irregular edge. They represent areas of retinal ischemia secondary to microvascular disease. At times they are associated with small areas of hemorrhage and thus can be difficult to distinguish from CMV retinitis. In contrast to CMV retinitis, however, these lesions are not associated with visual loss and tend to remain stable or improve over time.

One of the most devastating consequences of HIV infection is CMV retinitis. Patients at high risk of CMV retinitis (CD4+ T cell count <100/μL) should undergo an ophthalmologic examination every 3–6 months. The majority of cases of CMV retinitis occur in patients with a CD4+ T cell count <50/μL. Prior to the availability of cART, this CMV reactivation syndrome was seen in 25–30% of patients with

A major therapeutic advance has occurred with the discovery that exudative macular degeneration can be treated with intraocular injection of antagonists to vascular endothelial growth factor. Bevacizumab, ranibizumab, or aflibercept is administered by direct injection into the vitreous cavity, beginning on a monthly basis. These antibodies cause the regression of neovascular membranes by blocking the action of vascular endothelial growth factor, thereby improving visual acuity.

Central Serous Chorioretinopathy This primarily affects males between the ages of 20 and 50 years. Leakage of serous fluid from the choroid causes small, localized detachment of the retinal pigment epithelium and the neurosensory retina. These detachments produce acute or chronic symptoms of metamorphopsia and blurred vision when the macula is involved. They are difficult to visualize with a direct ophthalmoscope because the detached retina is transparent and only slightly elevated. Optical coherence tomography shows fluid beneath the retina, and fluorescein angiography shows dye streaming into the subretinal space. The cause of central serous chorioretinopathy is unknown. Symptoms may resolve spontaneously if the retina reattaches, but recurrent detachment is common. Laser photocoagulation has benefited some patients with this condition.

Both HSV and varicella zoster virus can cause a rapidly progressing, bilateral necrotizing retinitis referred to as the acute retinal necrosis syndrome, or progressive outer retinal necrosis (PORN). This syndrome, in contrast to CMV retinitis, is associated with pain, keratitis, and iritis. It is often associated with orolabial HSV or trigeminal zoster. Ophthalmologic examination reveals widespread pale gray peripheral lesions. This condition is often complicated by retinal detachment. It is important to recognize and treat this condition with IV acyclovir as quickly as possible to minimize the loss of vision.

Several other secondary infections may cause ocular problems in HIV-infected patients. P. jiroveci can cause a lesion of the choroid that may be detected as an incidental finding on ophthalmologic examination. These lesions are typically bilateral, are from half to twice the disc

If CMV disease is limited to the eye, intravitreal injections of ganciclovir or foscarnet may be considered. Intravitreal injections of cidofovir are generally avoided due to the increased risk of uveitis and hypotony.

Testosterone gels: Advise patients to cover the application sites with a shirt and to wash the skin with soap and water before having skin-to-skin contact, because testosterone gels leave a testosterone residue on the skin that can be transferred to a woman or child who might come in close contact. Serum testosterone levels are maintained when the application site is washed 4–6 h after application of the testosterone gel.

• Testosterone pellets: Look for signs of infection, fibrosis, or pellet extrusion.

BPH is a pathologic process that contributes to the development of lower urinary tract symptoms in men. Such symptoms, arising from lower urinary tract dysfunction, are further subdivided into obstructive symptoms (urinary hesitancy, straining, weak stream, terminal dribbling, prolonged voiding, incomplete emptying) and irritative symptoms (urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, urge incontinence, small voided volumes). Lower urinary tract symptoms and other sequelae of BPH are not just due to a mass effect, but are also likely due to a combination of the prostatic enlargement and age-related detrusor dysfunction.

The symptoms are generally measured using a validated, reproducible index that is designed to determine disease severity and response to therapy—the AUA’s Symptom Index (AUASI), also adopted as the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) (Table 115–2). Serial AUASI is particularly useful in following patients as they are treated with various forms of therapy. Asymptomatic patients do not require treatment regardless of the size of the gland, whereas patients with an inability to urinate, gross hematuria, recurrent infection, or bladder stones may require surgery. In patients with 587 symptoms, uroflowmetry can identify those with normal flow rates who are unlikely to benefit from treatment, and bladder ultrasound can identify those with high postvoid residuals who may need intervention. Pressure-flow (urodynamic) studies detect primary bladder dysfunction. Cystoscopy is recommended if hematuria is documented and to assess the urinary outflow tract before surgery. Imaging of the upper tracts is advised for patients with hematuria, a history of calculi, or prior urinary tract problems.

Basic workup includes a urinalysis and culture to rule out infection. After an informative discussion about the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening, a serum PSA is measured when life expectancy is >10 years and if the diagnosis of prostate can-cer will alter management.23 Other diagnostic testing such as cystoscopy, cytology, postvoid

Newer tests such as the 4K score, prostate health index, and PCA3 are sometimes used to inform the decision to proceed with biopsy. Recently, MRI fusion transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy improved the accu-racy of prostate biopsy.Since most patients survive the disease, risk stratification systems are routinely utilized to guide staging and treatment. Clinical TNM stage, serum PSA levels, and the Gleason grading system are utilized in clinical practice. More recently, genetic testing on biopsy specimen was included in national guidelines.

He finds his work as a computer programmer rewarding and looks forward to coming into the office every day. However, he often falls asleep during meetings even though he usually gets a good night sleep and has limited his exposure to alcohol and caffeine in the evening. His past medical history is noncontributory. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. The primary care provider recommends keeping a sleep journal and provides a questionnaire for the patient’s wife. The patient returns one month later to report no changes to his condition. The sleep journal reveals that the patient is getting sufficient sleep and wakes up rested. The questionnaire reveals that the patient does not snore nor does he stop breathing during his sleep. A sleep study reveals mean sleep latency of 6 minutes. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient’s condition?

slightly, and by all appearances, the individual is dozing. A noise, a touch, or even the cessation of the lecturer’s voice is enough to awaken the patient. The periods of sleep rarely last longer than 15 min unless the patient is reclining, when he may continue to sleep for an hour or longer. At the conclusion of a nap, the patient feels somewhat refreshed. It should be emphasized that there are many narcoleptics who tend to be pervasively drowsy throughout the day. What distinguishes the typical narcoleptic sleep attacks from commonplace postprandial drowsiness and napping

Polysomnography is necessary for the diagnosis of several disorders such as sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and periodic limb movement disorder. A conventional polysomnogram performed in a clinical sleep laboratory allows measurement of sleep stages, respiratory effort and airflow, oxygen saturation, limb movements, heart rhythm, and additional parameters. A home sleep test usually focuses on just respiratory measures and is helpful in patients with a moderate to high likelihood of having obstructive sleep apnea. The multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) is used to measure a patient’s propensity to sleep during the day and can provide crucial evidence for diagnosing narcolepsy and some other causes of sleepiness. The maintenance of wakefulness test is used to measure a patient’s ability to sustain wakefulness during the daytime and can provide important evidence for evaluating the efficacy of therapies for improving sleepiness in conditions such as narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea.

Up to 25% of the adult population has persistent daytime sleepiness that impairs an individual’s ability to perform optimally in school, at work, while driving, and in other conditions that require alertness. Sleepy students often have trouble staying alert and performing well in school, and sleepy adults struggle to stay awake and focused on their work. More than half of Americans have fallen asleep while driving. An estimated 1.2 million motor vehicle crashes per year are due to drowsy drivers, causing about 20% of all serious crash injuries and deaths. One needn’t fall asleep to have an accident, as the inattention and slowed responses of drowsy drivers are a major contributor. Reaction time is equally impaired by 24 h of sleep loss as by a blood alcohol concentration of 0.10 g/dL.

Aside from the frequency and duration criteria required to make the diagnosis, addi- tional criteria are useful to quantify insomnia severity. These quantitative criteria, while arbitrary, are provided for illustrative purpose only. For instance, difficulty initiating sleep is defined by a subjective sleep latency greater than 20—30 minutes, and difficulty maintain~ ing sleep is defined by a subjective time awake after sleep onset greater than 20—30 min- utes. Although there is no standard definition of early-morning awakening, this symptom involves awakening at least 30 minutes before the scheduled time and before total sleep time reaches 61/2 hours. It is essential to take into account not only the final awakening time but also the bedtime on the previous evening. Awakening at 4:00 A.M. does not have the same clinical significance in those who go to bed at 9:00 PM. as in those who go to bed at 1 1:00 PM. Such a symptom may also reﬂect an age-dependent decrease in the ability to sus- tain sleep or an age-dependent shift in the timing of the main sleep period.

Insomnia disorder involves daytime impairments as well as nighttime sleep difficulties.

These include fatigue or, less commonly, daytime sleepiness; the latter is more common among older individuals and when insomnia is comorbid with another medical condition (e.g., chronic pain) or sleep disorder (e.g., sleep apnea). Impairment in cognitive performance may include difficulties with attention, concentration and memory, and even with performing simple manual skills. Associated mood disturbances are typically described as irritability or mood lability and less commonly as depressive or anxiety symptoms. Not all individuals with nighttime sleep disturbances are distressed or have functional impairment. For example, sleep continuity is often interrupted in healthy older adults who nevertheless identify themselves as good sleepers. A diagnosis of insomnia disorder should be reserved for those individuals with significant daytime distress or impairment related to their nighttime sleep difficulties.

Effects of Age

Observations of the human sleep–wake cycle show it to be closely age linked. The newborn baby sleeps from 16 to 20 h a day, and the child, 10 to 12 h. Total sleep time drops to 9 to 10 h by mid-adolescence and to about 7 to 7.5 h during young adulthood. A gradual decline to about 6.5 h develops in late adult life. However, there are wide individual differences in the length and depth of sleep, apparently as a result of genetic factors, early life conditioning, the amount of physical activity, and psychologic states.

The pattern of sleeping, which is adjusted to the 24-h day, also varies in the different epochs of life. The circadian rhythm, with predominance of daytime wakefulness and nighttime sleep, begins to appear only after the first few weeks of postnatal life of the full-term infant; as the child matures, the morning nap is omitted, then the afternoon nap; by the fourth or fifth year, sleep becomes consolidated into a single long nocturnal period. (Actually, a large part of the world’s population continues to have an afternoon nap, or siesta, as a lifelong sleep–wake pattern.) Fragmentation of the sleep pattern begins in late adult life. Over ensuing years, night awakenings tend to increase in frequency, and the daytime waking period may be interrupted by episodic sleep lasting seconds to minutes (microsleep), as well as by longer naps. From about 35 years of age onward, women tend to sleep slightly more than men.

Stages of Sleep

Seminal contributions to our understanding of the physiology of sleep were made by Loomis and associates and by Aserinsky, Dement and Kleitman through electroencephalographic analysis and clinical observation. As a result of their studies, five stages of sleep have been defined. In each stage, the electrical activity of the brain occurs in organized and recurring cycles, referred to as the architecture of sleep. As the electrophysiologic stages of sleep progress, sleep becomes deeper, meaning that arousal requires a more intense stimulus. These findings put to rest the antiquated ideas that sleep is a purely passive state and reflects fatigue and reduction in environmental stimuli.

As a rule, narcolepsy has a gradual onset between the ages of 15 and 35 years; in fully 90 percent of narcoleptics, the condition is established by age 25. Narcolepsy is usually the first symptom, less often cataplexy, and rarely sleep paralysis. The essential disorder is one of frequent attacks of irresistible sleepiness. Several times a day, usually after meals or while sitting in class or in other boring or sedentary situations, the affected person is assailed by an uncontrollable desire to sleep. The eyes close, the muscles relax, breathing deepens slightly, and by all

drowsiness and napping is the frequent occurrence of the former (two to six times every day as a rule), their irresistibility, and their occurrence in unusual situations, as while standing, eating, or carrying on a conversation. Blurring of vision, diplopia, and ptosis may attend the drowsiness and may bring the patient first to an ophthalmologist.

In association with severe pelvic fractures, urethral rupture may occur at the prostatomembranous junction above the deep perineal pouch. The urine will extravasate into the true pelvis.

The worst and most serious urethral rupture is related to serious pelvic injuries where there is complete disruption of the puboprostatic ligaments. The prostate is dislocated superiorly not only by the ligamentous disruption but also by the extensive hematoma formed within the true pelvis. The diagnosis can be made by palpating the elevated prostate during a digital rectal examination.

A 25-year-old man visited his family physician because he had a “dragging feeling” in the left side of his scrotum. He was otherwise healthy and had no other symptoms. During examination, the physician palpated the left testis, which was normal, although he noted soft nodular swelling around the superior aspect of the testes and the epididymis. In his clinical notes, he described these findings as a “bag of worms” (Fig. 5.86). The bag of worms was a varicocele.

The venous drainage of the testis is via the pampiniform plexus of veins that runs within the spermatic cord. A varicocele is a collection of dilated veins that arise from the pampiniform plexus. In many ways, they are similar to varicose veins that develop in the legs. Typically, the patient complains of a dragging feeling in the scrotum and around the testis, which is usually worse toward the end of the day.

The family physician recommended surgical treatment, with a recommendation for surgery through an inguinal incision.

A simple surgical technique divides the skin around the inguinal ligament. The aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle is divided in the anterior abdominal wall to display the spermatic cord. Careful inspection of the spermatic cord reveals the veins, which are surgically ligated.

Another option is to embolize the varicocele.

Testicular torsion Rotation of testicle around spermatic cord and vascular pedicle. Commonly presents in males 12–18 years old. May occur after an inciting event (eg, trauma) or spontaneously. Characterized by acute, severe pain, high-riding testis, and absent cremasteric reflex. Treatment: surgical correction (orchiopexy) within 6 hours, manual detorsion if surgical option unavailable in timeframe. If testis is not viable, orchiectomy. Orchiopexy, when performed, should be bilateral because the contralateral testis is at risk for subsequent torsion.

A 45-year-old man with diabetes mellitus visited his nurse because he had an ulcer on his foot that was not healing despite daily dressings.

Diabetes can lead to vascular disease of large and medium arteries, narrowing the lumen and reducing blood supply to the extremities, thereby impairing healing. In addition, diabetes can also affect blood supply to nerves, which leads to peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy results in reduced sensation, and therefore minor injuries can often go unnoticed.

This patient has developed an ulcer on his heel, which is a pressure point and likely to be under repeated strain. The nurse examined the ulcer and found that the ulcer was looking infected with pus at the base of the ulcer and asked for a specialist orthopedic opinion, who requested an x-ray and an MRI. The MRI and x-ray both demonstrated infection invading into the calcaneus with destruction of the bone (Fig. 6.141A,B).

The patient required surgical washout with removal of the dead and infected bone (debridement) and was given long-term antibiotic treatment (Fig. 6.141C).

A young woman came to a vascular surgeon with a series of large dilated tortuous veins in her right leg. The rest of her leg was otherwise unremarkable.

A diagnosis of varicose veins was made and the surgeon needed to determine the site of valvular incompetence.

There are typical points where incompetent valves occur between the superficial and the deep veins. In these regions the varicosities tend to become marked. The typical sites are: at the saphena varix—the saphenofemoral junction where the femoral vein is joined by the great saphenous vein; in the midthigh perforating vein between the great saphenous vein and the femoral vein; in the calf the three sites where perforators occur, 5, 10, and 15 cm above the medial malleolus between the great saphenous vein and the deep veins of the calf; and at the junction of the small saphenous vein and the popliteal vein.

An urgent surgical procedure was performed.

Burr holes were placed around the region of the hematoma and it was evacuated. The small branch of the middle meningeal artery was ligated and the patient spent a few days in the intensive care unit. Fortunately the patient made an uneventful recovery.

A 35-year-old man was involved in a fight and sustained a punch to the right orbit. He came to the emergency department with double vision.

The double vision was only in one plane.

Examination of the orbits revealed that when the patient was asked to look upward the right eye was unable to move superiorly when adducted. There was some limitation in general eye movement. Assessment of the lateral rectus muscle (abducent nerve [VI]), superior oblique muscle (trochlear nerve [IV]), and the rest of the eye muscles (oculomotor nerve [III]) was otherwise unremarkable.

The patient underwent a CT scan.

A CT scan of the facial bones demonstrated a fracture through the floor of the orbit (Fig. 8.293).

A careful review of this CT scan demonstrated that the inferior oblique muscle had been pulled inferiorly with the fragment of bone in the fracture. This produced a tethering effect, so when the patient was asked to gaze in the upward direction, the left eye was able to do so but the right eye was unable to because of the tethered inferior oblique muscle.

The patient underwent surgical exploration to elevate the small bony fragment and return the inferior oblique to its appropriate position. On follow-up the patient had no complications.

A 25-year-old man complained of significant swelling in front of his right ear before and around mealtimes. This swelling was associated with considerable pain, which was provoked by the ingestion of lemon sweets. On examination he had tenderness around the right parotid region and a hard nodule was demonstrated in the buccal mucosa adjacent to the right upper molar teeth.

A diagnosis of parotid duct calculus was made.

A neck radiograph and coronal CT image of the neck demonstrates a cervical rib (eFig. 3.116).

Cervical ribs may produce three distinct disease entities:

Arterial compression and embolization—the cervical rib (or band) on the undersurface of the distal portion of the subclavian artery reduces the diameter of the vessel and allows eddy currents to form. Platelets aggregate and atheroma may develop in this region. This debris can be dislodged and flow distally within the upper limb vessels to block off blood flow to the fingers and the hand, a condition called distal embolization.

Tension on the T1 nerve—the T1 nerve, which normally passes over rib I, is also elevated by the presence of a cervical rib; thus the patient may experience a sensory disturbance over the medial aspect of the forearm, and develop wasting of the intrinsic muscles of the hand.

Compression of the subclavian vein—this may induce axillary vein thrombosis.

A Doppler ultrasound scan revealed marked stenosis of the subclavian artery at the outer border of the rib with abnormal flow distal to the narrowing. Within this region of abnormal flow there was evidence of thrombus adherent to the vessel wall.

This patient underwent surgical excision of the cervical rib and had no further symptoms.

A 52-year-old man presented with headaches and shortness of breath. He also complained of coughing up small volumes of blood. Clinical examination revealed multiple dilated veins around the neck. A chest radiograph demonstrated an elevated diaphragm on the right and a tumor mass, which was believed to be a primary bronchogenic carcinoma.

By observing the clinical findings and applying anatomical knowledge, the site of the tumor can be inferred.

The multiple dilated veins around the neck are indicative of venous obstruction. The veins are dilated on both sides of the neck, implying that the obstruction must be within a common vessel, the superior vena cava. Anterior to the superior vena cava in the right side of the chest is the phrenic nerve, which supplies the diaphragm. Because the diaphragm is elevated, suggesting paralysis, it is clear that the phrenic nerve has been involved with the tumor.

This is particularly true for penetrating injuries of the neck, thoracic outlet, and groin, where bleeding may be torrential and aris-ing deep within the wound. In these situations, a gloved finger placed through the wound directly onto the bleeding vessel can apply enough pressure to control active bleeding.

E. Thalassemias

The thalassemias are hereditary hemolytic diseases in which an imbalance occurs in the synthesis of globin chains. As a group, they are the most common single-gene disorders in humans. Normally, synthesis of the αand β-globin chains is coordinated, so that each α-globin chain has a βglobin chain partner. This leads to the formation of α2β2 (HbA). In the thalassemias, the synthesis of either the α-or the β-globin chain is defective, and hemoglobin concentration is reduced. A thalassemia can be caused by a variety of mutations, including entire gene deletions, or substitutions or deletions of one of many nucleotides in the DNA. [Note: Each thalassemia can be classified as either a disorder in which no globin chains are produced (α0-or β0-thalassemia), or one in which some chains are synthesized but at a reduced level (α+-or β+-thalassemia).] 1.

document (1) 

Thalassemias are inherited disorders caused by mutations in globin genes that decrease the synthesis of α-or β-globin. Decreased synthesis of one globin results not only in a deficiency of Hb, but also in red cell damage that is caused by precipitates formed from excess unpaired “normal” globin chains. The mutations that cause thalassemia are particularly common in Mediterranean, African, and Asian regions in which malaria is endemic. As with HbS, it is hypothesized that globin mutations associated with thalassemia protect against falciparum malaria.

A diverse collection of α-globin and β-globin mutations underlies the thalassemias, which are autosomal codominant conditions. As described previously, adult hemoglobin, or HbA, is a tetramer composed of two α chains and two β chains. The α chains are encoded by two α-globin http://ebooksmedicine.net

Table 12.3 Clinical and Genetic Classification of Thalassemias genes lying in tandem on chromosome 16, whereas the β chains are encoded by a single β-globin gene located on chromosome 11. The clinical features vary widely depending on the specific combination of mutated alleles that are inherited by the patient (

Table 12.3), as described next.

Mutations associated with β-thalassemia fall into two categories: (1) β0, in which no β-globin chains are produced; and (2) β+ , in which there is reduced (but detectable) β-globin synthesis. Sequencing of β-thalassemia genes has shown more than 100 different causative mutations, a majority consisting of single-base changes. Persons inheriting one abnormal allele have β-thalassemia minor (also known as β-thalassemia trait), which is asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Most people inheriting any two β0 and β+ alleles have β-thalassemia major; occasionally, persons inheriting at least one β+ allele have a milder disease termed β-thalassemia intermedia. In contrast with α-thalassemia (described later), gene deletions rarely underlie β-thalassemia (

Table 12.3

document (2) 

β-Thalassemias: In these disorders, synthesis of β-globin chains is decreased or absent, typically as a result of point mutations that affect the production of functional mRNA. However, α-globin chain synthesis is normal. Excess α-globin chains cannot form stable tetramers and so precipitate, causing the premature death of cells initially destined to become mature RBC. Increase in α2δ2 (HbA2) and α2γ2 (HbF) also occurs. There are only two copies of the β-globin gene in each cell (one on each chromosome 11). Therefore, individuals with β-globin gene defects have either β-thalassemia trait (β-thalassemia minor) if they have only one defective β-globin gene or β-thalassemia major (Cooley anemia) if both genes are defective (Fig. 3.23). Because the β-globin gene is not expressed until late in prenatal development, the physical manifestations of β-thalassemias appear only several months after birth. Those individuals with β-thalassemia minor make some β chains and usually do not require specific treatment. However, those infants born with β-thalassemia major are seemingly healthy at birth but become severely anemic, usually during the first or second year of life, due to ineffective erythropoiesis. Skeletal changes as a result of extramedullary hematopoiesis also are seen. These patients require regular transfusions of blood.

This C → T transition (or G → A on the opposite strand) accounts for at least one-third of point mutations associated with polymorphisms and mutations. In addition to the fact that certain types of mutations (C → T or G → A) are relatively common, the nature of the genetic code also results in overrepresentation of certain amino acid substitutions.

The finding of high levels of serum phenylalanine (above 15 mg/dL) and of phenylpyruvic acid in the blood, CSF, and urine is diagnostic of PKU. The level is normal at birth and rises only after the first few days. But screening by the Guthrie (ferric chloride) test will reliably identify the patient at risk. The addition of 3 to 5 drops of 10 percent ferric chloride to 1 mL of urine is a simple and informative test that was used at the neonates or child’s bedside in the past. It yields an emerald-green color that reaches peak intensity in 3 to 4 min and fades in 20 to 40 min. In contrast, the green-brown color in the urine of patients with histidinemia is permanent. In maple syrup urine disease, the ferric chloride test gives a navy-blue color; propionic and methylmalonic acidemia and either ketones or salicylates in the urine yield a purple color.

The fundamental biochemical abnormality is a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme PA hydroxylase; the failure of conversion of PA to tyrosine results in the excretion of phenylpyruvic acid by affected individuals. The precise step that is faulty in the complex phenylalanine hydroxylating reaction is still unknown.

Pathologic examination shows poor staining of myelin in the cerebral hemispheres. This can be visualized by MRI in untreated children. Another instructive feature is that the pigmented nuclei (substantia nigra, locus ceruleus, dorsal vagal motor) fail to acquire dark coloration because of a block in the production of neuromelanin. Reduction in size of cortical neurons and their dendritic arborizations is said to be demonstrable in some cases.

a. Elevated phenylalanine metabolites: Phenylpyruvate (a phenylketone), phenylacetate, and phenyllactate, which are not normally produced in significant amounts in the presence of functional PAH, are elevated in PKU (Fig. 20.18). These metabolites give urine a characteristic musty (“mousy”) odor.

b.

Central nervous system effects: Severe intellectual disability, developmental delay, microcephaly, and seizures are characteristic findings in untreated PKU. The affected individual typically shows symptoms of intellectual disability by age 1 year and rarely achieves an intelligence quotient (IQ) >50 (Fig. 20.19). [Note: These clinical manifestations are now rarely seen as a result of newborn screening programs, which allow early diagnosis and treatment.] c.

Hypopigmentation: Patients with untreated PKU may show a deficiency of pigmentation (fair hair, light skin color, and blue eyes). The hydroxylation of tyrosine by copper-requiring tyrosinase, which is the first step in the formation of the pigment melanin, is decreased in PKU because tyrosine is decreased.

2.

Newborn screening and diagnosis: Early diagnosis of PKU is important because the disease is treatable by dietary means. Because of the lack of neonatal symptoms, laboratory testing for elevated blood levels of phenylalanine is mandatory for detection. However, the infant with PKU frequently has normal blood levels of phenylalanine at birth because the mother clears increased blood phenylalanine in her affected fetus through the placenta. Normal levels of phenylalanine may persist until the newborn is exposed to 24–48 hours of protein feeding. Thus, screening tests are typically done after this time to avoid false negatives. For newborns with a positive screening test, diagnosis is confirmed through quantitative determination of phenylalanine levels.

3.

document (2) 

To prevent intellectual disability, diagnosis and initiation of dietary treatment of classic phenylketonuria must occur before the child is 2 weeks of age. For this reason, most newborns in North America, Australia, and Europe are screened by determinations of blood phenylalanine levels. Abnormal values are confirmed using quantitative analysis of plasma amino acids. Dietary phenylalanine restriction is usually instituted if blood phenylalanine levels are >360 μmol/L (6 mg/dL). Treatment consists of a special diet low in phenylalanine and supplemented with tyrosine, since tyrosine becomes an essential amino acid in phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. With therapy, plasma phenylalanine concentrations should be maintained between 120 and 360 μmol/L (2 and 6 mg/dL). Dietary restriction should be continued and monitored indefinitely. Some patients with milder forms of phenylketonuria (phenylalanine <1200 μm at presentation) show increased tolerance to dietary proteins and improved metabolic control when treated with tetrahydrobiopterin (5–20 mg/ kg per day), an essential cofactor of phenylalanine hydroxylase.

A number of women with phenylketonuria who have been treated since infancy will reach adulthood and become pregnant. If maternal phenylalanine levels are not strictly controlled before and during pregnancy, their offspring are at increased risk for congenital defects and microcephaly (maternal phenylketonuria). After birth, these children have severe intellectual disability and growth retardation. Pregnancy risks can be minimized by continuing lifelong phenylalanine-restricted diets and assuring strict phenylalanine restriction 2 months prior to conception and throughout gestation.

Some patients with increased concentrations of serum phenylalanine in the neonatal period are unresponsive to measures that lower phenylalanine. They are usually found to have a defect in biopterin metabolism. The defect is usually the result of a mutation in tetrahydrobiopterin or BH4. If this condition is unrecognized and not treated promptly, it leads to seizures of both myoclonic and, later, grand mal types, combined with a poor level of responsiveness and generalized hypotonia. Swallowing difficulty is another prominent symptom. Within a few months, developmental delay becomes prominent. Unlike in PKU, phenylalanine

in PKU, phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme levels are normal, but there is a lack of tetrahydrobiopterin, which is a cofactor of phenylalanine hydroxylase. Treatment consists of administration of tetrahydrobiopterin in a dosage of 7.5 mg/kg/d in combination with a low-phenylalanine diet. It is important to recognize this condition early in life by the measurement of urine pterins and to institute appropriate therapy before irreversible brain injury occurs. A later onset form with diurnally fluctuating dystonia has also been described but its nature is not certain.

Dx: A diagnosis of exclusion. Be particularly aware of giant cell arteritis in patients > 50 years of age with new headaches; always obtain an ESR even if headaches are mild and unassociated with constitutional or vascular symptoms. There are no focal neurologic signs.

Tx: Relaxation, massage, hot baths, and avoidance of exacerbating factors. NSAIDs and acetaminophen are first-line abortive therapy, but trip-tans may also be considered.

The usual etiology involves a suppurative process of the orbit, nasal sinuses, or central face that leads to septic thrombosis of the cavernous sinus. Non-septic thrombosis is rare; S. aureus is the most common causative agent. The syndrome can also be seen with nonbacterial agents, particularly fungi (Mucor or Aspergillus species). Current antibiotics have greatly ↓ both incidence and mortality.

Headache is the most common presenting symptom.

Patients may present with orbital pain, edema, diplopia (2° to oculomotor, abducens, or trochlear nerve involvement), or visual disturbances and may describe a recent history of sinusitis or facial infection. On exam, they typically appear ill and have a fever.

If a 25-year-old male wakes up repeatedly during the night with unilateral periorbital pain associated with ipsilateral lacrimation, think cluster headache.

If a 30-year-old female complains of headaches at the end of the day that worsen with stress and improve with relaxation or massage, think tension-type headache.

Tension-type headaches are the most common type of headache diagnosed in adults.

Additional signs may include red eye, proptosis, ptosis, or ophthalmoplegia of the affected eye (partial or complete). Diminished pupillary constriction (CN III) and/or dilation (Horner’s) may also be present.

Changes in mental status such as confusion, drowsiness, or coma suggest spread to the CNS or sepsis. Late findings include meningismus or systemic signs of sepsis.

This type of inflammatory disease of cranial arteries is an important cause of headache in older persons. All of our patients have been older than 55 years of age, most of them older than age 65. From a state of normal health, the patient develops an increasingly intense throbbing or nonthrobbing headache, often with superimposed sharp, stabbing pains. In a few patients the headache has had an almost explosive onset. The pain is usually unilateral, sometimes bilateral, and often localized to the site of the affected arteries in the scalp. The pain persists to some degree throughout the day and is particularly severe at night. It lasts for many months if untreated. The superficial temporal and other scalp arteries are frequently thickened and tender and without pulsation. Jaw claudication and ischemic nodules on the scalp, with ulceration of the overlying skin, have been described in severe cases.

Many of the patients feel generally unwell and have lost weight; some have a low-grade fever and anemia. Usually the sedimentation rate is greatly elevated (>50 mm/h and typically >75 mm/h) but elevation of the C-reactive protein (CRP) level is a more sensitive indicator of this inflammatory condition and is particularly helpful when the sedimentation rate is only mildly elevated. A few patients have a peripheral neutrophilic leukocytosis. Half of patients have generalized aching of proximal limb muscles, reflecting the presence of polymyalgia rheumatica (see Chap. 45, “Polymyalgia Rheumatica”). A relation of temporal arteritis to herpes zoster has been proposed.

The importance of early diagnosis relates to the threat of blindness from thrombosis of the ophthalmic or posterior ciliary arteries. This may be preceded by several episodes of amaurosis fugax (transient monocular blindness). Ophthalmoplegia may also occur but is less frequent, and its cause, whether neural or muscular, is not settled.

Tx: This is a medical emergency that can cause blindness. Treatment to ↓ IOP may include eyedrops (timolol, pilocarpine, apraclonidine) or systemic medications (oral or IV acetazolamide, IV mannitol). Laser peripheral iridotomy, which creates a hole in the peripheral iris, is curative and may be performed prophylactically.

In the United States, macular degeneration is the leading cause of permanent bilateral visual loss in the elderly.

Risk factors include age > 40 years, African-American ethnicity, diabetes, and myopia.

Hx/PE: Usually asymptomatic until late in the clinical course, when patients may begin to notice visual deficits. Should be suspected in patients > 35 years of age who need frequent lens changes and have mild headaches, visual disturbances, and impaired adaptation to darkness. The earliest visual defect is seen in the peripheral nasal fields. Cupping of the optic nerve head is seen on funduscopic exam.

Dx: Tonometry, ophthalmoscopic visualization of the optic nerve, and visual field testing are most important. A diseased trabecular meshwork obstructs proper drainage of the eye, gradually increasing pressure and leading to progressive vision loss.

Tx: Treat with topical β-blockers (timolol, betaxolol) to ↓ aqueous humor production or with pilocarpine to ↑ aqueous outﬂow. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may also be used. If medication fails, laser trabeculoplasty or a trabeculectomy can improve aqueous drainage.

Laboratory and Imaging Evaluation Patients should have routine blood chemistries and hematologic studies. Specific attention to the platelet count and PT/PTT/INR is important to identify coagulopathy. CT imaging reliably detects acute focal hemorrhages in the supratentorial space. Rarely very small pontine or medullary hemorrhages may not be well delineated because of motion and bone-induced artifact that obscure structures in the posterior fossa. After the first 2 weeks, x-ray attenuation values of clotted blood diminish until they become isodense with surrounding brain. Mass effect and edema may remain. In some cases, a surrounding

some cases, a surrounding rim of contrast enhancement appears after 2–4 weeks and may persist for months. MRI, although more sensitive for delineating posterior fossa lesions, is generally not necessary for primary diagnosis in most instances. Images of flowing blood on MRI scan may identify AVMs as the cause of the hemorrhage. MRI, CT angiography (CTA), and conventional x-ray angiography are used when the cause of intracranial hemorrhage is uncertain, particularly if the patient is young or not hypertensive and the hematoma is not in one of the usual sites for hypertensive hemorrhage.

The presence of a spot sign is associated with an increased risk of hematoma expansion, increased mortality, and lower likelihood of favorable functional outcome. Some centers routinely perform CT with CTA and postcontrast CT at the time of initial imaging to rapidly identify any macrovascular etiology of the hemorrhage and provide prognostic information at the same time.

Important obstetrical aspects of some a-thalassemia syndromes depend on the number of gene deletions in a given woman. he silent carrier state with one gene deletion is of no consequence. Deletion of two genes resulting in a-thalassemia minor is characterized by minimal-to-moderate hypochromic micro cytic anemia. This is due to either .r_ or .+-thalassemia trait, and thus genotypes may be -xla or --la.. Diferentiation is possible only by DNA analysis (Piel, 2014). Because no other clinical abnormalities accompany either form of a-thalassemia minor, it often goes unrecognized and is usually of no maternal consequence (Hanprasertpong, 2013). The fetus with these forms of thalassemia minor will have hemoglobin Bart at birth, but as its levels drop, it is not replaced by hemoglobin H. Red cells are hypochromic and microcytic, and the hemoglobin concentration is normal to slightly depressed.

Hemoglobin H disease (34) results from the compound heterozygous state for .0_ plus .+-thalassemia with deletion of three of four alpha genes (--I-x). With only one functional a-globin gene per diploid genome, the newborn will have abnormal red cells containing a mixture of hemoglobin Bart (14), hemoglobin H (34)' and hemoglobin A. The neonate appears normal but soon develops hemolytic anemia as most of the hemoglobin Bart is replaced by hemoglobin H. In adults, anemia is moderate to severe and usually worsens during pregnancy.

Inheritance of all four abnormal a genes causes homozygous a-thalassemia with predominant production of hemoglobin Bart, which has an appreciably increased ainity for oxygen. This is incompatible with extended survival. Hsieh and colleagues (1989) reported that blood obtained by funipuncture from 20 hydropic fetuses contained 65 to 98 percent Bart hemoglobin. These fetuses are stillborn, or they are hydropic and usually die very soon after birth.

Serum ferritin, ˜g/L

Certain clinical conditions carry an increased likelihood of iron deficiency. Pregnancy, adolescence, periods of rapid growth, and an intermittent history of blood loss of any kind should alert the clini-0 cian to possible iron deficiency. A cardinal rule is that the appearance of iron deficiency in an adult male means gastrointestinal blood loss until proven otherwise. Signs related to iron deficiency depend on the severity and chronicity of the anemia in addition to the usual signs of anemia—fatigue, pallor, and reduced exercise capacity. Cheilosis (fissures at the corners of the mouth) and koilonychia (spooning of the fingernails) are signs of advanced tissue iron deficiency. The diagnosis of iron deficiency is typically based on laboratory results.

clinical manifestations of autosomal dominant disorders may be variable. Because of these variations, it is sometimes challenging to determine the pattern of inheritance.

It should be recognized, however, that some individuals acquire a mutated gene from an unaffected parent. De novo germline mutations occur more frequently during later cell divisions in gametogenesis, which explains why siblings are rarely affected. As noted before, new germline mutations occur more frequently in fathers of advanced age. For example, the average age of fathers with new germline mutations that cause Marfan’s syndrome is ~37 years, whereas fathers who transmit the disease by inheritance have an average age of ~30 years.

autosomal recessive DisorDers In recessive disorders, the mutated alleles result in a complete or partial loss of function. They frequently involve enzymes in metabolic pathways, receptors, or proteins in signaling cascades. In an autosomal recessive disease, the affected individual, who can be of either sex, is a homozygote or compound heterozygote for a single-gene defect. With a few important exceptions, autosomal recessive diseases are rare and often occur in the context of parental consanguinity. The relatively high frequency of certain recessive disorders such as sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, and thalassemia, is partially explained by a selective biologic advantage for the heterozygous state (see below). Although heterozygous carriers of a defective allele are usually clinically normal, they may display subtle differences in phenotype that only become apparent with more precise testing or in the context of certain environmental influences.

A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 36-hour history of lower abdominal pain that was sharp and initially intermittent, later becoming constant and severe. The patient also reported feeling nauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have diarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours before admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative.

On physical examination there was tenderness in the right iliac fossa with guarding. On vaginal examination a tender mass in the right adnexal region was felt. The patient subsequently underwent a transvaginal ultrasound examination for evaluation of adnexal pathology. The scan showed a markedly enlarged right ovary measuring up to 8 cm in long axis with echogenic stroma and peripherally distributed follicles. There was no internal vascularity when color Doppler was applied. A small amount of free fluid was seen in the pouch of Douglas. The diagnosis of ovarian torsion was made.

Ovarian torsion is the twisting of an ovary on its suspensory ligament, which contains arterial, venous, and lymphatic vessels (forming so-called vascular pedicle), leading to a compromised blood supply. Initially, the venous and lymphatic circulation is compromised, resulting in ovarian edema and enlargement. The arterial flow is maintained longer due to thicker and less compressible arterial walls. Prolonged torsion leads to increased internal ovarian pressure that eventually results in arterial thrombosis, ischemia of the ovarian tissue, and necrosis. If the correct diagnosis and treatment are delayed, the patient may develop generalized sepsis.

The symptoms are nonspecific, making the diagnosis of ovarian torsion challenging. There is often no significant past medical history.

Prior to removing the LP needle, the stylet is reinserted to avoid the possibility of entrapment of a nerve root in the dura as the needle is being withdrawn; entrapment could result in a dural CSF leak, causing headache. Some practitioners question the safety of this maneuver, with its potential risk of causing a needle-stick injury to the examiner. Injury is unlikely, however, given the flexibility of the small-diameter stylet, which tends to bend, rather than penetrate, on contact. Following LP, the patient is customarily positioned in a comfortable, recumbent position for 30–60 min before rising, although this may be unnecessary because it does not appear to affect the development of headache (see below).

The principal complication of LP is headache, occurring in 10–30% of patients. Younger age and female gender are associated with an increased risk of post-LP headache. Headache usually begins within 48 h but may be delayed for up to 12 days. Head pain is dramatically positional; it begins when the patient sits or stands upright; there is relief upon reclining or with abdominal compression. The longer the patient is upright, the longer the latency before head pain subsides. The pain is usually a dull ache but may be throbbing; its location is occipitofrontal. Nausea and stiff neck often accompany headache, and occasionally, patients report blurred vision, photophobia, tinnitus, and vertigo. In more than three-quarters of patients, symptoms completely resolve within a week, but in a minority they can persist for weeks or even months.

Post-LP headache is caused by a drop in CSF pressure related to persistent leakage of CSF at the site where the needle entered the SAS. Loss of CSF volume decreases the brain’s supportive cushion, so that when a patient is upright there is probably dilation and tension placed on the brain’s anchoring structures, the pain-sensitive dural sinuses, resulting in pain. Although intracranial hypotension is the usual explanation for severe LP headache, the syndrome can occur in patients with normal CSF pressure.

Table 126-2 lists the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain in children. The urgent task of the clinician is to rule out surgical emergencies. In young children, malrotation with volvulus, incarcerated hernia, congenital anomalies, and intussusception are common concerns. In older children and teenagers, appendicitis is more common. An acute surgical abdomen is characterized by signs of peritonitis, including tenderness, abdominal wall rigidity, guarding, and absent or diminished bowel sounds. Helpful characteristics of onset, location, referral, and quality of pain are noted in Table 126-3.

Recurrent abdominal pain is a common problem, affecting more than 10% of all children. The peak incidence occurs between ages 7 and 12 years. Although the differential diagnosis of recurrent abdominal pain is fairly extensive (Table 126-4),most children do not have a serious (or even identifiable) underlying illness causing the pain.

The classic symptom triad of ectopic pregnancy is pain, amenorrhea, and vaginal bleeding. This symptom group is present in about 50% of patients and is typical in patients with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Abdominal pain is the most common presenting symptom, but the severity and nature of the pain vary widely. There is no pathognomonic pain that is diagnostic of ectopic pregnancy. Pain may be unilateral or bilateral and may occur in the upper or lower abdomen. The pain may be dull, sharp, or crampy and either continuous or intermittent. With rupture, the patient may experience transient relief of the pain, as stretching of the tubal serosa ceases. Shoulder and back pain, thought to result from hemoperitoneal irritation of the diaphragm, may indicate intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

Physical Examination The physical examination should include measurements of vital signs and examination of the abdomen and pelvis. Frequently, the findings before rupture and hemorrhage are nonspecific, and vital signs are normal. The abdomen may be nontender or mildly tender, with or without rebound. The uterus may be slightly enlarged, with findings similar to a normal pregnancy (103,104). Cervical motion tenderness may or may not be present. An adnexal mass may be palpable in up to 50% of cases, but the mass varies markedly in size, consistency, and tenderness. A palpable mass may be the corpus luteum and not the ectopic pregnancy. With rupture and intra-abdominal hemorrhage, the patient develops tachycardia followed by hypotension. Bowel sounds are decreased or absent. The abdomen is distended, with marked tenderness and rebound tenderness. Cervical motion tenderness is present. Frequently, the findings of the pelvic examination are inadequate because of pain and guarding.

History and physical examination may or may not provide useful diagnostic information. The accuracy of the initial clinical evaluation is less than 50% (105). Additional tests are frequently required to differentiate early viable intrauterine pregnancy or suspected ectopic or abnormal intrauterine pregnancy.

IBS is a disorder that affects all ages, although most patients have their first symptoms before age 45. Older individuals have a lower reporting frequency. Women are diagnosed with IBS two to three times as often as men and make up 80% of the population with severe IBS. As indicated in Table 352-1, pain or abdominal discomfort is a key symptom for the diagnosis of IBS. These symptoms should be improved with defecation and/or have their onset associated with a change in frequency or form of stool. Painless diarrhea or constipation does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria to be classified as IBS. Supportive symptoms that are not part of the diagnostic criteria include defecation straining, urgency or a feeling of incomplete bowel movement, passing mucus, and bloating.

Abdominal Pain According to the current IBS diagnostic criteria, abdominal pain or discomfort is a prerequisite clinical feature of IBS. Abdominal pain in IBS is highly variable in intensity and location. It is frequently episodic and crampy, but it may be superimposed on a background of constant ache. Pain may be mild enough to be ignored or it may interfere with daily activities. Despite this, malnutrition due to inadequate caloric intake is exceedingly rare with IBS. Sleep deprivation is also unusual because abdominal pain is almost uniformly present only during waking hours. However, patients with severe IBS frequently wake repeatedly during the night; thus, nocturnal pain is a poor discriminating factor between organic and functional bowel disease. Pain is often exacerbated by eating or emotional stress and improved by passage of flatus or stools. In addition, female patients with IBS commonly report worsening symptoms during the premenstrual and menstrual phases.

Bowel sounds are hypoactive and are substantially decreased with peritonitis related to a ruptured diverticular abscess. Abdominal examination reveals distention with left lower quadrant tenderness on direct palpation and localized rebound tenderness. Abdominal and bimanual rectovaginal examinations may reveal a poorly mobile, doughy inﬂammatory mass in the left lower quadrant. Leukocytosis and fever are common. Stool guaiac may be positive as a result of inﬂammation of the colon or microperforation.

CT with and without contrast is an important adjunct to history and physical examination (30). It will reveal a swollen, edematous bowel and can rule out an abscess. A barium enema is contraindicated. Diverticulitis is initially managed medically with intravenous administration of ﬂuids, strict restriction of oral intake, and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. A diverticular abscess, obstruction, fistula, or perforation requires general surgical intervention.

Intestinal Obstruction The most common causes of intestinal obstruction in women are postsurgical adhesions, hernia formation, inﬂammatory bowel disease, or carcinoma of the bowel or ovary.

Intestinal obstruction is heralded by the onset of colicky abdominal pain followed by abdominal distention, vomiting, constipation, and obstipation. Higher and more acute obstruction results in early vomiting. Colonic obstruction presents with a greater degree of abdominal distention and obstipation. Vomiting first consists of gastric contents, followed by bile, then material with feculent odor, depending on the level of obstruction.

Fever is often present in the late stages. At the onset of mechanical obstruction, bowel sounds are high pitched and maximal during an episode of colicky pain. As the obstruction progresses, bowel sounds decrease and, when absent, suggest ischemic bowel. Marked abdominal distention often ensues.

In specialty clinical settings, approximately 80% of individuals with major NCD due to also frequent at the mild NCD stage of impairment. These symptoms are as or more dis- tressing than cognitive manifestations and are frequently the reason that health care is sought. At the mild NCD stage or the mildest level of major NCD, depression and / or ap- athy are often seen. With moderately severe major NCD, psychotic features, irritability, agitation, combativeness, and wandering are common. Late in the illness, gait distur- bance, dysphagia, incontinence, myoclonus, and seizures are observed.

The prevalence of overall dementia (major NCD) rises steeply with age. In high—income countries, it ranges from 5% to 10% in the seventh decade to at least 25% thereafter. US.

census data estimates suggest that approximately 7% of individuals diagnosed with Alz- heimer’s disease are between ages 65 and 74 years, 53% are between ages 75 and 84 years, and 40% are 85 years and older. The percentage of dementias attributable to Alzheimer’s disease ranges from about 60% to over 90%, depending on the setting and diagnostic cri- teria. Mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease is likely to represent a substantial fraction of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well.

Major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease progresses gradually, sometimes with brief plateaus, through severe dementia to death. The mean duration of survival after di-

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer’s Disease 613 agnosis is approximately 10 years, reﬂecting the advanced age of the majority of individ- uals rather than the course of the disease; some individuals can live with the disease for as long as 20 years. Iate-stage individuals are eventually mute and bedbound. Death most commonly results from aspiration in those who survive through the full course. In mild

NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease, impairments increase over time, and functional status gradually declines until symptoms reach the threshold for the diagnosis of major NCD.

The withdrawal symptoms typically begin when blood concentrations of alcohol decline sharply (i.e., within 4—12 hours) after alcohol use has been stopped or reduced. Reﬂecting the relatively fast metabolism of alcohol, symptoms of alcohol withdrawal usually peak in inten- sity during the second day of abstinence and are likely to improve markedly by the fourth or fifth day. Following acute withdrawal, however, symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, and auto- nomic dysfunction may persist for up to 3—6 months at lower levels of intensity.

Fewer than 10% of individuals who develop alcohol withdrawal will ever develop dra- matic symptoms (e.g., severe autonomic hyperactivity, tremors, alcohol withdrawal delir- ium). Tonic-clonic seizures occur in fewer than 3% of individuals.

Although confusion and changes in consciousness are not core criteria for alcohol with- drawal, alcohol withdrawal delirium (see ”Delirium” in the chapter "Neurocognitive Dis- orders”) may occur in the context of withdrawal. As is true for any agitated, confused state, regardless of the cause, in addition to a disturbance of consciousness and cognition, with- drawal delirium can include visual, tactile, or (rarely) auditory hallucinations (delirium tre- mens). When alcohol withdrawal delirium develops, it is likely that a clinically relevant medical condition may be present (e.g., liver failure, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding, sequelae of head trauma, hypoglycemia, an electrolyte imbalance, postoperative status).

It is estimated that approximately 50% of middle-class, highly functional individuals with alcohol use disorder have ever experienced a full alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Among individuals with alcohol use disorder who are hospitalized or homeless, the rate of al- cohol withdrawal may be greater than 80%. Less than 10% of individuals in withdrawal ever demonstrate alcohol withdrawal delirium or withdrawal seizures.

Acute alcohol withdrawal occurs as an episode usually lasting 4—5 days and only after extended periods of heavy drinking. Withdrawal is relatively rare in individuals younger than 30 years, and the risk and severity increase with increasing age.

myoclonus, and tremors are common. Severe cases can include cranial nerve palsies, hemiparesis, and seizures. Patients often report dysuria and may have viral antigen in urine as well as pyuria. The overall rate of lethality is generally ~7% but may reach 20% among patients >60 years of age. Recovery is slow. Emotional lability, difficulties with concentration and memory, asthenia, and tremors are commonly prolonged in older convalescent patients.

In some cases, the presentation is fulminant, with sepsis and brain edema; papilledema at presentation is unusual and suggests another diagnosis (e.g., an intracranial lesion). Focal signs, including cranial nerve palsies (IV, VI, VII), can be seen in 10–20% of cases; 50–70% of patients have bacteremia.

Disease severity increases with age. St. Louis encephalitis virus infections that result in aseptic meningitis or mild encephalitis are concentrated among children and young adults, while severe and fatal cases primarily affect the elderly. Infection rates are similar in all age groups; thus the greater susceptibility of older persons to disease is a biologic consequence of aging.

A sense of unreality

Fear of going crazy or dying

Chills or hot ﬂashes The attacks can recur with or without specific precipitating events (148). The patient is preoccupied with them and makes behavioral changes she hopes will avert future attacks: avoiding specific situations, assuring herself there is an escape route from certain situations, or refusing to be alone.

The symptoms of panic attacks are often confused with the symptoms of cardiac or pulmonary disease. They lead to many fruitless trips to the emergency department and to costly, even invasive, medical investigations. A careful history can establish the correct diagnosis in most cases (153–155).

Agoraphobia Agoraphobia is the avoidance of situations in which the patient fears she may be trapped, such as the center of a row in the theater or driving over a bridge. She fears that such a situation will trigger anxiety or a panic attack and therefore tends more and more to stay at home or limit her sphere of activity to an increasingly short list of venues. Agoraphobia and panic disorder can occur separately or together (150–154).

Specific Phobias Specific phobias are irrational fears of certain objects or situations, although the patient recognizes that the object or situation poses no real danger. Of particular concern in gynecology are fear of needles and fear of vomiting (150).

Social phobia causes the patient to fear and avoid situations in which the patient anticipates, without rational cause, that she will be perceived in a humiliating light. Such situations include giving a business-related presentation, making an announcement at a meeting, and having a casual dinner with friends. Patients may alter their lives to avoid these anxieties, interfering with their interpersonal relationships and their ability to carry out their responsibilities, or they may manage to carry on despite considerable psychological pain (150).

In this state, patients are overwhelmed by an intense and irrational fear of some animal, object, social situation, or disease. Although acknowledging that there are no grounds for a particular fear (hence it is not a delusion) and that such provocative stimuli are for the most part innocuous, the patient is nonetheless powerless to suppress it. This disorder was known to Hippocrates, who drew a distinction between normal and morbid fears. Westphal, in 1871, was the first to give morbid fears the status of a disease.

Unlike an anxiety attack, a phobia focuses on a specific object or situation. The patient is chronically fearful of a particular animal or situation and becomes extremely anxious or panic stricken and incapacitated when placed in a situation that evokes the phobia. These situations are avoided at all costs. As a result, it may be impossible for the patient to leave the house or neighborhood unaccompanied or at all, mingle in a crowd, walk across a bridge, or travel by air. This fear of being in places or situations from which escape might be difficult or extremely embarrassing is spoken of as agoraphobia. (Agoraphobia, however, is a secondary feature of other psychiatric disorders, the most frequent being anxiety with panic attacks as already mentioned.) The most common phobia—and one that is not disabling for the most part—is claustrophobia, the fear of being confined in a close space such as an elevator or a magnetic resonance scanner. Other phobias are those of open (agoraphobia), closed, or high places, dogs, cats, insects, dirt, sprays and other contaminants, air travel, HIV, cancer, insanity, and death. Feelings of helplessness, pessimism, and despondency, the hallmarks of a depressive illness, result after years of phobic suffering. Often there are obsessive-compulsive tendencies as well, and some patients are hypochondriacal. Phobias are essentially obsessive fears and are somehow allied with this latter category of neurosis. The present authors have observed a number of patients whose phobic (or obsessive- compulsive) states became greatly exaggerated as an endogenous depression developed. Recovery from the depression returned them to their earlier and milder phobic state.

document (2) 

The amount of fear experienced may vary with proximity to the feared situation and may occur in anticipation of or in the actual presence of the agoraphobic situation. Also, the fear or anxiety may take the form of a full— or limited-symptom panic attack (i.e., an ex- pected panic attack). Fear or anxiety is evoked nearly every time the individual comes into contact with the feared situation (Criterion C). Thus, an individual who becomes anxious only occasionally in an agoraphobic situation (e.g., becomes anxious when standing in line on only one out of every five occasions) would not be diagnosed with agoraphobia. The in- dividual actively avoids the situation or, if he or she either is unable or decides not to avoid it, the situation evokes intense fear or anxiety (Criterion D). Active avoidance means the in- dividual is currently behaving in ways that are intentionally designed to prevent or min- imize contact with agoraphobic situations. Avoidance can be behavioral (e.g., changing daily routines, choosing a job nearby to avoid using public transportation, arranging for food delivery to avoid entering shops and supermarkets) as well as cognitive (e.g., using distraction to getthrough agoraphobic situations) in nature. The avoidance can become so severe that the person is completely homebound. Often, an individual is better able to con- front a feared situation when accompanied by a companion, such as a partner, friend, or health professional.

The fear, anxiety, or avoidance must be out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the agoraphobic situations and to the sociocultural context (Criterion E). Differentiating clinically significant agoraphobic fears from reasonable fears (e.g., leaving the house dur- ing a bad storm) or from situations that are deemed dangerous (e.g., walking in a parking lot or using public transportation in a high-crime area) is important for a number of reasons.

As a rule, anorexia nervosa begins shortly after puberty—sometimes later, but seldom after 30 years of age. Some of the patients were overweight in childhood, especially in the prepubertal period. Dieting is much talked about and may have been encouraged, especially by mothers who want their daughters to be more attractive. In epochs such as the current one, where dieting and female thinness are considered normative and desirable, the illness seems to be more common and lesser but transient forms of the disorder are rampant in high school-and college-age young women. Sometimes there appears to be a precipitating event, such as leaving home, disruption of family life, or other stress. Whatever the provocation, it leads to an obsessive refusal to eat. What is more important, the abnormal eating habits persist even when the patient has become painfully thin, and when counseled to eat normally she will use every artifice to starve herself. Food is hidden instead of being eaten, vomiting may be provoked after a meal, or the bowel may be emptied by laxatives. The patient shows no concern about her obvious emaciation and remains active. If left alone, these patients waste away, and approximately 5 percent have succumbed to some intercurrent infection or other medical complication, placing it among the most lethal of psychiatric conditions.

One is struck with the degree of emaciation; it exceeds that of most of the known wasting diseases. Often 30 percent or more of the body weight will have been lost by the time the patient’s family insists on medical consultation. Bradycardia and hypotension are indicators for hospitalization. A fine lanugo covers the face, body, and limbs. The skin is thin and dry, without its normal elasticity, and the nails are brittle. The dental enamel is eroded. Pubic hair and breast tissue (except for loss of fat) are normal, and, in this respect, anorexia nervosa is unlike hypopituitary cachexia (Simmonds disease). Surprisingly, however, there are no neurologic signs of nutritional deficiency. The patient is alert and cheerfully indifferent to her condition. Any suggestion that she is unattractively thin or seriously depleted is rejected.

The cardiovascular system is the system mainly affected in an individual who has lost a large quantity of blood. Arterial systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressures decrease, and the arterial pulse is rapid and feeble. The cutaneous veins collapse, and they fill slowly when compressed centrally. The skin is pale, moist, and slightly cyanotic. Respiration is rapid but may be shallow or deep.

Course of Arterial Blood Pressure Changes

Cardiac output decreases as a result of blood loss. The amount of blood removed when it is donated is approximately 10% of total blood volume; its removal is well tolerated, and mean arterial blood pressure changes little. This is not the case when greater amounts are lost from the circulation. The changes in Pa evoked by acute hemorrhage are illustrated in

Fig. 19.19 . If sufficient blood is rapidly withdrawn to decrease Pa to 50 mm Hg, the pressure then tends to rise spontaneously toward the control level over the next 20 or 30 minutes. In some individuals (curve A in

Fig. 19.20 ), the pressure rises initially after the cessation of hemorrhage. The pressure then begins to decline, and it continues to fall at an accelerating rate until death ensues. This progressive deterioration in cardiovascular function is termed hemorrhagic shock. At some time after the hemorrhage, the deterioration in the cardiovascular system becomes irreversible. A lethal outcome in patients with hemorrhagic shock can be prevented only temporarily by any known therapy, including massive transfusions of donor blood.

Sensory Intensity A modified Borg scale or visual analogue scale can be utilized to measure dyspnea at rest, immediately following exercise, or on recall of a reproducible physical task, such as climbing the stairs at home. An alternative approach is to gain a sense of the patient’s disability by inquiring about what activities are possible. These methods indirectly assess dyspnea and may be affected by nonrespiratory factors, such as leg arthritis or weakness. The Baseline Dyspnea Index and the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire are commonly used tools for this purpose.

Affective Dimension For a sensation to be reported as a symptom, it must be perceived as unpleasant and interpreted as abnormal. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that air hunger evokes a stronger affective response than does increased effort or work of breathing. Some therapies for dyspnea, such as pulmonary rehabilitation, may reduce breathing discomfort, in part, by altering this dimension.

Central respiratory depression (e.g., anesthesia, sedation, or coma) 244 few minutes, is productive of benign-appearing mucoid sputum, and generally does not cause discomfort. Cough may occur in the context of other respiratory symptoms that together point to a diagnosis; for example, cough accompanied by wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness after exposure to a cat or other sources of allergens suggests asthma. At times, however, cough is the dominant or sole symptom of disease, and it may be of sufficient duration and severity that relief is sought. The duration of cough is a clue to its etiology. Acute cough (<3 weeks) is most commonly due to a respiratory tract infection, aspiration, or inhalation of noxious chemicals or smoke. Subacute cough (3–8 weeks in duration) is a common residuum of tracheobronchitis, as in pertussis or “postviral tussive syndrome.” Chronic cough (>8 weeks) may be caused by a wide variety of cardiopulmonary diseases, including those of inflammatory, infectious, neoplastic, and cardiovascular etiologies. When initial assessment with chest examination and radiography is normal, cough-variant asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, nasopharyngeal drainage, and medications (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) are the most common causes of chronic cough.

Details as to the sound, the time of occurrence during the day, and the pattern of coughing infrequently provide useful etiologic clues. Regardless of cause, cough often worsens upon first lying down at night, with talking, or with the hyperpnea of exercise; it frequently improves with sleep. An exception may involve the cough that occurs only with certain allergic exposures or exercise in cold air, as in asthma. Useful historical questions include what circumstances surround the onset of cough, what makes the cough better or worse, and whether or not the cough produces sputum.

Disorders can also be grouped according to gas exchange abnormalities, including hypoxemic, hypercarbic, or combined impairment. However, many diseases of the lung do not manifest as gas exchange abnormalities.

As with the evaluation of most patients, the approach to a patient with disease of the respiratory system begins with a thorough history and a focused physical examination. Many patients will subsequently undergo pulmonary function testing, chest imaging, blood and sputum analysis, a variety of serologic or microbiologic studies, and diagnostic procedures, such as bronchoscopy. This stepwise approach is discussed in detail below.

HISTORY Dyspnea and Cough The cardinal symptoms of respiratory disease are dyspnea and cough (Chaps. 47e and 48). Dyspnea has many causes, some of which are not predominantly due to lung pathology. The words a patient uses to describe shortness of breath can suggest certain etiologies for dyspnea. Patients with obstructive lung disease often complain of “chest tightness” or “inability to get a deep breath,” whereas patients with congestive heart failure more commonly report “air hunger” or a sense of suffocation.

The tempo of onset and the duration of a patient’s dyspnea are likewise helpful in determining the etiology. Acute shortness of breath is usually associated with sudden physiologic changes, such as laryngeal edema, bronchospasm, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, or pneumothorax. Patients with COPD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) experience a gradual progression of dyspnea on exertion, punctuated by acute exacerbations of shortness of breath. In contrast, most asthmatics have normal breathing the majority of the time with recurrent episodes of dyspnea that are usually associated with specific triggers, such as an upper respiratory tract infection or exposure to allergens.

MUCUS HYPERSECRETION Increased mucus secretion contributes to the viscid mucous plugs that occlude asthmatic airways, particularly in fatal asthma. There is hyperplasia of submucosal glands that are confined to large airways and of increased numbers of epithelial goblet cells. IL-13 induces mucus hypersecretion in experimental models of asthma.

NEURAL REGULATION Various defects in autonomic neural control may contribute to AHR in asthma, but these are likely to be secondary to the disease, rather than primary defects. Cholinergic pathways, through the release of acetylcholine acting on muscarinic receptors, cause bronchoconstriction and may be activated reflexly in asthma.

predominant nonproductive cough (cough-variant asthma). There 1675 may be no abnormal physical findings when asthma is under control.

The diagnosis of asthma is usually apparent from the symptoms of variable and intermittent airways obstruction, but must be confirmed by objective measurements of lung function.

Lung Function Tests Simple spirometry confirms airflow limitation with a reduced FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, and PEF (Fig. 309-6). Reversibility is demonstrated by a >12% and 200-mL increase in FEV1 15 min after an inhaled short-acting β2-agonist or in some patients by a 2to 4-week trial of oral corticosteroids (OCS) (prednisone or prednisolone 30–40 mg daily). Measurements of PEF twice daily may confirm the diurnal variations in airflow obstruction. Flow-volume loops show reduced peak flow and reduced maximum expiratory flow. Further lung function tests are rarely necessary, but whole-body plethysmography shows increased airway resistance and may show increased total lung capacity and residual volume. Gas diffusion is usually normal, but there may be a small increase in gas transfer in some patients.

Pneumonia Pneumonia is the most common serious pneumococcal syndrome and is considered invasive when associated with a positive blood culture. Pneumococcal pneumonia can present as a mild community-acquired infection at one extreme and as a life-threatening disease requiring intubation and intensive support at the other.

presenting manifestations The presentation of pneumococcal pneumonia does not reliably distinguish it from pneumonia of other etiologies. In a subset of cases, pneumococcal pneumonia is recognized at the outset as associated with a viral upper respiratory infection and is characterized by the abrupt onset of cough and dyspnea accompanied by fever, shaking chills, and myalgias. The cough evolves from nonpurulent to productive of sputum that is purulent and sometimes tinged with blood. Patients may describe stabbing pleuritic chest pain and significant dyspnea indicating involvement of the parietal pleura. Among the elderly, the presenting clinical symptoms may be less specific, with confusion or malaise but without fever or cough. In such cases, a high index of suspicion is required because failure to treat pneumococcal pneumonia promptly in an elderly patient is likely to result in rapid evolution of the infection, with increased severity, morbidity, and risk of death.

findings on pHysical examination The clinical signs associated with pneumococcal pneumonia among adults include tachypnea (>30 breaths/min) and tachycardia, hypotension in severe cases, and fever in most cases (although not in all elderly patients). Respiratory signs are varied, including dullness to percussion in areas of the chest with significant consolidation, crackles on auscultation, reduced expansion of the chest in some cases as a result of splinting to reduce pain, bronchial breathing in a minority of cases, pleural rub in occasional cases, and cyanosis in cases with significant hypoxemia. Among infants with severe pneumonia, chest wall indrawing and nasal flaring are common. Nonrespiratory findings can include upper abdominal pain if the diaphragmatic pleura is involved as well as mental status changes, particularly confusion in elderly patients.

Signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary depending on the infecting organism and the patient’s immune status. In typical pneumonias, the usual presentation is a patient with high fever, rigors, productive cough, chills, and pleuritic chest pain. Chest radiography often will show infiltrates (11). The following agents, listed in decreasing order, cause two-thirds of all bacterial pneumonias: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus inﬂuenza, Klebsiella pneumoniae, gram-negative organisms, and anaerobic bacteria. Atypical pneumonias are more insidious in onset than typical pneumonias. Patients have moderate fever without the characteristic rigors and chills. Additional symptoms include a nonproductive cough, headache, myalgias, and mild leukocytosis. Chest radiography reveals bronchopneumonia with a diffuse interstitial pattern; characteristically, the patient does not appear to be as ill as the x-ray suggests. Common causes of atypical pneumonia include viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia pneumoniae (also called the TWAR agent), and other rare agents.

A strong index of suspicion is required for diagnosis, especially in elderly and immunocompromised individuals, who have altered response mechanisms. This is true with “typical agents.” Subtle clues in the elderly include changes in mentation, confusion, and exacerbation of other illnesses. The febrile response may be entirely absent, and the results of the physical examination are not predictive of pneumonia. In high-risk groups, an increased respiratory rate of greater than 25 breaths per minute remains the most reliable sign of infection. Mortality in these high-risk groups of patients is strongly correlated with the ability of the host to mount normal defenses to the symptoms of fever, chills, and tachycardia.

All women suspected of having pneumonia should undergo chest radiography to establish the diagnosis and to detect alternate diagnoses such as congestive heart failure and tumors.

Children and adolescents were affected for the most part, the disease rarely appearing beyond the age of 10 years. Typically, there is a history of primary measles infection at a very early age, often before 2 years, followed by a 6to 8-year asymptomatic period. The illness evolved in several stages. Initially there was a decline in proficiency at school, temper outbursts and other changes in personality, difficulty with language, and loss of interest in usual activities. These soon give way to a severe and progressive intellectual deterioration in association with focal or generalized seizures, widespread myoclonus, ataxia, and sometimes visual disturbances caused by progressive chorioretinitis. As the disease advances, rigidity, hyperactive reflexes, Babinski signs, progressive unresponsiveness, and signs of autonomic dysfunction appear. In the final stage, the child lies insensate, virtually “decorticated.”

The course is usually steadily progressive, death occurring within 1 to 3 years. A series of 39 such adult cases from India with mean age of 21 years was reported by Prashanth and coworkers, the oldest patient a 43-year-old. The main features were similar in most ways to childhood cases, except that several had visual disturbances and two had extrapyramidal features, raising the possibility of prion disease. Myoclonus was present early in the illness in 26 and developed later in all cases; the movements were described as “slow,” a characteristic alluded to in other series. In two cases that occurred in pregnant women, blurred vision and weakness of limbs was followed by akinetic mutism, without a trace of myoclonus or cerebellar ataxia. Nevertheless, the progressive ataxic-myoclonic chronic dementia in a child is so typical that bedside diagnosis was usually possible.

Any transverse blockage of the m¨ullerian system will cause amenorrhea (59). Such outﬂow obstructions include imperforate hymen, transverse vaginal septum, and absence of the cervix or vagina. Transverse blockage of the outﬂow tract with an intact endometrium frequently causes cyclic pain without menstrual bleeding in adolescents. The blockage of blood ﬂow can cause hematocolpos, hematometra, or hemoperitoneum, and endometriosis.

Mayer-Rokitansky-K¨uster-Hauser syndrome includes vaginal agenesis with variable m¨ullerian duct abnormalities accompanied in some cases by renal, skeletal, and auditory abnormalities (60). M¨ullerian agenesis accounts for approximately 10% of cases of primary amenorrhea (2). Of the patients with this syndrome, 15% have an absent, pelvic, or horseshoe kidney, 40% have a double urinary collecting system, and 5% to 12% have skeletal abnormalities(61–63).Mayer-Rokitansky-K¨uster-Hausersyndrome isassociated with abnormal galactose metabolism (64).

Absence of Functioning Endometrium

Amenorrhea may occur if there is no functioning endometrium. When the findings of the physical examination are normal, anatomic abnormalities of the uterine cavity should be considered. A congenitally absent endometrium is a rare finding in patients with primary amenorrhea.

The patient is unable to repeat the sentence said to him on whisper testing. When a vibrating tuning fork is placed in the middle of the patient's forehead, it is heard equally on both ears.

These principles form the basis for several simple tests of auditory function. In the Weber test, the vibrating fork is applied to the forehead in the midline (or to a central incisor). A normal person hears the bone-conducted sound equally in both ears. In nerve deafness, the sound is localized to the normal ear for the reasons noted previously; in conductive deafness, the sound is perceived as louder in the affected ear because interference from ambient sounds is muted on the affected side. In the Rinne test, the fork is applied to the mastoid process. At the moment the patient indicates that the sound ceases, the fork is held at the auditory meatus. In middle ear deafness, the sound cannot be heard by air conduction after bone conduction has ceased (abnormal Rinne test). In nerve deafness, the reverse may be true (normal Rinne test), but more saliently, both air and bone conduction are quantitatively decreased. The Schwabach test consists of comparing the patient’s bone conduction with that of the normal examiner.

In general, early sensorineural deafness is characterized by a partial loss of perception of high-pitched sounds and conductive deafness by a partial loss of low-pitched sounds. This can be ascertained by the use of tuning forks of different frequencies but most accurately by the use of an audiometer and the construction of an audiogram, which reveals the entire range of hearing at a glance. The audiogram is an essential test in the evaluation of hearing loss and the point of departure for subsequent diagnostic evaluation. A ticking watch (infrequently found on doctor’s wrists or pockets any longer) or rubbing the patient’s hair together near the ear can be used as a surrogate test of gross hearing for the bedside, but these maneuvers emit mostly high-frequency sound and will not detect low-frequency conductive loss.

A cochlear type of hearing loss can be recognized by the presence of the symptoms of recruitment and diplacusis. Recruitment refers to a heightened perception of loudness once the threshold for hearing has been exceeded; thus the patient’s retort “You don’t have to shout” when the examiner raises his voice (see the following text).

document (1) 

The Rinne and Weber tuning fork tests, with a 512-Hz tuning fork, are used to screen for hearing loss, differentiate conductive from sensorineural hearing losses, and confirm the findings of audiologic evaluation. The Rinne test compares the ability to hear by air conduction with the ability to hear by bone conduction. The tines of a vibrating tuning fork are held near the opening of the external auditory canal, and then the stem is placed on the mastoid process; for direct contact, it may be placed on teeth or dentures. The patient is asked to indicate whether the tone is louder by air conduction or bone conduction. Normally, and in the presence of sensorineural hearing loss, a tone is heard louder by air conduction than by bone conduction; however, with conductive hearing loss of ≥30 dB (see “Audiologic Assessment,” below), the bone-conduction stimulus is perceived as louder than the air-conduction stimulus. For the Weber test, the stem of a vibrating tuning fork is placed on

With a unilateral conductive hearing loss, the tone is perceived in the affected ear. With a unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, the tone is perceived in the unaffected ear. A 5-dB difference in hearing between the two ears is required for lateralization.

LABORATORY ASSESSMENT OF HEARINg Audiologic Assessment The minimum audiologic assessment for hearing loss should include the measurement of pure tone air-conduction and bone-conduction thresholds, speech reception threshold, word recognition score, tympanometry, acoustic reflexes, and acoustic-reflex decay.

differentiation of a sensory (cochlear) from a neural (retrocochlear) hearing loss is indicated.

document (2) 

A major and often overlooked element of therapy comes from chemosensory testing itself. Confirmation or lack of conformation of loss is beneficial to patients who come to believe, in light of unsupportive family members and medical providers, that they may be “crazy.” In cases where the loss is minor, patients can be informed of the likelihood of a more positive prognosis. Importantly, quantitative testing places the patient’s problem into overall perspective. Thus, it is often therapeutic for an older person to know that, while his or her smell function is not what it used to be, it still falls above the average of his or her peer group. Without testing, many such patients are simply told they are getting old and nothing can be done for them, leading in some cases to depression and decreased self-esteem.

Disorders of Hearing

Anil K. Lalwani

Hearing loss is one of the most common sensory disorders in humans and can present at any age. Nearly 10% of the adult population has some hearing loss, and one-third of individuals age >65 years have a hearing loss of sufficient magnitude to require a hearing aid.

The function of the external and middle ear is to amplify sound to facilitate conversion of the mechanical energy of the sound wave into an electrical signal by the inner ear hair cells, a process called mechanotransduction (Fig. 43-1). Sound waves enter the external auditory canal and set the tympanic membrane (eardrum) in motion, which in turn moves the malleus, incus, and stapes of the middle ear. Movement of the footplate of the stapes causes pressure changes in the fluid-filled inner ear, eliciting a traveling wave in the basilar membrane of the cochlea. The tympanic membrane and the ossicular chain in the middle ear serve as an impedance-matching mechanism, improving the efficiency of energy transfer from air to the fluid-filled inner ear.

document (3) 

Deafness is of three general types: (1) Conductive deafness, caused by a defect in the mechanism by which sound is transformed (amplified) and conducted to the cochlea. These are disorders of the external or middle ear—obstruction of the external auditory canal by atresia or cerumen, thickening of the tympanic membrane from infection or trauma, chronic otitis media, otosclerosis (the main cause of deafness in early adult life), and obstruction of the eustachian tube. (2) Sensorineural deafness (also called, imprecisely, nerve deafness), which is caused by disease of the cochlea or of the cochlear division of the eighth cranial nerve. Although cochlear and eighth nerve causes of deafness have conventionally been combined in one (sensorineural) category, the neurologist recognizes that the symptoms and causes of the two are quite different and that it is more practical to think of them as cochlear (end organ) and retrocochlear (nerve) deafness. (3) Central deafness, caused by lesions of the cochlear nuclei and their connections with the primary auditory receptive areas in the temporal lobes. For example, complete tone deafness, which is probably inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, is a central disorder.

The two peripheral forms of deafness—conductive and sensorineural deafness—must be distinguished from each other, because important remedial measures are available, particularly for the former. In differentiating them, the tuning-fork tests are often of value. When a vibrating fork, preferably of 512-Hz frequency, is held about 2.5 cm from the ear (test for air conduction), sound waves can be appreciated only as they are transmitted through the middle ear; they will be reduced with disease in this location. When the vibrating fork is applied to the skull (test for bone conduction), the sound waves are conveyed directly to the cochlea, without intervention of the sound-transmission apparatus of the middle ear, and will therefore not be reduced or lost in outer or middle ear disease. Normally air conduction is better than bone conduction, and the sound transmitted though the air is appreciated for about twice as long as that passing through the bone.

Full-term newborns in a quiet awake state follow human faces,lights in a dark room, or large, opticokinetic strips. Visual acuity has been estimated to be 20/200 in newborns and 20/20 in6-month-old infants. Standard visual charts displaying picturesinstead of letters can be used to assess visual acuity in toddlers.Peripheral vision is tested by surreptitiously bringing objectsinto the visual field from behind. A reduced pupillary reactionto light suggests anterior visual pathway lesions, including theretina, optic nerves, and chiasm. Unilateral optic nerve lesionsare identified by the swinging flashlight test. With an optic nerveabnormality, both pupils constrict when light is directed into thenormal eye. When light is swung over to the abnormal eye, bothpupils dilate inappropriately; this is called an afferent pupillary defect or Marcus Gunn pupil. Interruption of the sympatheticinnervation to the pupil produces Horner’s syndrome (ptosis,miosis, and unilateral facial anhidrosis). In this instance, anisocoria (unequal pupils) is more pronounced in a dark room,because the affected pupil is unable to dilate appropriately.Lesions of the posterior visual pathway, including the lateralgeniculate, optic radiations, and occipital cortex, have normalpupillary light reactions but are expressed by loss of visual fields.

Cranial Nerves III, IV, and VI

These three cranial nerves control eye movement and are most easily examined with the use of a colorful toy to capture the child’s attention. For infants too young to fix and follow, rotating the infant’s head assesses oculocephalic vestibular reflexes (doll’s eye maneuver). If the brainstem is intact, rotating a newborn or comatose patient’s head to the right causes the eyes to move to the left, and vice versa. In awake, older patients, voluntary eye movements mask the reflex.

Occurs when the iris dilates and pushes against the lens of the eye, disrupting ﬂow of aqueous humor into the anterior chamber. Pressure in the posterior chamber then pushes the peripheral iris forward and blocks the angle.

Risk factors include family history, older age, Asian ethnicity, hyperopia, prolonged pupillary dilation (prolonged time in a dark area, stress, medications), anterior uveitis, and lens dislocation.

Hx/PE: Classically presents with extreme eye pain, blurred vision, headache, nausea, and vomiting. A hard, red eye is seen (from acute closure of a narrow anterior chamber angle); the pupil is dilated and nonreactive to light. IOP is ↑. If it resolves spontaneously prior to presentation (e.g., with pupillary constriction in sunlight), ophthalmologic examination may reveal narrow angles in one or both eyes.

Dx: Diagnosis is based on clinical history and examination. Those that resolve may mimic a migraine headache with blurred vision; the distinction is that the headaches and blurred vision are more likely to be triggered by darkness (due to pupillary dilation) rather than by bright lights (migraine).

Partial paralysis of facial muscles that dates from birth and cannot be attributed to obstetric trauma is not infrequent. In a common type, the lower lip on one side remains immobile when the child smiles or cries; the lip on the unaffected side is drawn downward and outward, resulting in a prominent asymmetry of the lower face. Often it is not appreciated that the side that droops during crying is the normal side (Hoefnagel and Penry).

Congenital Lack of Lateral Gaze

Children with this congenital defect are unable to turn their eyes to either side volitionally or on command. Attempting to look to the right, the child turns the head to the right (there is no associated apraxia of head turning), but the eyes lag and turn to the left. As a result, the patient has to overshoot the mark with the head in order to attain ocular fixation. Once the eyes fixate, the head returns to the primary position. To compensate for the deficiency of eye movements, the patient develops jerky thrusting movements of the head, which characterize all attempts at voluntary gaze. Caloric stimulation of the labyrinth causes tonic movement of the eyes but not nystagmus, as in the normal person. Also, optokinetic nystagmus cannot be induced. Vertical eye movements are normal. A similar ocular condition may occur in conjunction with ataxia-telangiectasia and in Gaucher disease. Children with oculomotor apraxia are slow to walk; Ford observed one such child whose sibling had an absence of the vermis of the cerebellum. Aside from this observation, the anatomic basis of the condition has not been studied.

Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca Also known as dry eye, this produces a burning foreign-body sensation, injection, and photophobia. In mild cases the eye appears surprisingly normal, but tear production measured by wetting of a filter paper (Schirmer strip) is deficient. A variety of systemic drugs, including antihistaminic, anticholinergic, and psychotropic medications, result in dry eye by reducing lacrimal secretion. Disorders that involve the lacrimal gland directly, such as sarcoidosis and Sjögren’s syndrome, also cause dry eye. Patients may develop dry eye after radiation therapy if the treatment field includes the orbits. Problems with ocular drying are also common after lesions affecting cranial nerve V or VII. Corneal anesthesia is particularly dangerous, because the absence of a normal blink reflex exposes the cornea to injury without pain to warn the patient. Dry eye is managed by frequent and liberal application of artificial tears and ocular lubricants. In severe cases the tear puncta can be plugged or cauterized to reduce lacrimal outflow.

Keratitis Keratitis is a threat to vision because of the risk of corneal clouding, scarring, and perforation. Worldwide, the two leading causes of blindness from keratitis are trachoma from chlamydial infection and vitamin A deficiency related to malnutrition. In the United States, contact lenses play a major role in corneal infection and ulceration. They should not be worn by anyone with an active eye infection. In evaluating the cornea, it is important to differentiate between a superficial infection (keratoconjunctivitis) and a deeper, more serious ulcerative process. The latter is accompanied by greater visual loss, pain, photo-phobia, redness, and discharge. Slit-lamp examination shows disruption of the corneal epithelium, a cloudy infiltrate or abscess in the

Fracture dislocations are treated operatively with surgical stabilization.Disc HerniationDisc herniation, most common between ages of 20 and 50, can occur in the cervical, thoracic, or the lumbar spine, and consists of a tear of the annulus allowing the nucleus pulposus material to extrude through the annulus and enter the canal, pressing on the exiting nerve or the “traversing” nerve roots. In the cervical spine, spinal cord compression can occur.Symptoms of most disc herniations resolve within 8 weeks

hAm (TropicAL spAsTic pArApAresis) In contrast to ATL, in which there is a slight predominance of male patients, HAM affects female patients disproportionately. HAM resembles multiple sclerosis in certain ways (Chap. 458). The onset is insidious. Symptoms include weakness or stiffness in one or both legs, back pain, and urinary incontinence. Sensory changes are usually mild, but peripheral neuropathy may develop. The disease generally takes the form of slowly progressive and unremitting thoracic myelopathy; one-third of patients are bedridden within 10 years of diagnosis, and one-half are unable to walk unassisted by this point. Patients display spastic paraparesis or paraplegia with hyperreflexia, ankle clonus, and extensor plantar responses. Cognitive function is usually spared; cranial nerve abnormalities are unusual.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals lesions in both the white matter and the paraventricular regions of the brain as well as in the spinal cord. Pathologic examination of the spinal cord shows symmetric degeneration of the lateral columns, including the corticospinal tracts; some cases involve the posterior columns as well. The spinal meninges and cord parenchyma contain an inflammatory infiltrate with myelin destruction.

A lumbar spine MRI scan or CT myelogram is necessary to establish the location and type of pathology. Spine MRIs yield exquisite views of intraspinal and adjacent soft tissue anatomy. Bony lesions of the lateral recess or intervertebral foramen are optimally visualized by CT myelography. The correlation of neuroradiologic findings to symptoms, particularly pain, is not simple. Contrast-enhancing tears in the annulus fibrosus or disk protrusions are widely accepted as common sources of back pain; however, studies have found that many asymptomatic adults have similar findings. Asymptomatic disk protrusions are also common and may enhance with contrast. Furthermore, in patients with known disk herniation treated either medically or surgically, persistence of the herniation 10 years later had no relationship to the clinical outcome. In summary, MRI findings of disk protrusion, tears in the annulus fibrosus, or hypertrophic facet joints are common incidental findings that, by themselves, should not dictate management decisions for patients with back pain.

The diagnosis of nerve root injury is most secure when the history, examination, results of imaging studies, and the EMG are concordant. The correlation between CT and EMG for localization of nerve root injury is between 65 and 73%. Up to one-third of asymptomatic adults have a lumbar disk protrusion detected by CT or MRI scans.

Management of lumbar disk disease is discussed below.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT:

Symptoms and signs of ataxia consist of gait impairment, unclear (“scanning”) speech, visual blurring due to nystagmus, hand incoordination, and tremor with movement. These result from the involvement of the cerebellum and its afferent and efferent pathways, including the spinocerebellar pathways, and the frontopontocerebellar pathway originating in the rostral frontal lobe. True cerebellar ataxia must be distinguished from ataxia associated with vestibular nerve or labyrinthine disease, as the latter results in a disorder of gait associated with a significant degree of dizziness, light-headedness, or the perception of movement (Chap. 28). True cerebellar ataxia is devoid of these vertiginous complaints and is clearly an unsteady gait due to imbalance. Sensory disturbances can also on occasion simulate the imbalance of cerebellar disease; with sensory ataxia, imbalance dramatically worsens when visual input is removed (Romberg sign). Rarely, weakness of proximal leg muscles mimics cerebellar disease. In the patient who presents with ataxia, the rate and pattern of the development of cerebellar symptoms help to narrow the diagnostic possibilities (Table 450-1). A gradual and progressive increase in symptoms with bilateral and symmetric involvement suggests a genetic, metabolic, immune, or toxic etiology. Conversely, focal, unilateral symptoms with headache and impaired level of consciousness accompanied by ipsilateral cranial nerve palsies and contralateral weakness imply a space-occupying cerebellar lesion.

(See also Chaps. 417–419) In pregnancy, the fetoplacental unit induces major metabolic changes, the purpose of which is to shunt glucose and amino acids to the fetus while the mother uses ketones and triglycerides to fuel her metabolic needs. These metabolic changes are accompanied by maternal insulin resistance caused in part by placental production of steroids, a growth hormone variant, and placental lactogen. Although pregnancy has been referred to as a state of “accelerated starvation,” it is better characterized as “accelerated ketosis.” In pregnancy, after an overnight fast, plasma glucose is lower by 0.8–1.1 mmol/L (15–20 mg/dL) than in the nonpregnant state. This difference is due to the use of glucose by the fetus. In early pregnancy, fasting may result in circulating glucose concentrations in the range of 2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) and may be associated with symptoms of hypoglycemia. In contrast to the decrease in maternal glucose concentration, plasma hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate levels rise to two to four times normal after a fast.

Pregnancy complicated by diabetes mellitus is associated with higher maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality rates. Preconception counseling and treatment are important for the diabetic patient contemplating pregnancy and can reduce the risk of congenital malformations and improve pregnancy outcome. Folate supplementation reduces the incidence of fetal neural tube defects, which occur with greater frequency in fetuses of diabetic mothers. In addition, optimizing glucose control during key periods of organogenesis reduces other congenital anomalies, including sacral agenesis, caudal dysplasia, renal agenesis, and ventricular septal defect.

At each return visit, the well-being of mother and fetus are assessed (see Table 9-1). Fetal heart rate, growth, and activity and amnionic fluid volume are evaluated. Maternal blood pressure and weight and their extent of change are examined. Symptoms such as headache, altered vision, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, bleeding, vaginal luid leakage, and dysuria are sought. Mter 20 weeks' gestation, uterine examination measures size from the symphysis to the fundus. In late pregnancy, vaginal examination often provides valuable information that includes conirmation of the presenting part and its station, clinical estimation of pelvic capacity and configuration, amnionic luid volume adequacy, and cervical consistency, efacement, and dilatation (Chap. 22, p. 435).

Between 20 and 34 weeks' gestation, the height of the uterine fundus measured in centimeters correlates closely with gestational age in weeks Gimenez, 1983). his measurement is used to monitor fetal growth and amnionic fluid volume. It is measured along the abdominal wall from the top of the symphysis pubis to the top of the fundus. Importantly, the bladder must be emptied before fundal measurement (Worthen, 1980). Obesity or the presence of uterine masses such as leiomyomas may also limit fundal height accuracy. Moreover, using fundal height alone, fetal-growth restriction may be undiagnosed in up to a third of cases (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2015b; Haragan, 2015).

Instruments incorporating Doppler ultrasound are often used to easily detect fetal heart action, and in the absence of maternal obesity, heart sounds are almost always detectable by 10 weeks with such instruments (Chap. 10, p. 213). he fetal heart rate ranges from 11e0 to 160 beats per minute and is typically heard as a double sound. Using a standard nonampliied stethoscope, the fetal heart is audible by 20 weeks in 80 percent of women, and by 22 weeks, heart sounds are expected to be heard in all (Herbert, 1987). Because the fetus moves freely in amni onic fluid, the site on the maternal abdomen where fetal heart sounds can be heard best will vary.

Diabetes in pregnancy is divided into two categories: gestational diabetes, in which onset occurs during pregnancy, and pregestational diabetes. The White classif cation (see Table 2.11-12) is commonly used to classify women according to the nature of their diabetes and the associated risk.

Carbohydrate intolerance of variable severity that is frst diagnosed during pregnancy. Occurs in 3–5% of all pregnancies, usually in late pregnancy.

Typically asymptomatic. Edema, polyhydramnios, or a large-for-GA infant (> 90th percentile) may be warning signs.

First step: One-hour 50-g glucose challenge test; venous plasma glucose is measured one hour later (at 24–28 weeks). Values ≥ 140 mg/dL are considered abnormal.

Next step: Confrm with an oral three-hour (100-g) glucose tolerance test showing any two of the following: fasting > 95 mg/dL; one hour > 180 mg/ dL; two hours > 155 mg/dL; three hours > 140 mg/dL.

Mother:

First step: Start with the ADA diet, regular exercise, and strict glucose monitoring (four times a day). Tight maternal glucose control (fasting glucose < 100; oneto two-hour postprandial glucose < 150) improves outcomes.

Next step: Add insulin if dietary control is insuff cient.

Give intrapartum insulin and dextrose to maintain tight control during delivery.

Fetus:

Obtain periodic ultrasound and NSTs to assess fetal growth and wellbeing.

It may be necessary to induce labor at 39–40 weeks.

More than 50% of patients go on to develop glucose intolerance and/or type 2 DM later in life.

Some centers have adopted more sensitive criteria, using values of <5.3 mmol/L (<95 mg/dL), <10 mmol/L (<180 mg/dL), <8.6 mmol/L (<155 mg/dL), and <7.8 mmol/L (<140 mg/dL) as the upper norms for a 3-h glucose tolerance test. Two elevated glucose values indicate a positive test. Adverse pregnancy outcomes for mother and fetus appear to increase with glucose as a continuous variable; thus it is challenging to define the optimal threshold for establishing the diagnosis of gestational diabetes.

Gestational diabetes occurs in approximately 4% of pregnancies. All pregnant women should be screened for gestational diabetes unless they are in a low-risk group. Women at low risk for gestational diabetes are those <25 years of age; those with a body mass index <25 kg/m2, no maternal history of macrosomia or gestational diabetes, and no diabetes in a first-degree relative; and those who are not members of a high-risk ethnic group (African American, Hispanic, Native American).

The remaining children have more mixed temperaments. The individual temperament of a child has important implications for parenting and for the advice a pediatrician may give in anticipatory guidance or behavioral problem counseling.

Although, to some degree, temperament may be hardwired (nature) in each child, the environment (nurture) inwhich the child grows has a strong effect on the child’s adjustment. Social and cultural factors can have marked effects on the child through differences in parenting style, educational approaches, and behavioral expectations.

Developmental and behavioral problems are more common than any category of problems in pediatrics, except acute infections and trauma. In 2008 15% of children ages 3 to 7 had a developmental disability, and others had behavioral disabilities. As many as 25% of children have serious psychosocial problems. Parents often neglect to mention these problems because they think the physician is uninterested or cannot help. It is necessary to monitor development and screen for the presence of these problems at health supervision visits, particularly in the years before preschool or early childhood learning center enrollment.

Development surveillance, done at every office visit, is an informal process comparing skill levels to lists of milestones. If suspicion of developmental or behavioral issues recurs, further evaluation is warranted (Table 8-1). Surveillance does not have a standard, and screening tests are necessary.

Developmental screening involves the use of standardized screening tests to identify children who require further diagnostic assessment. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the use of validated standardized screening tools at three of the health maintenance visits: 9 months, 18 months, and 30 months. Clinics and offices that serve a higher risk patient population (children living in poverty) often perform a screening test at every health maintenance visit. A child who fails to pass a developmental screening test requires more comprehensive evaluation but does not necessarily have a delay; definitive testing must confirm. Developmental evaluations for children with suspected delays and intervention services for children with diagnosed disabilities are available free to families. A combination of U.S. state and federal funds provides these services.

A second broad group of children with speech delay or slow speech development (no words by 18 months, no phrases by 30 months) comprises those in whom an overt pathologic basis is evident. In clinics where children of the latter type are studied systematically, 35 to 50 percent of cases occur in those with global developmental delay or “cerebral palsy.” Hearing deficit explains many of the other cases, as discussed later, and a few represent what appears to be a specific lack of maturation of the motor speech areas or an acquired lesion in these parts. Only in this small, latter group is it appropriate to refer to the language disorder as aphasia, that is, a derangement or loss of language caused by a cerebral lesion. Aphasia, when it occurs as the result of an acquired lesion (vascular, traumatic) is essentially of the motor variety and typically lasts but a few months in the child. It may be accompanied by a right-sided hemiplegia. An interesting type of acquired aphasia, possibly encephalitic, has been described by Landau and Kleffner in association with seizures and bitemporal focal discharges in the EEG (see “Seizures Presenting in Early Childhood” in Chap. 16).

Speech delay caused by congenital deafness, whether peripheral (loss of pure-tone acuity) or central (pure-tone threshold normal by audiogram), is a most important condition but may at first be difficult to discern. One suspects that faulty hearing is causal when there is a history of familial deaf mutism, congenital rubella, erythroblastosis fetalis, meningitis, chronic bilateral ear infections, or the administration of ototoxic drugs to the pregnant mother or newborn infant—the well-known antecedents of deafness. It is estimated that approximately 3 million American children have hearing defects; 0.1 percent of the school population are deaf and 1.5 percent are hard of hearing. The parents’ attention may be drawn to a defect in hearing when the infant fails to heed loud noises, to turn the eyes to sound sources outside the immediate visual fields, and to react to music; but in other instances, it is the delay in speaking that calls attention to it.

E. The child has a developmental age of at least 9 months.

Specify if:

Persistent: The disorder has been present for more than 12 months.

Specify current severity:

Disinhibited social engagement disorder is specified as severe when the child exhibits all symptoms of the disorder. with each symptom manifesting at relatively high levels.

The essential feature of disinhibited social engagement disorder is a pattern of behavior that involves culturally inappropriate, overly familiar behavior with relative strangers (Criterion A). This overly familiar behavior violates the social boundaries of the culture. A diagnosis of disinhibited social engagement disorder should not be made before children are developmentally able to form selective attachments. For this reason, the child must have a developmental age of at least 9 months.

Because of the shared etiological association with social neglect, disinhibited social en- gagement disorder may co-occur with developmental delays, especially cognitive and lan- guage delays, stereotypies, and other signs of severe neglect, such as malnutrition or poor care. However, signs of the disorder often persist even after these other signs of neglect are no longer present. Therefore, it is not uncommon for children with the disorder to present with no current signs of neglect. Moreover, the condition can present in children who show no signs of disordered attachment. Thus, disinhibited social engagement disorder may be seen in children with a history of neglect who lack attachments or whose attach- ments to their caregivers range from disturbed to secure.

The prevalence of disinhibited social attachment disorder is unknown. Nevertheless, the disorder appears to be rare, occurring in a minority of children, even those who have been severely neglected and subsequently placed in foster care or raised in institutions. In such high-risk populations, the condition occurs in only about 20% of children. The condition is seen rarely in other clinical settings.

Cleft lip is due to hypoplasia of the mesenchymal tissues withsubsequent failure of fusion. There is a strong genetic component; the risk is highest in children with affected first-degreerelatives. Monozygotic twins are affected with only 60%concordance, suggesting other nongenomic factors. Environmental factors during gestation also increase risk, including drugs (phenytoin, valproic acid, thalidomide), maternalalcohol and tobacco use, dioxins and other herbicides, and possibly high altitude. Chromosomal and nonchromosomal syndromes are associated with clefting, as are specific genesin some families.

Cleft lip can be unilateral or bilateral and associated with cleftpalate and defects of the alveolar ridge and dentition. When present, palatal defects allow direct communication between the nasal and oral cavities, creating problems with speech and feeding. Management includes squeeze-bottle feedings, special nipples, nipples with attached shields to seal the palate, and gastrostomy in severe cases. Surgical closure of the cleftlip is usually done by 3 months of age. Closure of the palate follows, usually before 1 year of age. Missing teeth are replaced by prostheses. Cosmetic results are often good, but depend on the severity of the defect.

Speech is nasal as a result of the cleft palate. Surgical treatment is effective, but sometimes does not restore palatal function completely. Speech therapy or, occasionally, the use of a speech-assisting appliance may help. Frequent episodes of otitis media are common, as are defects of teeth and the alveolar ridge.

Oropharyngeal Candida albicans infection, or thrush, is common in healthy neonates. The organism may be acquiredin the birth canal or from the environment. Persistent infection is common in breastfed infants as a result of colonization or infection of the mother’s nipples. Thrush in healthyolder patients can occur, but should suggest the possibilityof an immunodeficiency, broad-spectrum antibiotic use, ordiabetes.

TABLE 60–2 Effects of age on hepatic clearance of some drugs.

in the elderly; some of these drugs are listed in Table 60–2. The greatest changes are in phase I reactions, ie, those carried out by microsomal P450 systems. There are much smaller changes in the ability of the liver to carry out conjugation (phase II) reactions (see Chapter 4). Some of these changes may be caused by decreased liver blood flow (Table 60–1), an important variable in the clearance of drugs that have a high hepatic extraction ratio. In addition, there is a decline with age of the liver’s ability to recover from injury, eg, that caused by alcohol or viral hepatitis. Therefore, a history of recent liver disease in an older person should lead to caution in dosing with drugs that are cleared primarily by the liver, even after apparently complete recovery from the hepatic insult. Finally, malnutrition and diseases that affect hepatic function—eg, heart failure—are more common in the elderly. Heart failure may dramatically alter the ability of the liver to metabolize drugs by reducing hepatic blood flow. Similarly, severe nutritional deficiencies, which occur more often in old age, may impair hepatic function.

Hepatomegaly is not a highly reliable sign of liver disease because of variability in the liver’s size and shape and the physical impediments to assessment of liver size by percussion and palpation. Marked hepatomegaly is typical of cirrhosis, veno-occlusive disease, infiltrative disorders such as amyloidosis, metastatic or primary cancers of the liver, and alcoholic hepatitis. Careful assessment of the liver edge may also reveal unusual firmness, irregularity of the surface, or frank nodules. Perhaps the most reliable physical finding in the liver examination is hepatic tenderness. Discomfort when the liver is touched or pressed upon should be carefully sought with percussive comparison of the right and left upper quadrants.

Splenomegaly, which occurs in many medical conditions, can be a subtle but significant physical finding in liver disease. The availability of ultrasound methods for assessment of the spleen allows confirmation of the physical finding.

Signs of advanced liver disease include muscle wasting and weight loss as well as hepatomegaly, bruising, ascites, and edema. Ascites is best appreciated by attempts to detect shifting dullness by careful percussion. Ultrasound examination will confirm the finding of ascites in equivocal cases. Peripheral edema can occur with or without ascites. In patients with advanced liver disease, other factors frequently contribute to edema formation, including hypoalbuminemia, venous insufficiency, heart failure, and medications.

in mind during any evaluation for liver disease. Hepatitis A usually results in an acute self-limited ill-ness and only rarely leads to fulminant hepatic failure. Patients can present with fatigue, malaise, nausea, vomiting, anorexic fever, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The most com-mon physical findings are jaundice and hepatomegaly. Because the disease is self-limited, the treatment is usually supportive. Patients who develop fulminant infection require aggressive therapy and should be transferred to a center capable of per-forming liver transplantation.Hepatitis B and C, on the other hand, can both lead to chronic liver

Lentigo maligna Arises in a lentigo. Usually found on sun-damaged skin of the face. Superfcial spreading Typically affects younger adults, presenting on the trunk in men and on the legs in women. A relatively prolonged horizontal growth phase helps identify the disease early, when it is still conf ned to the epidermis. Nodular Lesions have a rapid vertical growth phase and appear as a rapidly growing reddish-brown nodule with ulceration or hemorrhage. Acral lentiginous Begins on the hands and feet as a slowly spreading, pigmented patch. Type most commonly seen in Asians and African-Americans. Amelanotic Presents as a lesion without clinical pigmentation. Extremely diffcult to identify.

(Reproduced, with permission, from Hurwitz RM. Pathology of the Skin: Atlas of Clinical-

Pathological Correlation, 2nd ed. Stamford, CT: Appleton & Lange, 1998: 432.) ■Malignant melanoma may metastasize, and 10% of patients with metastatic melanoma have no known 1° lesion. Metastasis may be local (to nearby skin), regional (between the original lesion and its regional lymph nodes), or distant (via lymphatic or hematogenous spread to almost every organ in the body).

Early recognition and treatment are essential. All adults should be examined for lesions that are suspicious for melanoma according to the ABCDE criteria, which identify dysplastic nevi and superficial spreading melanoma (see mnemonic).

The onset of pruritus is also an early sign of malignant change. An excisional biopsy should be performed on any suspicious lesion. Malignancy is determined histologically.

The well-developed facial lesions (adenomas of

Pringle), pathognomonic of tuberous sclerosis, are present in 90 percent of patients older than 4 years of age. Although called adenoma sebaceum, these nodules are actually angiofibromas; the sebaceous glands are only passively involved (Fig. 37-5). Typically they are red to pink nodules with a smooth, glistening surface, and they tend to be limited to the nasolabial folds, cheeks, and chin; sometimes they also involve the forehead and scalp. The earliest manifestation of facial angiofibromatosis may be a mild erythema over the cheeks and forehead that is intensified by crying. The occurrence of large plaques of connective tissue on the forehead is usually expressive of a severe form of the disease.

On the trunk, the diagnostic lesion is the “shagreen patch” (in reality a plaque of subepidermal fibrosis) found most often in the lumbosacral region. It appears as a flat, slightly elevated, flesh-colored area of skin 1 to 10 cm in diameter, with a “pigskin,” “elephant hide,” or “orange peel” appearance (Fig. 37-6). Another common site of fibromatous involvement is the nail bed; subungual fibromas usually appear at puberty and continue to develop with age. Other common skin changes, not in themselves diagnostic, include fibroepithelial tags (soft fibromas), café-au-lait spots, and port-wine hemangiomas.

Electrocardiographic The most widely used test for both the diagnosis of IHD and the estimation of risk and prognosis involves recording the 12-lead ECG before, during, and after exercise, usually on a treadmill (Fig. 293-2). The test consists of a standardized incremental increase in external workload (Table 293-2) while symptoms, the ECG, and arm blood pressure are monitored. Exercise duration is usually symptom-limited, and the test is discontinued upon evidence of chest discomfort, severe shortness of breath, dizziness, severe fatigue, ST-segment depression >0.2 mV (2 mm), a fall in systolic blood pressure >10 mmHg, or the development of a ventricular tachyarrhythmia. This test is used to discover any limitation in exercise performance, detect typical ECG signs of myocardial ischemia, and establish their relationship to chest discomfort. The ischemic ST-segment response generally is defined as flat or downsloping depression of the ST segment >0.1 mV below baseline (i.e., the PR segment) and lasting longer than 0.08 s (Fig. 293-1). Upsloping or junctional ST-segment changes are not considered characteristic of ischemia and do not constitute a positive test. Although T-wave abnormalities, conduction disturbances, and ventricular arrhythmias that develop during exercise should be noted, they are also not diagnostic. Negative exercise tests in which the target heart rate (85% of maximal predicted heart rate for age and sex) is not achieved are considered nondiagnostic.

In interpreting ECG stress tests, the probability that coronary artery disease (CAD) exists in the patient or population under study (i.e., pretest probability) should be considered. Overall, false-positive or false-negative results occur in one-third of cases. However, a positive result on exercise indicates that the likelihood of CAD is 98% in males who are >50 years with a history of typical angina pectoris and who develop chest discomfort during the test. The likelihood decreases if the patient has atypical or no chest pain by history and/or during the test.

Substernal chest pain 2° to myocardial ischemia (O2 supply and demand mismatch). Prinzmetal’s (variant) angina mimics angina pectoris but is caused by vasospasm of coronary vessels. It classically affects young women at rest in the early morning and is associated with ST-segment elevation in the absence of cardiac enzyme elevation.

The classic triad consists of substernal chest pain or pressure (often described as a heaviness or pressure without pain), usually precipitated by stress or exertion and relieved by rest or nitrates.

Pain can radiate to the left arm, jaw, and neck and may be associated with shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, diaphoresis, or lightheadedness.

Examination of patients experiencing stable angina is generally unremarkable. Look for carotid and peripheral bruits suggesting atherosclerosis and hypertension.

Rule out pulmonary, GI, or other cardiac causes of chest pain.

Angina may be diagnosed from the history alone, but significant ST-segment changes on exercise stress test with ECG monitoring is diagnostic of CAD.

Women and diabetics classically experience “silent” ischemic events and present “atypically”; for this reason, it is necessary to maintain a high index of suspicion in this patient population.

Treat acute symptoms with ASA, O2 and/or IV nitroglycerin, and IV morphine, and consider IV β-blockers. The efficacy of nondihydropyridine CCBs (diltiazem, verapamil) and ACEIs has also been validated.

Patients with a suspected MI must be admitted and monitored until acute MI is ruled out by serial cardiac enzymes.

Treat chronic symptoms with nitrates, ASA, and β-blockers; CCBs are second-line agents for symptomatic control only.

Initiate risk factor reduction (e.g., smoking, cholesterol, hypertension). Hormone replacement therapy is not protective in postmenopausal women.

Women, diabetics, the elderly, and post–heart transplant patients may have atypical, clinically silent MIs.

Other etiologies of embolic disease include postpartum status (amniotic f uid emboli), fracture (fat emboli), and cardiac surgery (air emboli).

Dyspnea, tachycardia, and a normal CXR in a hospitalized and/or bedridden patient should raise suspicion of pulmonary embolism.

Bleeding from right colonic vascular ectasias in the elderly may be overt or occult; it tends to be chronic and only occasionally is hemodynamically significant. Endoscopic hemostatic therapy may be useful in the treatment of vascular ectasias, as well as discrete bleeding ulcers and postpolypectomy bleeding. Surgical therapy is generally required for major, persistent, or recurrent bleeding from the wide variety of colonic sources of GIB that cannot be treated medically, angiographically, or endoscopically.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT:

Measurement of the heart rate and blood pressure is the best way to initially assess a patient with GIB. Clinically significant bleeding leads to postural changes in heart rate or blood pressure, tachycardia, and, finally, recumbent hypotension. In contrast, the hemoglobin does not fall immediately with acute GIB, due to proportionate reductions in plasma and red cell volumes (i.e., “people bleed whole blood”). Thus, hemoglobin may be normal or only minimally decreased at the initial presentation of a severe bleeding episode. As extravascular fluid enters the vascular space to restore volume, the hemoglobin falls, but this process may take up to 72 h. Transfusion is recommended when the hemoglobin drops below 7 g/dL, based on a large randomized trial showing this restrictive transfusion strategy decreases rebleeding and death in acute UGIB compared with a transfusion threshold of 9 g/dL. Patients with slow, chronic GIB may have very low hemoglobin values despite normal blood pressure and heart rate. With the development of iron-deficiency anemia, the mean corpuscular volume will be low and red blood cell distribution width will increase.

Physical Findings Splenomegaly is the most common physical finding, occurring in 20–70% of patients depending on health care screening frequency. Other less common findings include hepatomegaly (10–20%), lymphadenopathy (5–10%), and extramedullary disease (skin or subcutaneous lesions). The latter indicates CML transformation if a biopsy confirms the presence of sheets of blasts. Other physical findings are manifestations of complications of high tumor burden described earlier (e.g., cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, bleeding). High basophil counts may be associated with histamine overproduction causing pruritus, diarrhea, flushing, and even gastrointestinal ulcers.

Hematologic and Marrow Findings In untreated CML, leukocytosis ranging from 10–500 × 109/L is common. The peripheral blood differential shows left-shifted hematopoiesis with predominance of neutrophils and the presence of bands, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, promyelocytes, and blasts (usually ≤5%). Basophils and/or eosinophils are frequently increased. Thrombocytosis is common, but thrombocytopenia is rare and, when present, suggests a worse prognosis, disease acceleration, or an unrelated etiology. Anemia is present in one-third of patients. Cyclic oscillations of counts are noted in 25% of patients without treatment. Biochemical abnormalities include a low leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score and high levels of vitamin B12, uric acid, lactic dehydrogenase, and lysozyme. The presence of unexplained and sustained leukocytosis, with or without splenomegaly, should lead to a marrow examination and cytogenetic analysis.

document (2) 

The median presenting leukocyte count is about 15,000/μL. Between 25 and 40% of patients have counts <5000/μL, and 20% have counts >100,000/μL. Fewer than 5% have no detectable leukemic cells in the blood. The morphology of the malignant cell varies in different subsets. In AML, the cytoplasm often contains primary (nonspecific) granules, and the nucleus shows fine, lacy chromatin with one or more nucleoli characteristic of immature cells. Abnormal rod-shaped granules called Auer rods are not uniformly present, but when they are, myeloid lineage is virtually certain (Fig. 132-1). Poor neutrophil function may be noted functionally by impaired phagocytosis and migration and morphologically by abnormal lobulation and deficient granulation.

Platelet counts <100,000/μL are found at diagnosis in ~75% of patients, and about 25% have counts <25,000/μL. Both morphologic and functional platelet abnormalities can be observed, including large and bizarre shapes with abnormal granulation and inability of platelets to aggregate or adhere normally to one another.

Pretreatment Evaluation Once the diagnosis of AML is suspected, a rapid evaluation and initiation of appropriate therapy should follow. In addition to clarifying the subtype of leukemia, initial studies should evaluate the overall functional integrity of the major organ systems, including the cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, and renal systems (Table 132-4). Factors that have prognostic significance, either for achieving CR or for predicting the duration of CR, should also be assessed before initiating treatment, including cytogenetics and molecular markers (see above). Leukemic cells should be obtained from all patients and cryopreserved for future use as new tests and therapeutics become available. All patients should be evaluated for infection.

Most patients are anemic and thrombocytopenic at presentation. Replacement of the appropriate blood components, if necessary, should begin promptly. Because qualitative platelet dysfunction or the presence of an infection may increase the likelihood of bleeding, evidence of hemorrhage justifies the immediate use of platelet transfusion, even if the platelet count is only moderately decreased.

The natural history of severe aplastic anemia is rapid deterioration and death. Historically, provision first of RBC and later of platelet transfusions and effective antibiotics were of some benefit, but few patients show spontaneous recovery. The major prognostic determinant is the blood count. Severe disease has been defined by the presence of two of three parameters: absolute neutrophil count <500/μL, platelet count <20,000/μL, and corrected reticulocyte count <1% (or absolute reticulocyte count <60,000/μL). In the era of effective immunosuppressive therapies, absolute numbers of reticulocytes (>25,000/μL) and lymphocytes (>1000/μL) may be better predictors of response to treatment and long-term outcome.

Severe acquired aplastic anemia can be cured by replacement of the absent hematopoietic cells (and the immune system) by stem cell transplant, or it can be ameliorated by suppression of the immune system to allow recovery of the patient’s residual bone marrow function. Glucocorticoids are not of value as primary therapy. Suspect exposures to drugs or chemicals should be discontinued; however, spontaneous recovery of severe blood count depression is rare, and a waiting period before beginning treatment may not be advisable unless the blood counts are only modestly depressed.

This is the best therapy for the younger patient with a fully histocompatible sibling donor (Chap. 139e). Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing should be ordered as soon as the diagnosis of aplastic anemia is established in a child or younger adult. In transplant candidates, transfusion of blood from family members should be avoided so as to prevent sensitization to histocompatibility antigens, but limited numbers of blood products probably do not greatly affect outcome. For allogeneic transplant from fully matched siblings, long-term survival rates for children are approximately 90%. Transplant morbidity and mortality are increased among adults, due to the higher risk of chronic GVHD and serious infections.

For knee OA, several operations are available. Arthroscopic debridement and lavage have diminished in popularity after randomized trials evaluating this operation have showed that its efficacy is no greater than that of sham surgery or no treatment for relief of pain or disability. Even mechanical symptoms such as buckling, which are extremely common in patients with knee OA, do not respond to arthroscopic debridement. Although arthroscopic meniscectomy is indicated for acute meniscal tears in which symptoms such as locking and acute pain are clearly related temporally to a knee injury that produced the tear, recent trials show that doing a partial meniscectomy in persons with OA and a symptomatic meniscal tear does not relieve knee pain or improve function.

For patients with knee OA isolated to the medial compartment, operations to realign the knee to lessen medial loading can relieve pain. These include a high tibial osteotomy, in which the tibia is broken just below the tibial plateau and realigned so as to load the lateral, nondiseased compartment, or a unicompartmental replacement with realignment. Each surgery may provide the patient with years of pain relief before a total knee replacement is required.

Ultimately, when the patient with knee or hip OA has failed medical treatment modalities and remains in pain, with limitations of physical function that compromise the quality of life, the patient should be referred for total knee or hip arthroplasty. These are highly efficacious operations that relieve pain and improve function in the vast majority of patients, although rates of success are higher for hip than knee replacement. Currently failure rates for both are ~1% per year, although these rates are higher in obese patients. The chance of surgical success is greater in centers where at least 25 such operations are performed yearly or with surgeons who perform multiple operations annually. The timing of knee or hip replacement is critical. If the patient suffers for many years until their functional status has declined substantially, with considerable muscle weakness, postoperative functional status may not improve to a level achieved by others who underwent operation earlier in their disease course.

Interstitial cystitis (IC)/bladder pain syndrome occurs more often in women than men. Most patients are between 40 and 60 years of age. In 2002, painful bladder disorders were defined by the International Continence Society (ICS) in a set of new recommendations (109). The most widely used definition, painful bladder syndrome (PBS) is described as a clinical syndrome (i.e., a complex of symptoms) consisting of “suprapubic pain related to bladder filling, accompanied by other symptoms, such as increased daytime and nighttime frequency in the absence of proven infection or other obvious pathology.” By comparison, the term “interstitial cystitis” refers to patients who have PBS symptoms, but who also have “typical cystoscopic and histological features” during bladder hydrodistension (109).

The etiology of IC/PBS is unknown, but several hypotheses exist. A defective glycosaminoglycan (GAG) epithelial layer, which allows irritating substances in the urine to penetrate the urothelium to the subepithelial nerve endings, may be responsible for the syndrome (110). This theoretical mechanism is based on the fact that many IC sufferers have a positive potassium diffusion test and are sensitive to certain foods and beverages. Immunological mechanisms were proposed because abnormal mast cell activity, increased substance P expressing nerve fibers and increased nerve growth factor, were all found in bladder biopsies of IC affected individuals (110). Autoimmune mechanisms may be responsible in some individuals given that there is a higher incidence of systemic lupus erythematosus, allergies, inﬂammatory bowel and irritable bowel disease, and fibromyalgia in patients with bladder symptoms. Another possible mechanism is central sensitization with altered sympathetic and hypothalamic adrenal axis, substantiated by the existence of “phantom” bladder pain even after surgical removal of the bladder (110).

Symptoms include severe and disabling urinary frequency and urgency, nocturia, and occasional dysuria and hematuria. Suprapubic, pelvic, urethral, vaginal, vulvar, or perineal pain is common and can be relieved to some extent by emptying of the bladder (111).

In knees, buckling may occur, in part, due to weakness of muscles crossing the joint. Mechanical symptoms, such as buckling, catching, or locking, could also signify internal derangement, such as meniscal tears, and need to be evaluated. In the knee, pain with activities requiring knee flexion, such as stair climbing and arising from a chair, often emanates from the patellofemoral compartment of the knee, which does not actively articulate until the knee is bent ~35°.

OA is the most common cause of chronic knee pain in persons over age 45, but the differential diagnosis is long. Inflammatory arthritis is likely if there is prolonged morning stiffness and many other joints are affected. Bursitis occurs commonly around knees and hips. A physical examination should focus on whether tenderness is over the joint line (at the junction of the two bones around which the joint is articulating) or is outside of it. Anserine bursitis, medial and distal to the knee, is an extremely common cause of chronic knee pain that may respond to a glucocorticoid injection. Prominent nocturnal pain in the absence of end-stage OA merits a distinct workup. For hip pain, OA can be detected by loss of internal rotation on passive movement, and pain isolated to an area lateral to the hip joint usually reflects the presence of trochanteric bursitis.

No blood tests are routinely indicated for workup of patients with OA unless symptoms and signs suggest inflammatory arthritis.

Examination of the synovial fluid is often more helpful diagnostically than an x-ray. If the synovial fluid white count is >1000/μL, inflammatory arthritis or gout or pseudogout is likely, the latter two being also identified by the presence of crystals.

Hydration and analgesia are the initial treatment.

Kidney stones < 5 mm in diameter can pass through the urethra; stones < 3 cm in diameter can be treated with extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL), percutaneous nephrolithotomy, or retrograde ureteroscopy.

Preventive measures include hydration; additional prophylaxis is dependent on stone composition.

Characterized by the presence of progressive cystic dilation of the renal tubules, as well as by cysts in the spleen, liver, and pancreas. The two major forms are as follows: ■Autosomal dominant (ADPKD):

Most common.

Usually asymptomatic until patients are > 30 years of age.

One-half of ADPKD patients will have ESRD requiring dialysis by age 60.

Associated with an ↑ risk of cerebral aneurysm, especially in patients with a  family history.

Autosomal recessive (ARPKD): Less common but more severe. Presents in infants and young children with renal failure, liver fibrosis, and portal hypertension; may lead to death in the first few years of life.

Pain and hematuria are the most common presenting symptoms. Sharp, localized pain may result from cyst rupture, infection, or passage of renal calculi.

Additional findings include hypertension, hepatic cysts, cerebral berry aneurysms, diverticulosis, and mitral valve prolapse.

Patients may have large, palpable kidneys on abdominal exam.

Based on ultrasound (most common) or CT scan. Multiple bilateral cysts will be present throughout the renal parenchyma, and renal enlargement will be visualized. Genetic testing by DNA linkage analysis for ADPKD1 and ADPKD2 is available.

Prevent complications and ↓ the rate of progression to ESRD. Early management of UTIs is critical to prevent renal cyst infection. BP control (ACEIs, ARBs) is necessary to ↓ hypertension-induced renal damage.

Dialysis and renal transplantation are used to manage patients with ESRD.

Chronic bronchitis is diagnosed on clinical grounds: it is defined by the presence of a persistent productive cough for at least 3 consecutive months in at least 2 consecutive years. It is common among cigarette smokers and urban dwellers in smog-ridden cities; some studies indicate that 20% to 25% of men in the 40to 65-year-old age group have the disease. In early stages of the disease, the cough raises mucoid sputum, but airflow is not obstructed. Some patients with chronic bronchitis have evidence of hyperresponsive airways, with intermittent bronchospasm and wheezing (asthmatic bronchitis), while other bronchitic patients, especially heavy smokers, develop chronic outflow obstruction, usually with associated emphysema (COPD).

The distinctive feature of chronic bronchitis is hypersecretion of mucus, beginning in the large airways.

document (1) 

Chronic Obstructive COPD is the greatest risk factor for the development of postoperative pulmonary com-Pulmonary Disease plications. COPD encompasses both chronic bronchitis and emphysema, disease entities that often occur in tandem. Cigarette smoke is implicated in the pathogenesis of both, and any treatment plan must include cessation of smoking (242). Chronic bronchitis is defined as the presence of productive cough on most days for at least 3 months per year and for at least 2 successive years (243). It is characterized by chronic airway inﬂammation and excessive mucus production. The histologic changes of emphysema include destruction of alveolar septa and distension of airspaces distal to terminal alveoli. The destruction of alveoli results in air trapping, loss of pulmonary elastic recoil, collapse of the airways in expiration, increased work of breathing, and significant ventilation-perfusion mismatching (243). The impaired ability to cough effectively and clear secretions predisposes patients with COPD to atelectasis and pneumonia in the postoperative period.

Patients with COPD and a history of heavy smoking account for most postoperative pulmonary complications in gynecologic surgical patients. The severity of COPD can be determined preoperatively via a thorough history and physical examination. According to recommendations regarding the use of preoperative pulmonary function tests by the American College of Physicians, these should be reserved for individuals in whom COPD is suspected, but unconfirmed (237,241). Typically, patients with COPD demonstrate impaired expiratory air ﬂow, manifested by diminished FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC).

Data suggest that arterial blood gas measurements may show varying degrees of hypoxemia and hypercapnia: routine use of preoperative arterial blood gas measurement does not stratify patients into a higher risk subset for postoperative complications (236).

Pneumonia Pneumonia is defined as inﬂammation of the distal lung that includes terminal airways, alveolar spaces, and the interstitium. Pneumonia may have multiple causes, including viral and bacterial infections or aspiration. Aspiration pneumonia is usually the result of depressed awareness commonly associated with the use of drugs and alcohol or anesthesia. Viral pneumonias are caused by multiple infectious agents, including inﬂuenza A or B, parainﬂuenza virus, or respiratory syncytial virus. Most viral syndromes are spread by aerosolization associated with coughing, sneezing, and even conversation. Incubation is short, requiring only 1 to 3 days before the acute onset of fever, chills, headache, fatigue, and myalgias. Symptom intensity is directly related to intensity of the host febrile reaction. Pneumonia develops in only 1% of patients who have a viral syndrome, but mortality rates may reach 30% in immunocompromised individuals and the elderly. An additional risk is the development of secondary bacterial pneumonias after the initial viral insult. These infections are more common in elderly patients and may explain the high fatality in this group (8). Staphylococcal pneumonias, which often arise from a previous viral infection, are extremely lethal regardless of patient age. The best treatment for viral pneumonia is prevention by immunization. Treatment is supportive and consists mostly of administration of antipyretics and ﬂuids.

Bacterial pneumonia is classified as either community acquired or nosocomial, and in many cases the classification determines prognosis and antibiotic therapy. Risk factors that contribute to mortality are chronic cardiopulmonary diseases, alcoholism, diabetes, renal failure, malignancy, and malnutrition. Prognostic features associated with poor outcome include greater than two lobe involvement, respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths per minute on presentation, severe hypoxemia (<60 mm Hg on room air), hypoalbuminemia, and septicemia. Pneumonia is a common cause of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a mortality rate between 50% and 70% (9,10).

document (3) 

Pulmonary involvement is frequently prominent; 35% of patients have a hacking, nonproductive cough, and 23% of patients who undergo chest radiography have pulmonary densities due to interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and pleural effusions. Bibasilar rales are the most common pulmonary sign. Less common clinical manifestations include abdominal pain, confusion, stupor, seizures, ataxia, coma, and jaundice. Clinical laboratory studies frequently reveal anemia and leukopenia early in the course, leukocytosis late in the course, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, hypoalbuminemia, mildly increased serum hepatic aminotransferases, and prerenal azotemia. Complications can include respiratory failure, hematemesis, cerebral hemorrhage, and hemolysis. Severe illness necessitates the admission of 10% of hospitalized patients to an intensive care unit. Greater severity is generally associated with old age, underlying disease, and treatment with a sulfonamide; the case-fatality rate is 1%. In a study of children with murine typhus, 50% suffered only nocturnal fevers, feeling well enough for active daytime play.

Diagnosis and Treatment Serologic studies of acuteand convalescent-phase sera can provide a diagnosis, and an immunohistochemical method for identification of typhus group-specific antigens in biopsy samples has been developed. Cultivation and PCR are used only infrequently and are not widely available. Nevertheless, most patients are treated empirically with doxycycline (100 mg bid orally for 7–15 days) on the basis of clinical suspicion. Ciprofloxacin provides an alternative if doxycycline is contraindicated.

Acute infections are most often subclinical and anicteric.

When they are clinically apparent, nausea and vomiting, headache, and malaise may precede jaundice by 1 to 2 weeks. Lowgrade fever is more common with hepatitis A. By the time jaundice develops, symptoms are usually improving. Serum transaminase levels vary, and their peaks do not correspond with disease severity (see Table 55-1). Peak levels that range from 400 to 4000 U/L are usually reached by the time jaundice develops. Serum bilirubin values typically continue to rise, despite falling serum transaminase levels, and peak at 5 to 20 mgl dL.

Any evidence for severe disease should prompt hospitalization. These include persistent nausea and vomiting, prolonged prothrombin time, low serum albumin level, hypoglycemia, high serum bilirubin level, or central nervous system symptoms. In most cases, however, clinical and biochemical recovery is complete within 1 to 2 months in all cases of hepatitis A, in most cases of hepatitis B, but in only a small proportion of cases of hepatitis C.

When patients are hospitalized, their feces, secretions, bedpans, and other articles in contact with the intestinal tract should be handled with glove-protected hands. Extra precautions, such as double gloving during delivery and surgical procedures, are recommended. Due to significant exposure of health-care personnel to hepatitis B, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2016a) recommend active and passive vaccination, described later. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C, so recommendations are for postexposure serosurveillance only.

Acute hepatitis has a case-fatality rate of 0.1 percent. For patients ill enough to be hospitalized, it may reach 1 percent. Most fatalities are due to fulminant hepatic necrosis, which in later pregnancy may resemble acute fatty liver. In these cases, hepatic encephalopathy is the usual presentation, and the mortality rate is 80 percent. Approximately half of patients with fulminant disease have hepatitis B infection, and co-infection with the delta agent is common.

Some patients with heat exhaustion develop heatstroke after removal from the heat-stress environment. Aggressive cooling of non-responders is indicated until their core temperature is 39°C (102.2°F). Except in mild cases, free water deficits should be replaced slowly over 24–48 h to avoid a decrease of serum osmolality by >2 mOsm/h.

The disposition of younger, previously healthy heat-exhaustion patients who have no major laboratory abnormalities may include hospital observation and discharge after IV rehydration. Older patients with comorbidities (including cardiovascular disease) or predisposing factors often require inpatient fluid and electrolyte replacement, monitoring, and reassessment.

The clinical manifestations of heatstroke reflect a total loss of thermo-regulatory function. Typical vital-sign abnormalities include tachypnea, various tachycardias, hypotension, and a widened pulse pressure. Although there is no single specific diagnostic test, the historical and physical triad of exposure to a heat stress, CNS dysfunction, and a core temperature >40.5°C helps establish the preliminary diagnosis.

The definitive diagnosis should be reserved until the other potential causes of hyperthermia are excluded. Many of the usual laboratory abnormalities seen with heatstroke overlap with other conditions. If the patient's mental status does not improve with cooling, toxicologic screening may be indicated, and cranial CT and spinal fluid analysis can be considered.

The premonitory clinical characteristics may be nonspecific and include weakness, dizziness, disorientation, ataxia, and gastrointestinal or psychiatric symptoms. These prodromal symptoms often resemble heat exhaustion. The sudden onset of heatstroke occurs when the maintenance of adequate perfusion requires peripheral vasoconstriction to stabilize the mean arterial blood pressure. As a result, the cutaneous radiation of heat ceases. At this juncture, the core temperature rises dramatically. Since many patients with heatstroke also meet the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome and have a broad differential diagnosis, rapid cooling is essential during the extensive diagnostic evaluation (Table 479e-1).

Examination discloses varying degrees of motor, sensory, and reflex loss. As the symptoms suggest, the signs are symmetrical, and more severe in distal than in proximal portions of the limbs, and often confined to the legs. In some cases, the disproportionate affection of motor power may be striking, taking the form of a footand wrist-drop, but the proximal muscles are usually affected as well (indicated, for example, by climbing stairs or by difficulty in arising from a squatting position). In a few patients, the weakness appears to be most severe in the proximal muscles. Absolute paralysis of the legs had been observed in the past only rarely; immobility caused by contractures at the knees and ankles in neglected patients was a more common occurrence. Tenderness of muscles on deep pressure is a highly characteristic finding, elicited most readily in the muscles of the feet and calves. In the arms, tendon reflexes are sometimes retained despite a loss of strength in the hands. In patients in whom pain and dysesthesias are prominent and motor loss is slight, the reflexes at knee and ankle may be retained or even of greater than average briskness. This attests to the predominant affection of the small nerve fibers.

Excessive sweating of the soles and dorsal aspects of the feet and of the volar surfaces of the hands and fingers is a common manifestation of alcohol-induced nutritional neuropathy. Postural hypotension is also sometimes associated, indicative of involvement of the peripheral sympathetic nerve fibers.

Sensory loss or impairment may involve all the modalities, although one may be affected out of proportion to the others, usually pain and temperature. One cannot predict from the patient’s symptoms which mode of sensation might be affected disproportionately. In patients with impairment of superficial sensation (i.e., touch, pain, and temperature), the border between impaired and normal sensation is not sharp but shades off gradually over a considerable vertical extent of the limbs.

If open pneumothorax is identified, an occlusive dressing must be applied immediately. This must be secured on three sides only to prevent the development of tension pneumothorax.

Massive hemothorax is diagnosed through chest tube placement and is defined as > 1000 cc of immediate blood return or > 200/hour for > 2–4 hours. The treatment for massive hemothorax is volume resuscitation followed by surgery to repair the site of bleeding. The treatment for ﬂail chest is supportive, followed by surgical fixation of the chest wall.

Circulation:

Apply direct pressure to any actively bleeding wounds.

Place a 16-gauge IV in each antecubital fossa.

Isotonic ﬂuids (LR or NS) are repleted in a 3:1 ratio (ﬂuid to blood loss). Start with a ﬂuid bolus of 1–2 L in adults; then recheck vitals and continue repletion as indicated.

If the patient remains tachycardic or hypotensive after the first 2 L of isotonic ﬂuid, transfusion with packed RBCs may be indicated.

To remember the Glasgow Coma Scale, think 4-eyes, Jackson-5, V6 engine. Four points can be assigned for eye response, five points for verbal response, and six points for motor response.

Patients with chest trauma and shock may have cardiac tamponade. The relevant signs are JVD, hypotension, and mufﬂed heart sounds. This can be diagnosed with bedside ultrasound. If tamponade is diagnosed, an immediate pericardiocentesis is necessary.

Disability/Exposure:

Disability (CNS dysfunction) is assessed and quantified with the GCS.

Exposure requires that the patient be completely disrobed and assessed for injury and temperature status on both the front and back of the body. Hypothermia is a common problem in trauma and can worsen bleeding; once the exam is done, the patient should be covered with warm blankets.

Once the patient is stable, conduct a full examination.

Anxiety disorder is a chronic state, some would say a disease, punctuated by recurrent attacks of acute anxiety or panic. The acute attacks are the hallmark of the disease and some psychiatrists are reluctant to make a diagnosis of anxiety neurosis in their absence. Because of the clinical features of panic attacks and particularly their episodic nature, simulating an acute medical condition, they are of special interest to neurologists and general physicians. While anxiety may be inferred from observing the activities of young children, and is reported as a form of nervousness by older children and adolescents, more often there are physical complaints at times of transition or stress during the day or year.

Panic attacks in their full form are prone to begin after this age and are almost as dramatic as seizures. They often begin with distressing feelings of dread and foreboding. The patient is assailed by a sense of strangeness, as though his body had changed or the surroundings were unreal. He is frightened, sometimes by the prospect of imminent death (angor animi) or of losing his mind or self-control. There may be a feeling of smothering. “I am dying” or “I can’t breathe” are characteristic expressions of alarm and panic. The heart races, breathing comes in rapid gasps, the pupils may be dilated, and the patient may sweat or tremble. The palpitation and breathing difficulties are so prominent that a cardiologist is often consulted. Some of our psychiatric colleagues identify breathlessness or a suffocating feeling as central to the diagnosis of panic (and attribute psychologic meaning to the symptom), but this is not sustained in our observations of affected patients. The symptoms abate spontaneously after 15 to 30 min, leaving the patient shaken, tense, perplexed, and often embarrassed. There is no confusion, and after the episode there is full memory of the event.

DEPRESSIVE REACTIONS (SEE ALSO CHAP. 48)

There are few persons who do not at some time experience periods of severe discouragement and despair. As with nervousness, irritability, and anxiety, depression of mood that is appropriate to a given situation in life (e.g., grief reaction) is seldom the basis of medical concern. People in these situations tend to seek help only when their grief or unhappiness is persistent and beyond control. However, there are numerous instances in which the symptoms of depression assert themselves for reasons that are not apparent. Often the symptoms are interpreted as a medical illness, bringing the patient first to the internist or neurologist. Sometimes another disease is found (such as cancer, chronic hepatitis, or other infection or postinfectious asthenia) in which chronic fatigue is confused with depression; more often the opposite pertains, that is, an endogenous depression is the essential problem even when there has been evidence earlier of a viral or bacterial infection.

From the patient and the family it is learned that the patient has been “feeling unwell,” “low in spirits,” “blue,” “down,” “unhappy,” or “morbid.” There has been a change in his emotional reactions of which the patient may not be fully aware. Activities that were formerly found pleasurable are no longer so. Often, however, change in mood is less conspicuous than reduction in psychic and physical energy, and it is in this type of patient that diagnosis is most difficult. A complaint of fatigue is almost invariable; not uncommonly, it is worse in the morning after a night of restless sleep. The patient complains of a “loss of energy,” “weakness,” “tiredness,” “having no energy,” that his job has become more difficult. His outlook is pessimistic. The patient is irritable and preoccupied with uncontrollable worry over trivialities. With excessive worry, the ability to think with accustomed efficiency is reduced; the patient complains that his mind is not functioning properly, and he is forgetful and unable to concentrate. If the patient is naturally of suspicious nature, paranoid tendencies may assert themselves.

NERVOUSNESS, ANXIETY, STRESS,

The world is full of nervous, tense, apprehensive, and worried people. The stresses of contemporary society are often blamed for their plight. The poet W.H. Auden referred to his era as “the age of anxiety,” and little has changed since then. Medical historians have identified comparable periods of pervasive anxiety dating back to the time of Marcus Aurelius and Constantine, when societies were undergoing rapid and profound changes, and individuals were assailed by an overwhelming sense of insecurity, personal insignificance, and fear of the future (Rosen).

Like fatigue, nervousness, irritability, and anxiety are among the most frequent symptoms encountered in office and hospital practice. A British survey found that more than 40 percent of the population, at one time or another, experienced symptoms of severe anxiety, and approximately 5 percent suffered from lifelong anxiety states (Lader). The latter is difficult to distinguish from what is currently termed generalized anxiety disorder, a state of constant worry discussed further on. The vast amount of antianxiety medication and alcohol that is consumed in our society would tend to corroborate these figures.

Of course, any person facing a challenging or threatening task for which he may feel unprepared and inadequate experiences some degree of nervousness and anxiety. Anxiety is then not abnormal, and the alertness and attentiveness that accompany it may actually improve performance up to a point. Barratt and White found that mildly anxious medical students performed better on examinations than those lacking in anxiety. As anxiety increases, so does the standard of performance, but only to a point, after which increasing anxiety causes a rapid decline in performance (Yerkes-Dodson law).

If worry or depression stands in clear relation to serious economic reverses or loss of a loved one, the symptom is also usually accepted as normal, but no less worthy of emotional support. Only when it is excessively intense or prolonged or when accompanying visceral derangements are prominent do anxiety and depression become matters of medical concern. Admittedly, the line that separates normal emotional reactions and pathologic ones is not sharp. Chapter 48 deals with these matters more fully.

A sense of unreality

Fear of going crazy or dying

Chills or hot ﬂashes The attacks can recur with or without specific precipitating events (148). The patient is preoccupied with them and makes behavioral changes she hopes will avert future attacks: avoiding specific situations, assuring herself there is an escape route from certain situations, or refusing to be alone.

The symptoms of panic attacks are often confused with the symptoms of cardiac or pulmonary disease. They lead to many fruitless trips to the emergency department and to costly, even invasive, medical investigations. A careful history can establish the correct diagnosis in most cases (153–155).

Agoraphobia Agoraphobia is the avoidance of situations in which the patient fears she may be trapped, such as the center of a row in the theater or driving over a bridge. She fears that such a situation will trigger anxiety or a panic attack and therefore tends more and more to stay at home or limit her sphere of activity to an increasingly short list of venues. Agoraphobia and panic disorder can occur separately or together (150–154).

Specific Phobias Specific phobias are irrational fears of certain objects or situations, although the patient recognizes that the object or situation poses no real danger. Of particular concern in gynecology are fear of needles and fear of vomiting (150).

Social phobia causes the patient to fear and avoid situations in which the patient anticipates, without rational cause, that she will be perceived in a humiliating light. Such situations include giving a business-related presentation, making an announcement at a meeting, and having a casual dinner with friends. Patients may alter their lives to avoid these anxieties, interfering with their interpersonal relationships and their ability to carry out their responsibilities, or they may manage to carry on despite considerable psychological pain (150).

Direct immunofluorescence microscopy of lesional skin is usually negative, although granular deposits of immunoglobulin(s) and complement in the epidermal basement membrane zone have been described in some patients. Treatment should be directed at the systemic disease. Topical glucocorticoids are sometimes useful; patients should avoid exposure to ultraviolet irradiation and aggressively use photoprotective measures, including broad-spectrum sunscreens.

Biopsies are also processed for direct immunofluorescence using conjugated antibodies against IgG, IgM, and IgA to detect the presence of “lumpy-bumpy” immune deposits or “linear” IgG or IgA antibodies bound to GBM, antibodies against trapped complement proteins (C3 and C4), or specific antibodies against a relevant antigen. High-resolution electron microscopy can clarify the principal location of immune deposits and the status of the basement membrane.

Along with the clinical picture, a  Nikolsky’s sign (the ability to produce a blister by rubbing skin adjacent to a natural blister) and skin biopsy with immunoﬂ uorescence confirm the diagnosis.

Biopsy shows acantholysis (intraepidermal split with free-ﬂ oating keratinocytes in the blister). Immunoﬂ uorescence and ELISA are confirmatory for antidesmoglein antibodies.

Long-term treatment is generally required. Initially, systemic corticosteroids are used at high doses in combination with steroid-sparing agents introduced early to ↓ corticosteroid side effects.

IgA deposits in the skin are unaffected by control of disease with medication; however, these immunoreactants diminish in intensity or disappear in patients maintained for long periods on a strict gluten-free diet (see below). Patients with DH have granular deposits of IgA in their epidermal basement membrane zone and should be distinguished from individuals with linear IgA deposits at this site (see below).

A renal biopsy in the setting of glomerulonephritis quickly identifies the type of glomerular injury and often suggests a course of treatment. The biopsy is processed for light microscopy using stains for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to assess cellularity and architecture, periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) to stain carbohydrate moieties in the membranes of the glomerular tuft and tubules, Jones-methenamine silver to enhance basement membrane structure, Congo red for amyloid deposits, and Masson’s trichrome to identify collagen deposition and assess the degree of glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. Biopsies are also processed

Biopsy of early lesional skin reveals neutrophil-rich infiltrates within dermal papillae. Neutrophils, fibrin, edema, and microvesicle formation at these sites are characteristic of early disease. Older lesions may demonstrate nonspecific features of a subepidermal bulla or an excoriated papule. Because the clinical and histologic features of this disease can be variable and resemble those of other subepidermal blistering disorders, the diagnosis is confirmed by direct immunofluorescence microscopy of normal-appearing perilesional skin. Such studies demonstrate granular deposits of IgA (with or without complement components) in the papillary dermis and along the

The course of anxiety traits is variable. A 20-year followup study by Wheeler and associates showed that symptoms were still present in 88 percent but persisted in being moderately or severely disabling in only 15 percent. Most affected patients were able to work and to enjoy a reasonably normal family and social life. Their only liability to further psychiatric illness was to later anxious depression, whereas so-called psychosomatic illnesses and other psychiatric illnesses did not occur more frequently than in the general population. Those with uncomplicated anxiety neurosis rarely commit suicide.

Anxiety disorder has been attributed to a genetic abnormality, to a “constitutional weakness” of the nervous system, to social and psychologic factors, and to physiologic and biochemical derangements; but none of these factors provides a completely satisfactory explanation of the primary problem.

The onset of both acute and chronic anxiety, as mentioned, is rare before age 18 years or after 35 to 40 years of age (average age of onset 25 years). The condition in some series is twice as frequent in women as in men and there is clearly a high familial incidence. In one study (Wheeler et al) there was a prevalence of 49 percent among the grown children of patients with anxiety neurosis, compared with 5 percent in the general population. Slater and Shields found that there was a concordance rate of 40 percent in identical twins, compared with 4 percent in dizygotic twins. Among the relatives of index cases, the mothers suffered from anxiety neurosis more often than did the fathers; in the latter, alcoholism was more frequent than in the population at large (Modlin). A clear pattern of inheritance has not been established, but it approximates that of autosomal dominance with incomplete penetrance. The psychodynamic theories that attempt to provide a unified explanation of these diverse anxiety states were reviewed by Nemiah and we do not dismiss them but cannot comment authoritatively.

The symptoms of an anxiety resemble those of fear in many ways, although nearly always the former are longer in duration and less distinct. The most important difference, however, is that the cause of fear is known to the patient, whereas that of anxiety is not. The most extreme but not inconceivable interpretation of anxiety is the James-Lange theory of emotion, mentioned earlier, which attributes the psychologic experience entirely to the accompanying physical symptoms.

As a rule, anorexia nervosa begins shortly after puberty—sometimes later, but seldom after 30 years of age. Some of the patients were overweight in childhood, especially in the prepubertal period. Dieting is much talked about and may have been encouraged, especially by mothers who want their daughters to be more attractive. In epochs such as the current one, where dieting and female thinness are considered normative and desirable, the illness seems to be more common and lesser but transient forms of the disorder are rampant in high school-and college-age young women. Sometimes there appears to be a precipitating event, such as leaving home, disruption of family life, or other stress. Whatever the provocation, it leads to an obsessive refusal to eat. What is more important, the abnormal eating habits persist even when the patient has become painfully thin, and when counseled to eat normally she will use every artifice to starve herself. Food is hidden instead of being eaten, vomiting may be provoked after a meal, or the bowel may be emptied by laxatives. The patient shows no concern about her obvious emaciation and remains active. If left alone, these patients waste away, and approximately 5 percent have succumbed to some intercurrent infection or other medical complication, placing it among the most lethal of psychiatric conditions.

One is struck with the degree of emaciation; it exceeds that of most of the known wasting diseases. Often 30 percent or more of the body weight will have been lost by the time the patient’s family insists on medical consultation. Bradycardia and hypotension are indicators for hospitalization. A fine lanugo covers the face, body, and limbs. The skin is thin and dry, without its normal elasticity, and the nails are brittle. The dental enamel is eroded. Pubic hair and breast tissue (except for loss of fat) are normal, and, in this respect, anorexia nervosa is unlike hypopituitary cachexia (Simmonds disease). Surprisingly, however, there are no neurologic signs of nutritional deficiency. The patient is alert and cheerfully indifferent to her condition. Any suggestion that she is unattractively thin or seriously depleted is rejected.

Early in the course of disease, symptoms and signs are often nonspecific and insidious, consisting mainly of diurnal fever and night sweats due to defervescence, weight loss, anorexia, general malaise, and weakness. However, in up to 90% of cases, cough eventually develops—often initially nonproductive and limited to the morning and subsequently accompanied by the production of purulent sputum, sometimes with blood streaking. Hemoptysis develops in 20–30% of cases, and massive hemoptysis may ensue as a consequence of the erosion of a blood vessel in the wall of a cavity. Hemoptysis, however, may also result from rupture of a dilated vessel in a cavity (Rasmussen’s aneurysm) or from aspergilloma formation in an old cavity. Pleuritic chest pain sometimes develops in patients with subpleural parenchymal lesions or pleural disease. Extensive disease may produce dyspnea and, in rare instances, adult respiratory distress syndrome. Physical findings are of limited use in pulmonary TB. Many patients have no abnormalities detectable by chest examination, whereas others have detectable rales in the involved areas during inspiration, especially after coughing. Occasionally, rhonchi due to partial bronchial obstruction and classic amphoric breath sounds in areas with large cavities may be heard. Systemic features include fever (often low-grade and intermittent) in up to 80% of cases and wasting. Absence of fever, however, does not exclude TB. In some cases, pallor and finger clubbing develop. The most common hematologic findings are mild anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis with a slightly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and/or C-reactive protein level. None of these findings is consistent or sufficiently accurate for diagnostic purposes.

Chronic cough is defined as a daily cough lasting longer than 3 weeks. Common causes of chronic cough are asthma, postnasal drip (allergic rhinitis, sinusitis), and postinfectious tussive syndromes. It can also be caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease, swallowing dysfunction (infants), anatomic abnormalities (tracheoesophageal fistula, tracheomalacia), and chronic infection. Persistent cough may also be caused by exposure to irritants (tobacco and wood stove smoke) or foreign body aspiration, or it may be psychogenic in origin.

During the first several years of life, children experience frequent viral respiratory infections, especially if they have multiple older siblings or attend day care or preschool. Cough that resolves promptly and is clearly associated with a viral infection does not require further diagnostic workup. However, cough persisting longer than 3 weeks warrants further evaluation.

Chest radiographs are useful in assessing respiratory disease in children. In addition to determining lung abnormalities, they provide information about the bony thorax (rib or vertebral abnormalities), the heart (cardiomegaly, pericardial effusion), and the great vessels (right aortic arch/vascular rings, rib notching). Chest radiographs should be obtained in both the posteroanterior (PA) and lateral projections and, if possible, following a full inspiration. Estimation of lung hyperinflation based on a single PA view is unreliable; flattened diaphragms and an increased AP diameter on lateral projection is a better indicator of hyperinflation. Crowding of the blood vessels with poor inspiration can be misinterpreted as increased markings or infiltrates. External skin folds, rotation, and motion may produce distorted or unclear images. Expiratory views and fluoroscopy may detect partial bronchial obstruction due to an aspirated foreign body that results in regional hyperinflation, because the affected lung or lobe does not deflate on exhalation. Fluoroscopy can also be used to evaluate diaphragm movement.

Signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary depending on the infecting organism and the patient’s immune status. In typical pneumonias, the usual presentation is a patient with high fever, rigors, productive cough, chills, and pleuritic chest pain. Chest radiography often will show infiltrates (11). The following agents, listed in decreasing order, cause two-thirds of all bacterial pneumonias: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus inﬂuenza, Klebsiella pneumoniae, gram-negative organisms, and anaerobic bacteria. Atypical pneumonias are more insidious in onset than typical pneumonias. Patients have moderate fever without the characteristic rigors and chills. Additional symptoms include a nonproductive cough, headache, myalgias, and mild leukocytosis. Chest radiography reveals bronchopneumonia with a diffuse interstitial pattern; characteristically, the patient does not appear to be as ill as the x-ray suggests. Common causes of atypical pneumonia include viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia pneumoniae (also called the TWAR agent), and other rare agents.

A strong index of suspicion is required for diagnosis, especially in elderly and immunocompromised individuals, who have altered response mechanisms. This is true with “typical agents.” Subtle clues in the elderly include changes in mentation, confusion, and exacerbation of other illnesses. The febrile response may be entirely absent, and the results of the physical examination are not predictive of pneumonia. In high-risk groups, an increased respiratory rate of greater than 25 breaths per minute remains the most reliable sign of infection. Mortality in these high-risk groups of patients is strongly correlated with the ability of the host to mount normal defenses to the symptoms of fever, chills, and tachycardia.

All women suspected of having pneumonia should undergo chest radiography to establish the diagnosis and to detect alternate diagnoses such as congestive heart failure and tumors.

may reveal moderate or severe respiratory distress, with inspiratory stridor and retractions of the chest wall. These findings diminish as the disease progresses and the patient tires. Conversely, oropharyngeal examination reveals infection that is much less severe than would be predicted from the symptoms—a finding that should alert the clinician to a cause of symptoms and obstruction that lies beyond the tonsils. The diagnosis often is made on clinical grounds, although direct fiberoptic laryngoscopy is frequently performed in a controlled environment (e.g., an operating room) to visualize and culture the typical edematous “cherry-red”

Clinical Manifestations and Diagnosis Epiglottitis typically presents more acutely in young children than in adolescents or adults. On presentation, most children have had symptoms for <24 h, including high fever, severe sore throat, tachycardia, systemic toxicity, and (in many cases) drooling while sitting forward. Symptoms and signs of respiratory obstruction also may be present and may progress rapidly. The somewhat milder illness in adolescents and adults often follows 1–2 days of severe sore throat and is commonly accompanied by dyspnea, drooling, and stridor. Physical examination of patients with acute epiglottitis may reveal moderate or

typical edematous “cherry-red” epiglottis and facilitate placement of an endotracheal tube. Direct visualization in an examination room (i.e., with a tongue blade and indirect laryngoscopy) is not recommended because of the risk of immediate laryngospasm and complete airway obstruction. Lateral neck radiographs and laboratory tests can assist in the diagnosis but may delay the critical securing of the airway and cause the patient to be moved or repositioned more than is necessary, thereby increasing the risk of further airway compromise. Neck radiographs typically reveal an enlarged edematous epiglottis (the “thumbprint sign,” Fig.

“thumbprint sign,” Fig. 44-3), usually with a dilated hypopharynx and normal subglottic structures. Laboratory tests characteristically document mild to moderate leukocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils. Blood cultures are positive in a significant proportion of cases.

Inspection and Palpation In patients with severe MS, there may be a malar flush with pinched and blue facies. In patients with sinus rhythm and severe pulmonary hypertension or associated tricuspid stenosis (TS), the jugular venous pulse reveals prominent a waves due to vigorous right atrial systole. The systemic arterial pressure is usually normal or slightly low. An RV tap along the left sternal border signifies an enlarged RV. A diastolic thrill may rarely be present at the cardiac apex, with the patient in the left lateral recumbent position.

Auscultation The first heart sound (S1) is usually accentuated in the early stages of the disease and slightly delayed. The pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P2) also is often accentuated with elevated PA pressures, and the two components of the second heart sound (S2) are closely split. The opening snap (OS) of the mitral valve is most readily audible in expiration at, or just medial to, the cardiac apex. This sound generally follows the sound of aortic valve closure (A2) by 0.05–0.12 s. The time interval between A2 and OS varies inversely with the severity of the MS. The OS is followed by a low-pitched, rumbling, diastolic murmur, heard best at the apex with the patient in the left lateral recumbent position (see Fig. 267-5); it is accentuated by mild exercise (e.g., a few rapid sit-ups) carried out just before auscultation. In general, the duration of this murmur correlates with the severity of the stenosis in patients with preserved CO. In patients with sinus rhythm, the murmur often reappears or becomes louder during atrial systole (presystolic accentuation). Soft, grade I or II/VI systolic murmurs are commonly heard at the apex or along the left sternal border in patients with pure MS and do not necessarily signify the presence of MR. Hepatomegaly, ankle edema, ascites, and pleural effusion, particularly in the right pleural cavity, may occur in patients with MS and RV failure.

The first heart sound is initiated at the onset of ventricular systole (

Fig. 16.42 ) and reflects closure of the AV valves. It is the loudest and longest of the heart sounds, has a crescendo-decrescendo quality, and is heard best over the apical region of the heart. The tricuspid valve sounds are heard best in the fifth intercostal space just to the left of the sternum; the mitral sounds are heard best in the fifth intercostal space at the cardiac apex.

The second heart sound, which occurs with abrupt closure of the semilunar valves (see

Fig. 16.42 ), is composed of higher frequency vibrations (higher pitch) and is of shorter duration and lower intensity than is the first heart sound. The portion of the second sound caused by closure of the pulmonic valve is heard best in the second thoracic interspace just to the left of the sternum, whereas that caused by closure of the aortic valve is heard best in the same intercostal space but to the right of the sternum. The aortic valve sound is generally louder than the pulmonic valve, but in cases of pulmonary hypertension, the reverse is true. The nature of the second heart sound changes with respiration. During expiration, a single heart sound is heard that reflects simultaneous closing of the pulmonic and aortic valves. However, during inspiration, closure of the pulmonic valve is delayed, mainly as a result of increased blood flow from an inspiration-induced increase in venous return.

With this delayed closure of the pulmonic valve, the second heart sound can be heard as two components; this is termed physiological splitting of the second heart sound.

may reveal prominence of the first heart sound with fixed splitting of the second heart sound. This results from the relatively fixed left-to-right shunt throughout all phases of the cardiac cycle. A diastolic flow murmur indicating increased flow across the tricuspid valve may be discerned, and frequently, an ejection flow mur-mur can be heard across the pulmonary valve. A right ventricu-lar heave and increased intensity of the pulmonary component of the second heart sound indicates pulmonary hypertension.Chest radiographs in the patient with an ASD demonstrate increased pulmonary vascularity, with prominent hilar mark-ings and cardiomegaly.

heart sound and eventually becomes inaudible. A right-sided fourth heart sound may emerge. The systolic murmur peaks later and may persist through the aortic component of the second heart sound (A2). Pulmonic valve 1550 closure is delayed, and the pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P2) is reduced or absent. A prominent a wave, indicative of the higher atrial pressure necessary to fill the noncompliant RV, may be seen in the jugular venous pulse. A parasternal or RV lift can be felt with significant pressure overload. Signs of right heart failure, such as

The murmur of mild or moderate PS is mid-systolic in timing, crescendo-decrescendo in configuration, heard best in the left second interspace, and usually introduced by an ejection sound (click) in younger adults whose valves are still pliable. The ejection sound is the only right-sided acoustic event that decreases in intensity with inspiration. This phenomenon reflects premature opening of the pulmonic valve by the elevated RV end-diastolic (postatrial a wave) pressure. The systolic murmur increases in intensity during inspiration. With progressively severe PS, the ejection sound moves closer to the first heart sound and eventually

More severe signs include thrombophlebitis, hyperpigmentation, lipodermato-sclerosis, ulceration, and bleeding from attenuated vein clusters.An important component of treatment for patients with vari-cose veins is the use of elastic compression stockings.

In addition, some patients have a prolonged baseline PTT due to factor deficiency or inhibitors (which could increase bleeding risk) or lupus anticoagulant (which is not associated with bleeding risk but may be associated with thrombosis risk). Using the PTT to assess heparin effect in such patients is problematic. An alternative is to use anti-Xa activity to assess heparin concentration, a test now widely available on automated coagulation instruments. This approach measures heparin concentration; however, it does not provide the global assessment of intrinsic pathway integrity of the PTT.

The following strategy is recommended: prior to initiating anticoagulant therapy of any type, the integrity of the patient’s hemostatic system should be assessed by a careful history of prior bleeding events, as well as baseline PT and PTT. If there is a prolonged clotting time, the cause of this (deficiency or inhibitor) should be determined prior to initiating therapy, and treatment goals stratified to a risk-benefit assessment. In high-risk patients measuring both the PTT and anti-Xa activity may be useful. When intermittent heparin administration is used, the aPTT or anti-Xa activity should be measured 6 hours after the administered dose to maintain prolongation of the aPTT to 2–2.5 times that of the control value. However, LMW heparin therapy is the preferred option in this case, as no monitoring is required in most patients.

Continuous intravenous administration of heparin is accomplished via an infusion pump. After an initial bolus injection of 80–100 units/kg, a continuous infusion of about 15–22 units/kg per hour is required to maintain the anti-Xa activity in the range of 0.3–0.7 units/mL. Low-dose prophylaxis is achieved with subcutaneous administration of heparin, 5000 units every 8–12 hours. Because of the danger of hematoma formation at the injection site, heparin must never be administered intramuscularly.

The pain of herniated intervertebral disc varies in severity from a mild aching discomfort to severe knife-like stabs that radiate the length of the leg and are superimposed on a constant intense ache. Sciatic pain is perceived by the patient as originating deep in the buttock and radiating to the posterolateral thigh; it may progress to the calf and ankle—to the medial malleolus (L4), lateral malleolus (L5), or heel (S1). Distal radiation to the foot is infrequent and should raise concern of an alternative process. Abortive forms of sciatica may produce aching discomfort only in the lower buttock or proximal thigh and occasionally only in the lower hamstring or upper calf. With the most severe pain, the patient is forced to stay in bed, avoiding the slightest movement; a cough, sneeze, or strain is intolerable. The most comfortable position is lying on the back with legs flexed at the knees and hips and the shoulders raised on pillows to obliterate the lumbar lordosis. For some patients, a lateral decubitus position is more comfortable. Free fragments of disc that find their way to a lateral and posterior position in the spinal canal may produce the opposite situation, one whereby the patient is unable to extend the spine and lie supine. Sitting and standing up from a sitting position are particularly painful. It is surprising to patients that a lumbar disc protrusion may cause little or no back pain. As a corollary, the presence of lumbar disc disease, even frank rupture, bears an inconsistent relationship to low back pain, as already emphasized.

In cases of root compression, pain is also characteristically provoked by pressure along the course of the sciatic nerve at the classic points of Valleix (sciatic notch, retrotrochanteric gutter, posterior surface of thigh, and head of fibula). Pressure at one point may cause radiation of pain and tingling down the leg.

As stated earlier, symptoms of the same nature as those in hysteria occur in men, most often in those trying to avoid legal difficulties or military service or attempting to obtain disability or compensation following injury. Sociopaths often present with this type of illness. Unless such a motivating factor can be identified, the diagnosis of hysteria in the male should be made with caution. In compensation neurosis, as in the classic form of hysteria, multiple symptoms are reported; many of the symptoms are the same as those listed under female hysteria. Or the patient may be monosymptomatic (e.g., “seizures”) and the symptoms, particularly chronic pain, may be confined to the neck, head, arm, or low back. The description of symptoms tends to be lengthy and circumstantial, and the patient fails to give details that are necessary for diagnosis. A tangible gain from the illness may be discovered by simple questioning. This is usually in the form of monetary compensation, which, surprisingly, is sometimes less than that which the patient could earn if he returned to work. Most such patients are actively engaged in litigation when first seen. Another interesting feature is the frequency with which the patient expresses extreme dissatisfaction with the medical care given him; he is often hostile toward the physicians and nurses. Many of these patients have already been subjected to an excessive number of hospitalizations and rather dramatic mishaps have allegedly occurred in carrying out diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The majority of these patients were previously suspected of malingering.

Curiously, women who suffer injury at work or are involved in auto accidents may exhibit the same symptoms and signs of compensation neurosis as men, but in our experience, do so infrequently or at least less overtly.

Congenital CMV infections pose a much greater problem than does rubella. There is no way of identifying the infected fetus prior to birth or to prevent inapparent infections in the pregnant woman. As indicated above, if the pregnant woman has measurable titers of antibodies to CMV at the time of conception, her infant is relatively protected. Moreover, some infected infants (with viruria) may appear normal at birth but develop neural deafness and developmental delay several years later. Viral replication in infected organs continues after the first year and health workers are at risk. A second child may be infected.

There is no known treatment. The difficulties in prenatal diagnosis of maternal infection preclude planned abortion. Routine serologic testing should be done on every young woman of childbearing age. Until an effective vaccine becomes available, pregnancy should be avoided if a sexual partner is infected.

In the United States, approximately 10 percent of cases of AIDS have occurred in women, almost all of them of childbearing age, and the rate of new cases is increasing at a faster rate among them than among men. The numbers are higher in many developing countries. In children, practically all instances of AIDS come from an HIV-infected mother (“vertical transmission”). The infection may be acquired in utero, during delivery, or from breast-feeding. The relative importance of each of these modes of transmission has not been settled.

HIV-infected pregnant women from the beginning of the second trimester through delivery and of the infant for 6 weeks following birth dramatically decreased the rate of intrapartum and perinatal transmission of HIV infection from 22.6% in the untreated group to <5%. Today, the rate of motherto-child transmission has fallen to 1% or less in pregnant women who are receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for their HIV infection. Such treatment, combined with cesarean section delivery, has rendered mother-to-child transmission of HIV an unusual event in the United States and other developed nations. In this regard, both

13-28 There are several routes by which HIV is transmitted and establishes infection.

Infection with HIV occurs after the transfer of body fluids from an infected person to an uninfected one. HIV infection is most commonly spread by sexual intercourse. Transmission by the exchange of contaminated needles used for intravenous drug delivery or by the therapeutic use of infected blood or blood products also occurs, although the latter route of transmission has largely been eliminated in countries where blood products are routinely screened for HIV. An important route of virus transmission is from an infected mother to child, which can occur in utero, during birth, or through breast milk. Rates of transmission from an untreated infected mother to her child vary (from about 15% to 45%), depending on the viral load in the mother and whether the mother breastfeeds the child, as breastfeeding increases the risk of transmission.

The use of antiretroviral drugs to decrease maternal viral load during pregnancy dramatically reduces the transmission rate to the child (see Section 1335).

As alluded to earlier, mother-to-infant transmission is the major cause of pediatric AIDS. Infected mothers can transmit the infection to their offspring by three routes: (1) in utero by transplacental spread; (2) during delivery through an infected birth canal; and (3) after birth by ingestion of breast milk. Of these, transmission during birth (intrapartum) and in the immediate period thereafter (peripartum) is considered to be the most common mode in the United States. The reported transmission rates vary from 7% to 49% in different parts of the world. Higher risk of transmission is associated with high maternal viral load and low CD4+ T cell counts as well as chorioamnionitis. Fortunately, anti-retroviral therapy given to infected pregnant women in the United States has virtually eliminated mother-to-child transmission, but it remains a major source of infection in areas where these treatments are not available.

Much concern has arisen in the lay public and among healthcare workers about the spread of HIV infection outside the high-risk groups. Extensive studies indicate that HIV infection cannot be transmitted by casual personal contact in the household, workplace, or school. Spread by insect bites is virtually impossible. Regarding transmission of HIV infection to healthcare workers, an extremely small but definite risk is present. Seroconversion has been documented after accidental needle-stick injury or exposure of nonintact skin to infected blood in laboratory accidents. After needle-stick accidents, the risk for seroconversion is believed to be about 0.3%, and antiretroviral therapy given within 24 to 48 hours of a needle stick can greatly reduce the risk of infection. By comparison, approximately 30% of those accidentally exposed to hepatitis B–infected blood become seropositive.

HIV is a nontransforming human retrovirus belonging to the lentivirus family. Included in this group are feline immunodeficiency virus, simian immunodeficiency virus, visna virus of sheep, bovine immunodeficiency virus, and the equine infectious anemia virus.

2023-11-29 14:11:45,424 query: A 53-year-old man presents to his physician’s office with a persistent cough which he has had over the last few months. He was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) the previous year and since then has been on a short-acting β-agonist to help alleviate his symptoms. Since his diagnosis, he has quit smoking, a habit which he had developed about 30 years ago. He used to smoke about 2 packs of cigarettes daily. Today, he has come in with an increase in his symptoms. He tells his physician that he has been having a fever for the past 3 days, ranging between 37.8°–39°C (100°F–102.2°F). Along with this, he has a persistent cough with copious amounts of greenish-yellow sputum. He has also been having difficulty breathing. On examination, his temperature is 38.6°C (101.5°F), the respirations are 22/min, the blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, and the pulse is 115/min. Slight crackles and respiratory wheezes are prominent in the lower lung fields. His FEV1 is 57% of his normal predicted value. He is started on oxygen and a dose of oral prednisone.

Chronic bronchitis is diagnosed on clinical grounds: it is defined by the presence of a persistent productive cough for at least 3 consecutive months in at least 2 consecutive years. It is common among cigarette smokers and urban dwellers in smog-ridden cities; some studies indicate that 20% to 25% of men in the 40to 65-year-old age group have the disease. In early stages of the disease, the cough raises mucoid sputum, but airflow is not obstructed. Some patients with chronic bronchitis have evidence of hyperresponsive airways, with intermittent bronchospasm and wheezing (asthmatic bronchitis), while other bronchitic patients, especially heavy smokers, develop chronic outflow obstruction, usually with associated emphysema (COPD).

The distinctive feature of chronic bronchitis is hypersecretion of mucus, beginning in the large airways.

are cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and the pathognomonic Koplik spots (gray-white, sand grain-sized dots on the buccal mucosa opposite the lower molars) that last 12 to 24 hours. The conjunctiva may reveal a characteristic transverse line of inflammation along the eyelid margin (Stimson line). The classic symptoms of cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis occur during the secondary viremia of the exanthematous phase, which often is accompanied by high fever (40° C to 40.5° C [104° F to 105° F]). The macular rash begins on the head (often above the hairline) and spreads over most of the body in a cephalad to caudal pattern over 24 hours. Areas of the rash often are confluent. The rash fades in the same pattern, and illness severity is related to the extent of the rash. It may be petechial or hemorrhagic (black measles). As the rash fades, it undergoes brownish discoloration and desquamation.

Cervical lymphadenitis, splenomegaly, and mesenteric lymphadenopathy with abdominal pain may be noted with the rash. Otitis media, pneumonia, and diarrhea are more common in infants. Liver involvement is more common in adults.

The term modified measles describes mild cases of measles occurring in persons with partial protection against measles. Modified measles occurs in persons vaccinated before 12 months of age or with coadministration of immune serum globulin, in infants with disease modified by transplacental antibody, or in persons receiving immunoglobulin.

Pneumonia Pneumonia is defined as inﬂammation of the distal lung that includes terminal airways, alveolar spaces, and the interstitium. Pneumonia may have multiple causes, including viral and bacterial infections or aspiration. Aspiration pneumonia is usually the result of depressed awareness commonly associated with the use of drugs and alcohol or anesthesia. Viral pneumonias are caused by multiple infectious agents, including inﬂuenza A or B, parainﬂuenza virus, or respiratory syncytial virus. Most viral syndromes are spread by aerosolization associated with coughing, sneezing, and even conversation. Incubation is short, requiring only 1 to 3 days before the acute onset of fever, chills, headache, fatigue, and myalgias. Symptom intensity is directly related to intensity of the host febrile reaction. Pneumonia develops in only 1% of patients who have a viral syndrome, but mortality rates may reach 30% in immunocompromised individuals and the elderly. An additional risk is the development of secondary bacterial pneumonias after the initial viral insult. These infections are more common in elderly patients and may explain the high fatality in this group (8). Staphylococcal pneumonias, which often arise from a previous viral infection, are extremely lethal regardless of patient age. The best treatment for viral pneumonia is prevention by immunization. Treatment is supportive and consists mostly of administration of antipyretics and ﬂuids.

Bacterial pneumonia is classified as either community acquired or nosocomial, and in many cases the classification determines prognosis and antibiotic therapy. Risk factors that contribute to mortality are chronic cardiopulmonary diseases, alcoholism, diabetes, renal failure, malignancy, and malnutrition. Prognostic features associated with poor outcome include greater than two lobe involvement, respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths per minute on presentation, severe hypoxemia (<60 mm Hg on room air), hypoalbuminemia, and septicemia. Pneumonia is a common cause of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a mortality rate between 50% and 70% (9,10).

Influenza is most frequently described as a respiratory illness characterized by systemic symptoms, such as headache, feverishness, chills, myalgia, and malaise, as well as accompanying respiratory tract signs and symptoms, particularly cough and sore throat. In some cases, the onset is so abrupt that patients can recall the precise time they became ill. However, the spectrum of clinical presentations is wide, ranging from a mild, afebrile respiratory illness similar to the common cold (with either a gradual or an abrupt onset) to severe prostration with relatively few respiratory signs and symptoms.

Imaging the brain and spinal cord is accomplished using CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CT is quick and accessible for emergency purposes. MRI provides fine detail and, with different sequences, permits detection of posterior fossa lesions, subtle cerebral abnormalities, vascular anomalies, low-grade tumors, and ischemic changes. For a child with a head injury or sudden headache, cranial CT is the study of choice because it can rapidly reveal intracranial hemorrhage or other large lesions. For a child with new-onset complex partial seizures, MRI is the study of choice, because an area of focal cortical dysplasia or other subtle lesions might not be apparent on CT. MRI also provides excellent views of the spinal cord. Cranial ultrasonography is a noninvasive bedside procedure used to visualize the brain and ventricles of infants and young children with open fontanelles.

Headache is a common symptom among children and adolescents. Headaches can be a primary problem (migraines, tension-type headaches) or secondary to another condition. Secondary headaches are most often associated with minor illnesses such as viral upper respiratory infections or sinusitis, but may be the first symptom of serious conditions (meningitis, brain tumors), so a systematic approach is necessary.

The temporal pattern of the headache must be clarified. Each pattern (acute, recurrent-episodic, chronic-progressive, chronic-nonprogressive) has its own differential diagnosis (Table 180-1).

Tension-type headaches are the most common recurrent pattern of primary headaches in children and adolescents. They are generally mild and lack associated symptoms, so are not typically disruptive to patients’ lifestyle or activities. The pain is global and squeezing or pressing in character, but can last for hours or days. There is no associated nausea, vomiting, phonophobia, or photophobia. Headaches can be related to environmental stresses or symptomatic of underlying psychiatric illnesses, such as anxiety or depression.

Migraine with Brainstem Aura (Basilar Migraine)

An uncommon form of the migraine syndrome with prominent premonitory brainstem symptoms was described by Bickerstaff. These patients, usually children with a family history of migraine, first develop visual phenomena like those of typical migraine except that they occupy much or the whole of both visual fields (temporary cortical blindness may occur). There may be associated vertigo, staggering, incoordination of the limbs, dysarthria, and tingling in both hands and feet, and sometimes around both sides of the mouth but curiously, rarely is there paralysis. These symptoms last 10 to 30 min and are followed by headache, which is usually occipital. Some patients, at the stage when the headache would have been likely to begin, may faint, and others become confused or stuporous, a state that may persist for several hours or longer. Exceptionally, there is an alarming period of coma or quadriplegia. The symptoms closely resemble those caused by ischemia in the territory of the basilar-posterior cerebral arteries—hence the name basilar, or vertebrobasilar migraine. Subsequent studies have indicated that basilar migraine, although more common in children and adolescents, affects men and women more or less equally over a wide age range, and that the condition is not always benign and transient because of rare instances with residual deficits.

The initial attack is not easily identifiable as a benign condition and various forms of imaging are reasonably performed in order to exclude basilar artery and upper brainstem disease. The issue of risk of causing stroke from the administration of intrarterial contrast is often raised and is unresolved. With recurrent similar attacks, the diagnosis becomes clearer and the use of imaging becomes less necessary.

Episodes of cyclic vomiting or periodic recurrent abdominal pain have been linked to migraine as a result of the frequent co-occurrence of these symptoms with headache or typical migraine at other times. Pallor, lethargy, and mild headache are common. This episodic disorder seems to be a problem almost exclusively of children. The results of diagnostic investigation are normal but one cannot be faulted for pursuing some form of testing with the initial occurrence of the syndrome.

Intracranial hemorrhage may be confined to one anatomicarea of the brain, such as the subdural, subarachnoid, periventricular, intraventricular, intraparenchymal, or cerebellar region. Subdural hemorrhages are seen in association with birth trauma, cephalopelvic disproportion,forceps delivery, large for gestational age infants, skull fractures, and postnatal head trauma. The subdural hematomadoes not always cause symptoms immediately after birth;with time, however, the RBCs undergo hemolysis and wateris drawn into the hemorrhage because of the high oncoticpressure of protein, resulting in an expanding symptomaticlesion. Anemia, vomiting, seizures, and macrocephaly mayoccur in an infant who is 1 to 2 months of age and has asubdural hematoma. Child abuse in this situation should be suspected and appropriate diagnostic evaluation undertaken to identify other possible signs of skeletal, ocular, or soft tissue injury. Occasionally, a massive subdural hemorrhage in the neonatal period is caused by rupture of thevein of Galen or by an inherited coagulation disorder, suchas hemophilia. Infants with these conditions exhibit shock,seizures, and coma. The treatment of all symptomatic subdural hematomas is surgical evacuation.

Subarachnoid hemorrhages may be spontaneous, associated with hypoxia, or caused by bleeding from a cerebral arteriovenous malformation. Seizures are a common presenting manifestation, and the prognosis depends on the underlying injury. Treatment is directed at the seizure and the rare occurrence of posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus.

Raskin described a headache syndrome in older patients that shares with cluster headache a nocturnal occurrence (hypnic headache). It also may occur with daytime naps. However, it differs in being bilateral and unaccompanied by lacrimation and rhinorrhea. He has successfully treated a number of his patients with 300 mg of lithium carbonate or 75 mg of sustained-release indomethacin at bedtime. The nosologic position of this hypnic headache syndrome is undetermined.

Despite these considerations, the most hazardous cause of headache in the elderly is temporal (cranial) arteritis with or without polymyalgia rheumatica, as discussed further on.

The most common cause of generalized persistent headache, both in adolescents and adults, is probably mild depression or anxiety in one of its several forms. A small group of older patients has delusional symptoms involving pain and physical distortion of cranial structures. As the psychiatric symptoms subside, the headaches usually disappear. Odd cephalic pains, for example, a sensation of having a nail driven into the head (clavus hystericus), may occur in hysteria or psychosis and raise perplexing problems in diagnosis. The bizarre character of these pains, their persistence in the face of every known therapy, the absence of other signs of disease, and the presence of other manifestations of psychiatric disease provide the basis for correct diagnosis. Older children and adolescents sometimes have peculiar behavioral reactions to headache: screaming, looking dazed, clutching the head with an agonized look. Usually, migraine is the underlying disorder in these cases, the additional manifestations responding to therapeutic support and suggestion.

Children and adolescents were affected for the most part, the disease rarely appearing beyond the age of 10 years. Typically, there is a history of primary measles infection at a very early age, often before 2 years, followed by a 6to 8-year asymptomatic period. The illness evolved in several stages. Initially there was a decline in proficiency at school, temper outbursts and other changes in personality, difficulty with language, and loss of interest in usual activities. These soon give way to a severe and progressive intellectual deterioration in association with focal or generalized seizures, widespread myoclonus, ataxia, and sometimes visual disturbances caused by progressive chorioretinitis. As the disease advances, rigidity, hyperactive reflexes, Babinski signs, progressive unresponsiveness, and signs of autonomic dysfunction appear. In the final stage, the child lies insensate, virtually “decorticated.”

The course is usually steadily progressive, death occurring within 1 to 3 years. A series of 39 such adult cases from India with mean age of 21 years was reported by Prashanth and coworkers, the oldest patient a 43-year-old. The main features were similar in most ways to childhood cases, except that several had visual disturbances and two had extrapyramidal features, raising the possibility of prion disease. Myoclonus was present early in the illness in 26 and developed later in all cases; the movements were described as “slow,” a characteristic alluded to in other series. In two cases that occurred in pregnant women, blurred vision and weakness of limbs was followed by akinetic mutism, without a trace of myoclonus or cerebellar ataxia. Nevertheless, the progressive ataxic-myoclonic chronic dementia in a child is so typical that bedside diagnosis was usually possible.

Patients are usually 1 to 3 years old, but can be as old as 6 and present with limping and pain with weight bearing. There may be minimal swelling and pain. Initial radiographs do not always show the fracture; if symptoms persist, a repeat x-ray in 7 to 10 days may be helpful.

Child abuse must always be considered in the differential diagnosis of a child with fractures, especially in those younger than 3 years (see Chapter 22). Common fracture patterns that should increase the index of suspicion include multiple fractures in different stages of radiographic healing, metaphyseal corner fractures (shaking), fractures too severe for the history, or fractures in nonambulatory infants. Although spiral fractures of long bones were historically considered pathognomic for abuse, they can be seen in nonabuse situations.

When there is concern for child abuse, the child should have a full evaluation, which may include admission to the hospital. A thorough and well-documented physical examination should focus on soft tissue injuries, the cranium, and a funduscopic examination for retinal hemorrhages or detachment. A skeletal survey or a bone scan may be helpful in identifying other fractures.

The hip is a ball (femoral head) and socket (acetabulum) joint that is important for skeletal stability. The femoral head and acetabulum are interdependent for normal growth and development. The femoral neck and head, which contain the capital femoral epiphysis, are intra-articular. The blood supply to this region is unique because the blood vessels are extraosseous and lie on the surface of the femoral neck, entering the epiphysis peripherally. Thus, the blood supply to the femoral head is vulnerable to trauma, infection, and other causes that may increase intra-articular pressure. Damage to the blood supply can lead to avascular necrosis.

common colds per year, with the most affected being younger children and children attending day care. Infection is suggested by the presence of sore throat, fever, and poor appetite, especially with a history of exposure to others with colds. Chronic infectious rhinosinusitis, or sinusitis, should be suspected if there is mucopurulent nasal discharge with symptoms that persist beyond 10 days (see Chapter 104).

Rhinitis can be divided into allergic and nonallergic rhinitis (Table 79-1). Nonallergic rhinitis describes a group of nasal diseases in which there is no evidence of allergic etiology. It can be divided further into nonanatomic and anatomic etiologies. The most common form of nonallergic rhinitis in children is infectious rhinitis, which may be acute or chronic. Acute infectious rhinitis (the common cold) is caused by viruses, including rhinoviruses and coronaviruses, and typically resolves within 7 to 10 days (see Chapter 102). An average child has three to six common colds per year,

Recommended Regimens for Androgen Replacement Testosterone esters are administered typically at doses of 75–100 mg intramuscularly every week, or 150–200 mg every 2 weeks. One or two 5-mg nongenital testosterone patches can be applied daily over the skin of the back, thigh, or upper arm away from pressure areas. Testosterone gels are typically applied over a covered area of skin at initial doses that vary with the formulation; patients should wash their hands after gel application. Bioadhesive buccal testosterone tablets at a dose of 30 mg are typically applied twice daily on the buccal mucosa.

Establishing Efficacy of Testosterone Replacement Therapy Because a clinically useful marker of androgen action is not available, restoration of testosterone levels to the mid-normal range remains the goal of therapy. Measurements of LH and FSH are not useful in assessing the adequacy of testosterone replacement. Testosterone should be measured 3 months after initiating therapy to assess adequacy of therapy. There is substantial interindividual variability in serum testosterone levels, especially with transdermal gels, presumably due to genetic differences in testosterone clearance and transdermal absorption. In patients who are treated with testosterone enanthate or cypionate, testosterone levels should be 350–600 ng/dL 1 week after the injection. If testosterone levels are outside this range, adjustments should be made either in the dose or in the interval between injections. In men on transdermal patch, gel, or buccal testosterone therapy, testosterone levels should be in the mid-normal range (500–700 ng/dL) 4–12 h after application. If testosterone levels are outside this range, the dose should be adjusted. Multiple dose adjustments are often necessary to achieve testosterone levels in the desired therapeutic range.

Prostate-Specific Antigen PSA (kallikrein-related peptidase 3; KLK3) is a kallikrein-related serine protease that causes liquefaction of seminal coagulum. It is produced by both nonmalignant and malignant epithelial cells and, as such, is prostate-specific, not prostate cancer–specific. Serum levels may also increase from prostatitis and BPH. Serum levels are not significantly affected by DRE, but the performance of a prostate biopsy can increase PSA levels up to tenfold for 8–10 weeks. PSA circulating in the blood is inactive and mainly occurs as a complex with the protease inhibitor α1-antichymotrypsin and as free (unbound) PSA forms. The formation of complexes between PSA, α2-macroglobulin, or other protease inhibitors is less significant. Free PSA is rapidly eliminated from the blood by glomerular filtration with an estimated half-life of 12–18 h. Elimination of PSA bound to α1-antichymotrypsin is slow (estimated half-life of 1–2 weeks) because it too is largely cleared by the kidneys. Levels should be undetectable after about 6 weeks if the prostate has been removed. Immunohistochemical staining for PSA can be used to establish a prostate cancer diagnosis.

Psa-Based screening and early detection PSA testing was approved by the U.S. FDA in 1994 for early detection of prostate cancer, and the widespread use of the test has played a significant role in the proportion of men diagnosed with early-stage cancers: more than 70–80% of newly diagnosed cancers are clinically organ-confined. The level of PSA in blood is strongly associated with the risk and outcome of prostate cancer. A single PSA measured at age 60 is associated (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.90) with lifetime risk of death from prostate cancer. Most prostate cancer deaths (90%) occur among men with PSA levels in the top quartile (>2 ng/mL), although only a minority of men with PSA >2 ng/mL will develop lethal prostate cancer.

No treatment for PMS has been validated by empirical studies (59). Studies of St. John’s wort, possibly the most popular alternative treatment, are contradictory (60). A number of lifestyle changes and other benign interventions alleviate symptoms for some patients with PMS (61):

Elimination of caffeine from the diet

Stress reduction can be accomplished by reducing or delegating responsibilities, insofar as that is possible, and devoting part of every day to relaxation techniques such as meditation and yoga. Many women experience stress factors over which they have no control (59).

For premenstrual dysphoric disorder, several selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) proved effective in clinical trials (62–65). Although SSRIs and all other antidepressants require about 2 weeks of daily administration to achieve therapeutic effect for other depressive disorders, it appears that ﬂuoxetine is effective for PMDD when taken in the usual daily doses for the 1 to 2 weeks preceding menstruation. The medication is packaged for this specific indication and dosage. It is thought that the mode of action of SSRIs when used in this fashion differs from that which alleviates major depression (65). Other medications for the treatment of PMS and PMDD are shown in Table 12.2. There is some interest in the role of oral contraceptives in management of PMDD, and for patients interested in contraception, trials of oral contraceptives are a reasonable approach (66). Symptoms must be carefully monitored to determine whether the hormonal intervention improves or exacerbates the problem mood changes.

dosing Warfarin is usually started at a dose of 5–10 mg. Lower doses are used for patients with CYP2C9 or VKORC1 polymorphisms, which affect the pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetics of warfarin and render patients more sensitive to the drug. The dose is then titrated to achieve the desired target INR. Because of its delayed onset of action, patients with established thrombosis or those at high risk for thrombosis are given concomitant initial treatment with a rapidly acting parenteral anticoagulant, such as heparin, LMWH, or fondaparinux. Early prolongation of the INR reflects reduction in the functional levels of factor VII. Consequently, concomitant treatment with the parenteral anticoagulant should be continued until the INR has been therapeutic for at least 2 consecutive days. A minimum 5-day course of parenteral anticoagulation is recommended to ensure that the levels of factor Xa and prothrombin have been reduced into the therapeutic range with warfarin.

Because warfarin has a narrow therapeutic window, frequent coagulation monitoring is essential to ensure that a therapeutic anticoagulant response is maintained. Even patients with stable warfarin dose requirements should have their INR determined every 3–4 weeks. More frequent monitoring is necessary when new medications are introduced because so many drugs enhance or reduce the anticoagulant effects of warfarin.

A 59-year-old woman presents to an urgent care clinic with a 4-day history of frequent and painful urination. She has had fevers, chills, and flank pain for the past 2 days. Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5°C [101.3°F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug interactions?

The basic formulas of the sulfonamides and their structural similarity to p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) are shown in Figure 46–1. Sulfonamides with varying physical, chemical, pharmacologic, and antibacterial properties are produced by attaching substituents to the amido group ( ⎯ SO2 ⎯ NH ⎯ R) or the amino group ( ⎯ NH2) of the sulfanilamide nucleus. Sulfonamides tend to be much more soluble at alkaline than at acid pH. Most can be prepared as sodium salts, which are used for intravenous administration.

Other Causes Other serious but rare causes of vaginal bleeding include vaginal tumors. The most common tumor in the prepubertal age group is a rhabdomyosarcoma (sarcoma botryoides), which is associated with bleeding and a grapelike clustered mass (see Chapter 36). Other forms of vaginal tumor are rare but should be ruled out with a thorough examination under anesthesia with vaginoscopy if no other obvious external source of bleeding is found.

Diagnosis of Prepubertal Bleeding

Hormonally active ovarian tumors can cause endometrial proliferation and bleeding. Likewise, exogenously administered estrogens can result in bleeding. Rarely, bleeding can result from the prolonged use of topical estrogens prescribed as therapy for vulvovaginitis or labial adhesions or from accidental ingestion of prescription estrogens.

Examination A careful examination is indicated when a child has genital symptoms. The technique of examining the prepubertal child is described in Chapter 1. If no obvious cause of bleeding is visible externally or within the distal vagina, an examination can be performed using anesthesia with vaginoscopy to completely visualize the vagina and cervix. This examination should be performed by a clinician who has experience in pediatric and adolescent gynecology.

Abnormal bleeding, either intermenstrual or postcoital, can be caused by cervical lesions. Bleeding can result from endocervical polyps and infectious cervical lesions, such as condylomata, herpes simplex virus ulcerations, chlamydial cervicitis, or cervicitis caused by other organisms. Other benign cervical lesions, such as wide eversion of endocervical columnar epithelium or nabothian cysts, may be detected on examination but rarely cause bleeding.

Diagnosis of Abnormal Bleeding in Reproductive-Age Women

Coagulopathies and Other Hematologic Causes of Abnormal in Reproductive-Age Women As with adolescents, hematologic causes of abnormal bleeding should be considered in women with heavy menstrual bleeding, particularly in those who had abnormal bleeding since menarche. Of all women with menorrhagia, 5% to 20% have a previously undiagnosed bleeding disorder, primarily von Willebrand’s disease (171). Table 14.8 presents guidelines for a gynecologist’s suspicion of a bleeding disorder and pursuit of a diagnosis (81). Abnormal liver function, which can be seen with alcoholism or other chronic liver diseases, results in inadequate production of clotting factors and can lead to excessive menstrual bleeding.

Infections Causes As in adolescents, menorrhagia can be the first sign of endometritis in women infected with sexually transmissible organisms. Women with cervicitis, particularly chlamydial cervicitis, can experience irregular bleeding and postcoital spotting (see Chapter 18). Therefore, cervical testing for C. trachomatis should be considered, especially for adolescents, women in their 20s, and women who are not in a monogamous relationship. Endometritis can cause excessive menstrual ﬂow. Thus, a woman who seeks treatment for menorrhagia and increased menstrual pain and has a history of light-to-moderate previous menstrual ﬂow may have an upper genital tract infection or PID (endometritis, salpingitis, oophoritis). Occasionally, chronic endometritis will be diagnosed when an endometrial biopsy is obtained for evaluation of abnormal bleeding in a patient without specific risk factors for PID.

Sharp, fleeting chest pain or a prolonged, dull ache localized to the 1581 left submammary area is rarely due to myocardial ischemia. However, especially in women and diabetic patients, angina pectoris may be atypical in location and not strictly related to provoking factors. In addition, this symptom may exacerbate and remit over days, weeks, or months. Its occurrence can be seasonal, occurring more frequently in the winter in temperate climates. Anginal “equivalents” are symptoms of myocardial ischemia other than angina. They include dyspnea, nausea, fatigue, and faintness and are more common in the elderly and in diabetic patients.

Systematic questioning of a patient with suspected IHD is important to uncover the features of an unstable syndrome associated with increased risk, such as angina occurring with less exertion than in the past, occurring at rest, or awakening the patient from sleep. Since coronary atherosclerosis often is accompanied by similar lesions in other arteries, a patient with angina should be questioned and examined for peripheral arterial disease (intermittent claudication [Chap. 302]), stroke, or transient ischemic attacks (Chap. 446). It is also important to uncover a family history of premature IHD (<55 years in first-degree male relatives and <65 in female relatives) and the presence of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, cigarette smoking, and other risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis (Chap. 291e).

are symptomatic and invariably present with compensatory tachycardia, often associated with acute pulmonary congestion and cardiogenic shock.2 Because the left ventricular and aortic pressures often equalize before the end of diastole, the diastolic murmur of AI may be short and/or soft. The reduced systolic pressure may attenuate the increase in peripheral pulse pressure seen in chronic AI, and early closing of the mitral valve due to elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressures may diminish the intensity of the first heart sound in the acute setting.In patients with chronic AI, symptoms of heart fail-ure and

document (2) 

Diastolic Murmurs In contrast to some systolic murmurs, diastolic heart murmurs always signify structural heart disease (Fig. 267-5). The murmur associated with acute, severe AR is relatively soft and of short duration because of the rapid rise in LV diastolic pressure and the progressive diminution of the aortic-LV diastolic pressure gradient. In contrast, the murmur of chronic severe AR is classically heard as a decrescendo, blowing diastolic murmur along the left sternal border in patients with primary valve pathology and sometimes along the right sternal border in patients with primary aortic root pathology.

With chronic AR, the pulse pressure is wide 1449 and the arterial pulses are bounding in character. These signs of significant diastolic run-off are absent in the acute phase. The murmur of pulmonic regurgitation is also heard along the left sternal border. It is most commonly due to pulmonary hypertension and enlargement of the annulus of the pulmonic valve. S2 is single and loud and may be palpable. There is a right ventricular/parasternal lift that is indicative of chronic right ventricular pressure overload. A less impressive murmur of PR is present after repair of tetralogy of Fallot or pulmonic valve atresia. In this postoperative setting, the murmur is softer and lower-pitched, and the severity of the accompanying pulmonic regurgitation can be underestimated significantly.

History and Physical Examination The chest discomfort, often severe enough to be described as frank pain, is typically located in the sub-sternal region or sometimes in the epigastrium, and radiates to the left arm, left shoulder, and/or neck. Anginal “equivalents” such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension.

Electrocardiogram ST-segment depression occurs in 20 to 25% of patients; it may be transient in patients without biomarker evidence of myocardial necrosis, but may be persistent for several days in NSTEMI. T-wave changes are common but are less specific signs of ischemia, unless they are new and deep T-wave inversions (≥0.3 mV).

An infant should be treated at birth if the treatment status of the seropositive mother is unknown; if the mother has received inadequate or nonpenicillin therapy; if the mother received penicillin therapy in the third trimester; or if the infant may be difficult to follow. The CSF should be examined to obtain baseline values before treatment. Penicillin is the only recommended drug for the treatment of syphilis in infants. Specific recommendations for the treatment of infants and older children are included in the CDC’s 2010 treatment guidelines.

1140 ARISCH-HERXHEIMER REACTIoN A dramatic although usually mild reaction consisting of fever, chills, myalgias, headache, tachycardia, increased respiratory rate, increased circulating neutrophil count, and vasodilation with mild hypotension may follow the initiation of treatment for syphilis. This reaction is thought to be a response to lipoproteins released by dying T. pallidum organisms. The arisch-Herxheimer reaction occurs in 50of patients with primary syphilis, of those with secondary syphilis, and a lower proportion of persons with later-stage disease. Defervescence takes place within 12–2 h. In patients with secondary syphilis, erythema and edema of the mucocutaneous lesions may increase. Patients should be warned to expect such symptoms, which can be managed with symptom-based treatment. Steroid or other anti-inflammatory therapy is not reuired for this mild transient reaction.

Efficacy of treatment should be assessed by clinical evaluation and monitoring of the uantitative L or P titer for a fourfold decline (e.g., from 12 to 1). Patients with primary or secondary syphilis should be examined  and 12 months after treatment and persons with latent or late syphilis at , 12, and 2 months. More freuent clinical and serologic examination (, ,  12, and 2 months) is recommended for patients concurrently infected with HI regardless of the stage of syphilis.

In most cases, a careful history can lead to a correct diagnosis. Questions should include history of premature birth, prior apnea, level of consciousness at the time of the event, presence or absence of respiratory effort, limpness or stiffness, jerking movements (seizure), feeding history, intercurrent illnesses, any trauma, and the social situation of the family. The physical examination should focus on bruising and injury, the general and neurologic condition of the infant, nutritional status, respiratory pattern, and cardiac status. The laboratory evaluation may include serum electrolytes, serum glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell count, a chest radiograph, and blood gas analysis. Testing for respiratory viruses and pertussis in patients with evidence of respiratory infection should occur. If gastroesophageal reflux is suspected, a barium swallow or pH probe study may be useful. Cardiorespiratory monitoring for 12 to 24 hours in the hospital can provide information on respiratory and cardiac patterns and feeding difficulties (choking, gagging, emesis); provide time to get more history and assess the home situation; and alleviate parental anxiety. Useful tests to determine CNS causes include a head computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) (for seizures).

There are no standard recommendations for when home monitoring should be prescribed. Polysomnography is not useful in predicting which children with ALTEs are likely to progress to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The key to prevention of future events is to identify the underlying cause and treat it. Teaching parents infant cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and attempting to alleviate anxiety surrounding the event are recommended.

If the heart rate remains � 100 bpm after 5 to 10 positive pressure breaths, the attempted ventilation is inadequate and corrective steps must be taken. These can be remembered by the pneumonic MR. SOPA (Table 32-1). The two most common problems are mask leak due to an inefective seal and malposition of the airway (Schmolzer, 2011). If corrective steps do not improve the heart rate, either intubation with an endotracheal tube or placement of a laryngeal mask airway is required.

If mask ventilation is inefective or prolonged, an alternative airway is placed. For tracheal intubation, a laryngoscope with a straight blade-size 0 for a preterm newborn and size 1 for a term neonate-is used. Gentle cricoid pressure may be useful. An increasing heart rate and ETC02 detection after several breaths are the primary methods of conirming intubation of the trachea and not the esophagus. One can also look for symmetrical chest wall motion; auscultate for equal breath sounds, especially in the axillae; and auscultate for the absence of breath sounds or gurgling over the stomach.

Once in place, the tube is used for tracheal suctioning only for a suspected obstructed airway. Otherwise, an appropriate positive-pressure device is attached to the endotracheal tube. Air pufs are delivered at a rate of 40 to 60 per minute with a force adequate to stabilize the heart rate. In term infants, opening pressures of 30 to 40 cm H20 typically will expand the alveoli without causing barotrauma. Once the lung is inflated, less pressure is typically needed (20 to 25 cm

H20). For preterm infants, pressures of 20 to 25 cm

With oxygen deprivation and carbon dioxide (C02) elevation, there is a transient period of rapid breathing, and if it persists, breathing stops, which is termed primay apnea. This stage is accompanied by a fall in heart rate and loss of neuromuscular tone. Simple stimulation will usually reverse primary apnea. If oxygen deprivation and asphyxia persist, however, the newborn will develop deep gasping respirations, followed by seconday apnea. This latter stage is associated with a further decline in heart rate, fall in blood pressure, and loss of neuromuscular tone. Neonates in secondary apnea will not respond to stimulation and will not spontaneously resume respiratory eforts. Unless ventilation is assisted, death follows.

Clinically, primary and secondary apneas are indistinguishable, and thus, secondary apnea must be assumed. And, when a response to stimulation is not immediate, resuscitation with efective ventilation of the apneic newborn must be started quickly.

Immediately after birth and usually during the delay for umbilical cord clamping, newborn tone, respiratory efort, and heart rate are evaluated (Fig. 32-2). :Most term neonates are vigorous by 10 to 30 seconds after birth (Ersdal, 2012). For these, initial steps of warming the newborn can be done on the mother's chest or abdomen. Direct skin-to-skin contact with the mother and drying and covering the newborn with a warm blanket will help maintain euthermia (36.5 to 37.5°C). A vigorously crying newborn does not require routine oral suctioning (Carrasco, 1997; Gungor, 2006). Instead, bulb suctioning to remove secretions is best reserved for those who cannot clear secretions on their own due to apnea or copious secretions. Additional routine care steps include drying, gentle stimulation by rubbing the newborn's back, and continued observation during the transition period.

If not vigorous or if preterm, the neonate is carried to a prewarmed radiant warmer for the initial newborn care steps.

Biopsy of nonpalpable lesions is a potentially difficult procedure that requires close cooperation between the surgeon and radiologist. Using ultrasonographic, mammographic, or MRI guidance, a needle or specialized wire is placed into the breast parenchyma at or near the site of the suspected abnormality. Some mammographers will inject a biologic dye into the breast parenchyma to assist localization. The surgeon reviews the films and localizes the abnormality with respect to the tip of the wire or needle. Alternatively, the surgeon will perform ultrasonography intraoperatively to directly localize the lesion. An incision is made directly over the abnormality, and a small portion of the breast tissue suspected of containing the abnormality is excised. For mammographically detected lesions, a specimen radiograph is obtained to ensure that the abnormality has been recovered. Often, the radiologist can place a needle in the specimen at the site of the abnormality to facilitate histologic evaluation and ensure that the pathologist examines the site of the abnormality. Image-guided biopsy should be performed only for lesions inaccessible to needle biopsy or those lesions that may be associated with malignancy such as ADH.

Breast cancer may arise in the intermediate-size ducts, terminal ducts, or lobules. In most cases, the diagnosis of lobular and intraductal carcinoma is based more on histologic appearance than site of origin. The cancer may be either in situ (ductal carcinoma in situ or lobular carcinoma in situ) or invasive (infiltrating ductal carcinoma, infiltrating lobular carcinoma). Morphologic subtypes of infiltrating ductal carcinoma include scirrhous, tubular, medullary, and mucinous carcinoma.

Bronchoscopy is the process of direct visualization of the tracheobronchial tree. Although bronchoscopy is now performed almost exclusively with flexible fiberoptic instruments, rigid bronchoscopy, generally performed in an operating room on a patient under general anesthesia, still has a role in selected circumstances, primarily because of a larger suction channel and the fact that the patient can be ventilated through the bronchoscope channel. These situations include the retrieval of a foreign body and the suctioning of a massive hemorrhage, for which the small suction channel of the bronchoscope may be insufficient.

This outpatient procedure is usually performed in an awake but sedated patient (conscious sedation). The bronchoscope is passed through either the mouth or the nose, between the vocal cords, and into the trachea. The ability to flex the scope makes it possible to visualize virtually all airways to the level of subsegmental bronchi. The bronchoscopist is able to identify endobronchial pathology, including tumors, granulomas, bronchitis, foreign bodies, and sites of bleeding. Samples from airway lesions can be taken by several methods, including washing, brushing, and biopsy. Washing involves instillation of sterile saline through a channel of the bronchoscope and onto the surface of a lesion. A portion of the liquid is collected by suctioning through the bronchoscope, and the recovered material can be analyzed for cells (cytology) or organisms (by standard stains and cultures). Brushing or biopsy of the surface of the lesion, using a small brush or biopsy forceps at the end of a long cable inserted through a channel of the bronchoscope, allows recovery of cellular material or tissue for analysis by standard cytologic and histopathologic methods.

Chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are associated with changes in the abundance of CC16 in airway ﬂuid and serum. CC16 is used as a measurable pulmonary marker in bronchoalveolar lavage ﬂuid and serum. Secretion of CC16 into the bronchial tree decreases during lung injury (because of damage to the Clara cells), whereas serum levels of CC16 may increase because of leakage across the air–blood barrier.

Smooth-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum (sER) and secretory vesicles are chiefly in the apical cytoplasm. One of the secretory vesicles is shown discharging its contents onto the surface of the cell.

Respiratory bronchioles are the first part of the bronchial tree that allows gas exchange.

Respiratory bronchioles constitute a transitional zone in the respiratory system; they are involved in both air conduction and gas exchange. They have a narrow diameter and are lined by cuboidal epithelium. The epithelium of the initial segments of the respiratory bronchioles contains both ciliated cells and Clara cells (see Fig. 19.12). Distally, Clara cells predominate. Occasional brush cells and dense-core granule cells are also present along the length of the respiratory bronchiole. Scattered, thin-walled outpocketings, alveoli, extend from the lumen of the respiratory bronchioles (see Fig. 19.11). Alveoli are the sites at which air leaves and enters the bron chiole to allow gas exchange.

Alveoli are the site of gas exchange.

Other important hormonal changes also occur in conjunction with puberty. Growth hormone (GH) levels increase early in puberty, stimulated in part by the pubertal increases in estrogen secretion. GH increases insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), which enhances linear growth. The growth spurt is generally less pronounced in girls than in boys, with a peak growth velocity of ~7 cm/year. Linear growth is ultimately limited by closure of epiphyses in the long bones as a result of prolonged exposure to estrogen. Puberty is also associated with mild insulin resistance.

The differential diagnosis of precocious and delayed puberty is similar in boys (Chap. 411) and girls. However, there are differences in the timing of normal puberty and differences in the relative frequency of specific disorders in girls compared with boys.

Precocious Puberty Traditionally, precocious puberty has been defined as the development of secondary sexual characteristics before the age of 8 in girls based on data from Marshall and Tanner in British girls studied in the 1960s. More recent studies led to recommendations that girls be evaluated for precocious puberty if breast development or pubic hair is present at <7 years of age for white girls or <6 years for black girls.

The spectrum of normal sexual response varies from one woman to another and throughout a woman’s lifetime (1–3). Physicians should be aware of their patients’ sexual values, attitudes about specific practices, and concerns about their sexuality. Maintaining open communication with patients about their sexuality allows the physician to counsel them about sexual issues and problems and other aspects of their reproductive health.

Sexual Activity Sexual activity among adolescents in the United States increased during the past 20 years (3). The average age for first intercourse for both men and women is 16 years. By 19 years of age, as many as three-quarters of women have had intercourse. Most young men and young women have multiple serial sexual partners but use condoms inconsistently, thereby exposing themselves to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and unintended pregnancies. A recent study of North American women, using a large and diverse community-based sample, shows that of the 3,205 women aged 30 to 79 years almost one-half were not sexually active in the previous 4 weeks, with 52% of those citing lack of interest and 61% citing lack of partner as the major reasons. Of those who were sexually active recently, 13.7% noted sexual problems and dissatisfaction with their overall sexual lives (4).

Women age 45 to 54 years should be screened annually, and those 55 years and older should transi-tion to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue annual screening. Women should have the opportunity to begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years and should continue screening

Menopause, the permanent cessation of menstruation, occurs at a mean age of 51 years. Despite a great increase in the life expectancy of women, the age at menopause remains remarkably constant. A woman in the United States today will live approximately 30 years, or greater than a third of her life, beyond the menopause. The age at menopause appears to be genetically determined and is unaffected by race, socioeconomic status, age at menarche, or number of prior ovulations. Factors that are toxic to the ovary often result in an earlier age of menopause; women who

menopause; women who smoke experience an earlier menopause, as do many women exposed to chemotherapy or pelvic radiation (1). Women who had surgery on their ovaries or had a hysterectomy, despite retention of their ovaries, may experience early menopause (2). Premature ovarian insufficiency, defined as menopause before the age of 40 years, occurs in approximately 1% of women. It may be idiopathic or associated with a toxic exposure, chromosomal abnormality, or an autoimmune disorder.

The well-developed facial lesions (adenomas of

Pringle), pathognomonic of tuberous sclerosis, are present in 90 percent of patients older than 4 years of age. Although called adenoma sebaceum, these nodules are actually angiofibromas; the sebaceous glands are only passively involved (Fig. 37-5). Typically they are red to pink nodules with a smooth, glistening surface, and they tend to be limited to the nasolabial folds, cheeks, and chin; sometimes they also involve the forehead and scalp. The earliest manifestation of facial angiofibromatosis may be a mild erythema over the cheeks and forehead that is intensified by crying. The occurrence of large plaques of connective tissue on the forehead is usually expressive of a severe form of the disease.

On the trunk, the diagnostic lesion is the “shagreen patch” (in reality a plaque of subepidermal fibrosis) found most often in the lumbosacral region. It appears as a flat, slightly elevated, flesh-colored area of skin 1 to 10 cm in diameter, with a “pigskin,” “elephant hide,” or “orange peel” appearance (Fig. 37-6). Another common site of fibromatous involvement is the nail bed; subungual fibromas usually appear at puberty and continue to develop with age. Other common skin changes, not in themselves diagnostic, include fibroepithelial tags (soft fibromas), café-au-lait spots, and port-wine hemangiomas.

Lesions often appear in sun-exposed areas, particularly the tip of the nose, and have a propensity to occur in areas of trauma (Koebner phenomenon). Because of the vascular nature of the tumors and the presence of extravasated red blood cells in the lesions, their colors range from reddish to purple to brown and often take the appearance of a bruise, with yellowish discoloration and

Fibromas are submucosal nodular fibrous tissue masses that are formed when chronic irritation results in reactive connective tissue hyperplasia (

These lesions are richly vascular and typically ulcerated, which gives them a red to purple color. In some cases, growth can be rapid and raise fear of a malignant neoplasm. However, histologic examination demonstrates a proliferation of immature vessels similar to that seen in granulation tissue. Pyogenic granulomas may regress, mature into dense fibrous masses, or develop into a peripheral ossifying fibroma. Complete surgical excision is definitive treatment.

The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly.

The plasma Na+ concentration on admission was 113 meq/L, with a creatinine of 2.35 (Table 64e-1). At hospital hour 7, the plasma Na+ concentration was 120 meq/L, potassium 5.4 meq/L, chloride 90 64e-5 meq/L, bicarbonate 22 meq/L, BUN 32 mg/dL, creatinine 2.02 mg/dL, glucose 89 mg/dL, total protein 5.0, and albumin 1.9. The hematocrit was 33.9, white count 7.6, and platelets 405. A morning cortisol was 19.5, with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 1.7. The patient was treated with 1 μg of intravenous DDAVP, along with 75 mL/h of intravenous half-normal saline. After the plasma Na+ concentration dropped to 116 meq/L, intravenous fluid was switched to normal saline at the same infusion rate. The subsequent results are shown in Table 64e-1.

This patient presented with hypovolemic hyponatremia and a “prerenal” reduction in GFR, with an increase in serum creatinine. She had experienced diarrhea for some time and manifested an orthostatic tachycardia after a liter of normal saline. As expected for hypovolemic hyponatremia, the urine Na+ concentration was <20 meq/L in the absence of congestive heart failure or other causes of hypervolemic hyponatremia, and she responded to saline hydration with an increase in plasma Na+ concentration and a decrease in creatinine.

A 32-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with weakness and hypokalemia. The patient had been very healthy until 2 months previously when he developed intermittent leg weakness. His review of systems was otherwise negative. He denied drug or laxative abuse and was on no medications. Past medical history was unremarkable, with no history of neuromuscular disease. Family history was notable for a sister with thyroid disease. Physical examination was notable only for reduced deep tendon reflexes.

This patient developed hypokalemia due to a redistribution of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular compartments; this pathophysiology was readily apparent following calculation of the TTKG. The TTKG is calculated as (P × U )/(P ×

U ). The expected values for the TTKG are <3 in the presence of hypokalemia and >7–8 in the presence of hyperkalemia (see also Case 2 and Case 8). Alternatively, a urinary K+-to-creatinine ratio of >13 mmol/g creatinine (>1.5 mmol/mmol creatinine) is compatible with excessive renal K+ excretion. In this case, the calculated TTKG was 2.5, consistent with appropriate renal conservation of K+ and a nonrenal cause for hypokalemia. In the absence of significant gastrointestinal loss of K+, the patient was diagnosed with a “redistributive” subtype of hypokalemia.

Rheumatoid factor positive, anti-Ro/SS-A positive, and anti-La/SS-B positive pH = 6.0, normal sediment without white or red blood cell casts and no bacteria. The urine protein-to-creatinine ratio was 0.150 g/g. Urinary electrolyte values were: Na+ 35, K+ 40, Cl− 18 meq/L. Therefore, the urine anion gap was positive, indicating low urine NH4+ excretion.

For this patient, the CeH2O was 2.5 L/d when initially evaluated, i.e., with urine Na+ and K+ concentrations of 34 and 5.2 meq/L, plasma Na+ concentration of 150 meq/L, and a urinary volume of 3.4 L. Therefore, the patient was given 2.5 L of D5W over the first 24 h to replace ongoing free water losses, along with 2.1 L of D5W to replace half his free water deficit. Daily random urine electrolytes and urinary volume measurement can be used to monitor CeH2O and adjust daily fluid administration in this manner, while following plasma Na+ concentration. Physicians often calculate the free water deficit to guide therapy of hypernatremia, providing half the deficit in the first 24 h. This approach can be adequate in patients who do not have significant ongoing losses of free water, e.g., with hypernatremia due to decreased free water intake. This case illustrates how free water requirements can be grossly underestimated in hypernatremic patients if ongoing, daily free water losses are not taken into account.

A 78-year-old man was admitted with pneumonia and hyponatremia. Plasma Na+ concentration was initially 129 meq/L, decreasing within 3 days to 118–120 meq/L despite fluid restriction to 1 L/d. A chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a right 2.8 × 1.6 cm infrahilar mass and postobstructive pneumonia. The patient was an active smoker. Past medical history was notable for laryngeal carcinoma treated 15 years prior with radiation therapy, renal cell carcinoma, peripheral vascular disease, and hypothyroidism. On review of systems, he denied headache, nausea, and vomiting. He had chronic hip pain, managed with acetaminophen with codeine. Other medications included cilostazol, amoxicillin/clavulanate, digoxin, diltiazem, and thyroxine. He was euvolemic on examination, with no lymphadenopathy and a normal chest examination.

This is an oblique fracture of the distal tibia without a fibula fracture. There is often no significant trauma. Patients are usually 1 to 3 years old, but can be as old as 6 and present with limping and pain with weight bearing. There may be minimal swelling and pain. Initial radiographs do not always show the fracture; if symptoms persist, a repeat x-ray in 7 to 10 days may be helpful.

Child abuse must always be considered in the differential diagnosis of a child with fractures, especially in those younger than 3 years (see Chapter 22). Common fracture patterns that should increase the index of suspicion include multiple fractures in different stages of radiographic healing, metaphyseal corner fractures (shaking), fractures too severe for the history, or fractures in nonambulatory infants. Although spiral fractures of long bones were historically considered pathognomic for abuse, they can be seen in nonabuse situations.

When there is concern for child abuse, the child should have a full evaluation, which may include admission to the hospital. A thorough and well-documented physical examination should focus on soft tissue injuries, the cranium, and a funduscopic examination for retinal hemorrhages or detachment. A skeletal survey or a bone scan may be helpful in identifying other fractures.

The hip is a ball (femoral head) and socket (acetabulum) joint that is important for skeletal stability. The femoral head and acetabulum are interdependent for normal growth and development. The femoral neck and head, which contain the capital femoral epiphysis, are intra-articular. The blood supply to this region is unique because the blood vessels are extraosseous and lie on the surface of the femoral neck, entering the epiphysis peripherally. Thus, the blood supply to the femoral head is vulnerable to trauma, infection, and other causes that may increase intra-articular pressure. Damage to the blood supply can lead to avascular necrosis.

document (1) 

Unfortunately for this patient, the sole blood supply to the head of the femur was via the vessels in the retinacula fibers, which were transected at the time of the fracture. If the patient had an intertrochanteric fracture instead, the vessels of the retinacula fibers would not have been damaged and a different approach to surgical fixation could be undertaken without the need for a hemiarthroplasty.

The patient has osteoporosis.

Osteoporosis is a common condition affecting older people, but is significantly more frequent in postmenopausal women. Many fractures of the femoral neck in elderly patients occur because the strength of the bone is significantly reduced when it is osteoporotic. Other common sites for osteoporotic fractures include the distal radius and the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae.

A 28-year-old woman was seen by her family practitioner for a routine pregnancy checkup at 36 weeks’ gestational age. Neither the patient nor the family physician had any concerns about the pregnancy. However, the patient did complain of unilateral swelling of her left leg, which had gradually increased over the previous 2 days. Furthermore, the evening before her visit she developed some sharp chest pain, which was exacerbated by deep breaths.

The family physician ordered a duplex ultrasound scan of the left leg venous system.

Ultrasound scanning of the vascular tree can demonstrate flow and occlusion of arteries and veins.

The probe was placed over the left femoral vein and no flow was demonstrated. Furthermore, the vein could not be compressed, and no alteration of flow with breathing could be demonstrated. Some flow was demonstrated in the deep femoral vein and in the great saphenous vein. No flow was demonstrated throughout the length of the left femoral vein, the popliteal vein, and the tibial veins.

The technician scanned the opposite side, where excellent flow was demonstrated within the right femoral venous system. In addition, when the calf was gently massaged an augmentation to the flow was noted. It was possible to demonstrate alteration of flow with respiratory excursion and venous compression was satisfactory. A diagnosis of extensive left-sided deep vein thrombosis was made.

Certain patients are more prone to deep vein thrombosis.

Also known as nonaccidental trauma; includes neglect as well as physical, sexual, and psychological maltreatment of children. Suspect abuse if the history is discordant with physical findings or if there is a delay in obtaining appropriate medical care. Certain injuries in children such as retinal hemorrhages and specific fracture types are pathognomonic for abuse.

Abuse or neglect in infants may present as apnea, seizures, feeding intolerance, excessive irritability or somnolence, or failure to thrive (FTT).

Neglect in older children may present as poor hygiene or behavioral abnormalities.

Exam findings may include the following:

Injuries in atypical places (e.g., the face or thighs) or patterns (stockingglove burns, cigarette burns, belt marks).

Spiral fractures of the humerus and femur (strongly suggest abuse in children < 3 years of age) or epiphyseal/metaphyseal “bucket fractures,” which suggest shaking or jerking of the child’s limbs.

document (3) 

Posterior rib fractures.

Genital trauma, bleeding, or discharge.

Rule out conditions that mimic abuse—e.g., bleeding disorders or Mongolian spots (bruises), osteogenesis imperfecta (fractures), bullous impetigo (cigarette burns), and “coining” (an alternative treatment in certain cultures).

A skeletal survey and bone scan can show fractures in various stages of healing.

Test for gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, and HIV if sexual abuse is suspected.

Rule out shaken baby syndrome (SBS) by performing an ophthalmologic exam for retinal hemorrhages and a noncontrast CT for subdural hematomas. Infants with SBS often do not exhibit external signs of abuse.

Consider an MRI to visualize white matter changes (diffuse axonal injury associated with violent shaking) and the extent of intraand extracranial bleeds. MRI often requires the young patient to be sedated and/or intubated, while CT usually does not.

Document injuries, including location, size, shape, color, and the nature of all lesions, bruises, or burns.

Notify child protective services (CPS) for evaluation and possible removal of the child from the home.

Hospitalize if necessary to stabilize injuries or to protect the child.

Consider abuse if the caretaker’s story and the child’s injuries don’t match.

Reporting any suspicion of child abuse is mandatory; you cannot be sued for doing so.

Intrauterine risk factors for congenital heart disease include maternal drug use (alcohol, lithium, thalidomide, phenytoin), maternal infections (rubella), and maternal illness (DM, PKU). Disease is classified by the presence or absence of cyanosis:

Extension of the catheter into the pulmonary artery allows measurement of pulmonary artery pressures as well as pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (reflecting left ventricular end diastolic pres-sure) with an occlusive balloon. In addition to these measure-ments, cardiac output can be measured using thermodilution or by the Fick method using oxygen saturations of blood sampled from the various locations during the procedure.Brunicardi_Ch21_p0801-p0852.indd   80601/03/19   5:32 PM 807ACQUIRED HEART DISEASECHAPTER 21Figure 21-2. Cardiac catheterization angiography.

Left Heart Catheterization This procedure measures pressures in the left heart as a determinant of left ventricular performance. With the aid of fluoroscopy, a catheter is guided to the ascending aorta and across the aortic valve into the left ventricle to provide a direct measure of left ventricular pressure. In patients with a tilting-disc prosthetic aortic valve, crossing the valve with a catheter is contraindicated, and the left heart may be accessed via a transseptal technique from the right atrium using a needle-tipped catheter to puncture the atrial septum at the fossa ovalis. Once the catheter crosses from the right to the left atrium, it can be advanced across the mitral valve to the left ventricle. This technique is also used for mitral valvuloplasty. Heparin is given for prolonged procedures to limit the risk of stroke from embolism of clots that may form on the catheter. For patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, the direct thrombin inhibitors bivalirudin (0.75 mg/kg bolus, 1.75 mg/kg per hour for the duration of the procedure) or argatroban (350 μg/kg bolus, 15 μg/kg per minute for the duration of the procedure) may be used.

A comprehensive hemodynamic assessment involves obtaining pressure measurements in the right and left heart and peripheral arterial system and determining the cardiac output (Table 272-2). The shape

The in utero position of the fetus can affect the angular and torsional alignment (temporary or permanent) of the skeletal system, especially of the lower extremity (Fig. 197-3). The newborn’s hips are externally rotated. Pes planus and genu varum are common. Infants are usually born with a flexed posture. This position usually decreases to neutral within the first 4 to 6 months. The foot is often flat and tucked under at birth; the ankle will be inverted and the forefoot is adducted when compared with the hindfoot. The lateral border of the foot must straighten out, even with dorsiflexion, to be considered secondary to in utero positioning.

The head and neck may also be distorted by in utero positioning. The spine and upper extremities are less likely to be affected. By the age of 3 to 4 years, the effects of in utero positioning have usually resolved.

Normal gait has a stance phase and swing phase; each legshould have symmetrical timing with each phase. The

(From Tachjidan MO: Congenital Dislocation of the Hip, New York, 1982, Churchill Livingstone, p 105.) stance phase represents 60% of the gait and begins with footcontact (usually the heel strike) and ends with the toe-off.During the swing phase (40%), the foot is off the ground.The gait cycle is the interval between stance phases on thesame limb.

Toddlers will generally walk independently by 18 months of age. Their externally rotated gait is usually inconsistent, is characterized by short, rapid steps, and does not have the reciprocal arm swing. Gait coordination improves over time, with a normal gait usually achieved by the time a child enters elementary school.

The Limping Child

Gait varies considerably from one to another and it is a commonplace observation that a person may be identified by the sound of his footsteps, notably the pace and the lightness or heaviness of tread, by their carriage at a distance, even before the person is recognizable by face. Obviously, the gaits of men and women differ, a woman’s steps being quicker and shorter. Sherlock Holmes expressed pride in his talent for deducing from the manner of gait, an individual’s personality and occupation. It is said that Charcot could often make the correct diagnosis, even before seeing the patient, based on the sound of patient walking down the hallway on the way to the examining room. The changes in stance and gait that accompany aging—the slightly stooped posture and slow, stiff tread as described in Chap. 28, on aging—are so familiar that they are not perceived as abnormalities.

The normal gait seldom attracts attention but it should be observed with care if slight deviations from normal are to be appreciated. The body is erect, the head is straight, and the arms hang loosely and gracefully at the sides, each moving rhythmically forward with the opposite leg. The feet are slightly externally rotated, the steps are approximately equal, and the medial malleoli almost touch as each foot passes the other. The medial edges of the heels, as they strike the ground with each step, lie almost along a straight line. As each leg moves forward, there is coordinated flexion of the hip and knee, dorsiflexion of the foot, and a barely perceptible elevation of the hip, so that the foot clears the ground. Also, with each step, the thorax advances slightly on the side opposite the swinging lower limb. The heel strikes the ground first, and inspection of the shoes will show that this part is most subject to wear.

A particular disorder of gait, also of peripheral origin and resembling steppage gait, may be observed in patients with painful dysesthesias of the soles of the feet. Because of the exquisite pain evoked by tactile stimulation of the feet, the patient treads gingerly, as though walking barefoot on hot sand or pavement, with the feet rotated in such a way as to limit contact with their most painful portions. The usual cause is one of the painful peripheral neuropathies (most often alcoholic-nutritional but also toxic and amyloid types), causalgia, or erythromelalgia.

The patient with hemiplegia or hemiparesis holds the affected leg stiffly and does not flex it freely at the hip, knee, and ankle. The leg tends to rotate outward to describe a semicircle, first away from and then toward the trunk (circumduction). The foot scrapes the floor, contact being made by the toe and outer heel of the foot. One can recognize a spastic gait by the sound of slow, rhythmic scuffing of the foot and wearing of the medial toe of the shoe. With a cerebral or cervical lesion, the arm on the affected side is weak and stiff to a variable degree; it is carried in a flexed position and does not swing naturally (Fig. 6-2A). In the hemiparetic child, the arm tends to abduct as he steps forward. This type of gait disorder is most often a sequela of stroke or trauma but may result from any condition that damages the corticospinal pathway on one side.

The spastic paraplegic or paraparetic gait is, in effect, a bilateral hemiplegic gait. Each leg is advanced slowly and stiffly, with restricted motion at the hips and knees. The legs are extended or slightly bent at the knees and the thighs may be strongly adducted, causing the legs almost to cross as the patient walks (scissor-like gait; Fig. 6-2B). The steps are regular and short and the patient advances only with great effort as though wading waist-deep in water. The defect is in stiffness of the stepping mechanism and in propulsion, not in support or equilibrium.

an alliterative phrase to describe the characteristic abnormalities of stance and gait: The patient “straddles as he stands and waddles as he walks.” The waddle is the result of bilateral weakness of the gluteus medius. Many affected boys have a tendency to walk on their toes as a consequence of contractures in the gastrocnemii muscles. Calf pain is frequent. Weakening of the muscles that fix the scapulae to the thorax (serratus anterior, lower trapezius, rhomboids) causes winging of the scapulae, and the scapular angles can sometimes be seen above the shoulders when one

sitting position, he first flexes his trunk at the hips, puts his hands on his knees, and pushes the trunk upward by working the hands up the thighs. In rising from the ground, the child first assumes a four-point position by extending the arms and legs to the fullest possible extent and then works each hand alternately up the corresponding thigh (the sign traditionally attached to Gowers’ name). In getting up from a recumbent position, the patient turns his head and trunk and pushes himself sideways to a sitting position. S.A.K. Wilson used an alliterative phrase to

Muscles of the pelvic girdle, lumbosacral spine, and shoulders become weak and wasted, accounting for certain clinical peculiarities. Weakness of abdominal and paravertebral muscles accounts for a lordotic posture and protuberant abdomen when standing and the rounded back when sitting. Weakness of the extensors of the knees and hips interferes with equilibrium and with activities such as climbing stairs or rising from a chair or from a stooped posture. In standing and walking, the patient places his feet wide apart so as to increase his base of support. To rise from a sitting position, he first

Despite these radiographic measures, the diagnosis of appendi-citis remains largely clinical, and each clinician should develop his or her own threshold to operate or to observe the patient. A reasonable practice guideline is as follows. When the diagno-sis is clinically apparent, appendectomy should obviously be performed with minimal delay. Localized right lower quadrant tenderness associated with low-grade fever and leukocytosis in boys should prompt surgical exploration. In girls, ovarian or uterine pathology must also be considered.

Failure of development of visual function is usually revealed by strabismus and by disorders of ocular movements, as described in Chap. 12. Any defect of the refractive apparatus or the acuity of the central visual pathways results in wandering, jerky movements of the eyes. The optic discs may be atrophic in such cases, but it should be pointed out that the discs in infants tend naturally to be paler than those of an older child. In congenital hypoplasia of the optic nerves, the nerve heads are extremely small. Defects in the retina and choroid are detectable by funduscopy. Faulty vision becomes increasingly apparent in older infants when the normal sequences of hand inspection and visuomanual coordination fail to emerge. Retention of pupillary light reflexes in a sightless child signifies a defect in the geniculocalcarine tracts or occipital lobes— conditions that may be confirmed by MRI and testing of visual evoked responses.

With respect to hearing, again there is the difficulty in evaluating this function in an infant. Normally, after a few weeks of life, alert parents notice that the child makes a brisk startle to loud noises and a response to other sounds. A tinkling bell brought from behind the infant usually results in hearkening or head turning and visual searching, but a lack of these responses warns only of the most severe hearing defects. The detection of slight degrees of deafness, enough to interfere with auditory learning, requires special testing. To make the problem even more difficult, both a peripheral and a central disorder may be present in some conditions, such as the now infrequent disorder of kernicterus. Brainstem auditory evoked responses are particularly helpful in confirming peripheral (cochlear and eighth nerve) abnormalities in the infant and young child. After the first few months, impaired hearing becomes more obvious and interferes with language development, as described in the following text. It is of interest that the identification and remediation of early (infants) hearing defects by screening leads to higher scores on language tests later in childhood but not improved speech, according to a study by Kennedy and colleagues.

For children not screened at birth (such as children of immigrant parents) or children with suspected acquired hearing loss, later testing may allow early appropriate intervention. Hearing can be screened by means of an office audiogram, but other techniques are needed (ABR, behavior audiology) for young, neurologically immature or impaired, and behaviorally difficult children. The typical audiologic assessment includes pure-tone audiometry over a variety of sound frequencies (pitches), especially over the range of frequencies in which most speech occurs. Pneumatic otoscopic examination and tympanometry are used to assess middle ear function and the tympanic membrane compliance for pathology in the middle ear, such as fluid, ossicular dysfunction, and eustachian tube dysfunction (see Chapter 9).

The treatment of conductive hearing loss (largely due tootitis media and middle ear effusions) is discussed in Chapter 105. Treatment of sensorineural hearing impairment may bemedical or surgical. If amplification is indicated, hearing aidscan be tuned preferentially to amplify the frequency ranges inwhich the patient has decreased acuity. Educational intervention typically includes speech-language therapy and teachingAmerican Sign Language. Even with amplification, many hear-ing-impaired children show deficits in processing auditoryinformation, requiring special educational services for helpingto read and for other academic skills. Cochlear implants are surgically implantable devices that provide hearing sensation toindividuals with severe to profound hearing loss. The implantsare designed to substitute for the function of the middle ear,cochlear mechanical motion, and sensory cells, transformingsound energy into electrical energy that initiates impulses inthe auditory nerve. Cochlear implants are indicated for children older than 12 months with profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss who have limited benefit from hearing aids,have failed to progress in auditory skill development, and haveno radiologic or medical contraindications. Implantation inchildren as young as possible gives them the most advantageous auditory environment for speech-language learning.

Hearing and Vision Screening of Older Children

Inferences about hearing are drawn from asking parents aboutresponses to sound and speech and by examining speech andlanguage development closely. Inferences about vision maybe made by examining gross motor milestones (children withvision problems may have a delay) and by physical examination of the eye. Parental concerns about vision should be sought untilthe child is 3 years of age and about hearing until the child is4 years of age. If there are concerns, definitive testing shouldbe arranged. Hearing can be screened by auditory evokedresponses, as mentioned for newborns. For toddlers and olderchildren who cannot cooperate with formal audiologic testingwith headphones, behavioral audiology may be used. Sounds ofa specific frequency or intensity are provided in a standard environment within a soundproof room, and responses are assessedby a trained audiologist. Vision may be assessed by referral to apediatric ophthalmologist and by visual evoked responses.

Children 3 Years of Age and Older

At various ages, hearing and vision should be screened objectively using standard techniques as specified in the Bright Futures’ recommendations. Asking the family and child about any concerns or consequences of poor hearing or vision accomplishes subjective evaluation. At 3 years of age, children are screened for vision for the first time if they are developmentally able to be tested. Many children at this age do not have the interactive language or interpersonal skills to perform a vision screen; these children should be re-examined at a 3to 6-month interval to ensure that their vision is normal. Because most of these children do not yet identify letters, using a Snellen eye chart with standard shapes is recommended. When a child is able to identify letters, the more accurate letter-based chart should be used. Audiologic testing of sounds with headphones should be begun on the fourth birthday (although Head Start requires that pediatricians attempt the hearing screening at 3 years of age). Any suspected audiologic problem should be evaluated by a careful history and physical examination, with referral for comprehensive testing. Children who have a documented vision problem, failed screening, or parental concern should be referred, preferably to a pediatric ophthalmologist.

Abnormalities of these cranial nerves may cause diplopia (double vision). With unilateral third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy, the involved eye deviates down and out (infraducted, abducted), with associated ptosis and a dilated, mydriatic pupil. Injury to cranial nerve IV (trochlear nerve) causes weakness of downward eye movement with consequent vertical diplopia. Cranial nerve VI (abducens nerve) palsy results in the inability to move the eye outward. Because cranial nerve VI has a long intracranial route within the sub-arachnoid space, failure of abduction of one or both eyes is a frequent, but nonspecific, sign of increased ICP.

The muscles of mastication can be observed as an infant sucks and swallows. The corneal reflex can test cranial nerves V ophthalmic division and VII at any age. Facial sensation of light touch and pain can be determined with cotton gauze and pinprick. Facial sensation can be functionally assessed in an infant by gently brushing the cheek, which will produce the rooting reflex (turns head and neck with mouthing movement, as if seeking to nurse).

Facial muscles are assessed by observing the face during rest, crying, and blinking. At older, cooperative ages, children can be asked to smile, blow out their cheeks, blink forcibly, and furrow their foreheads. Weakness of all unilateral muscles of the face, including the forehead, eye, and mouth, indicates a lesion of the ipsilateral peripheral facial nerve (Bell palsy).Because the upper third of the face receives bilateral cortical innervation, if the weakness affects only the lower face and mouth, a contralateral lesion of upper motor neuron in the brain (tumor, stroke, abscess) must be considered.

Lesions of cranial nerve VIII cause deafness, tinnitus, and vertigo. Normally, alert neonates blink in response to a bell or other abrupt, loud sound. Four-month-old infants turn their head and eyes to localize a sound. Hearing can be tested in a verbal child by whispering a word in one ear while covering the opposite ear. If there are any concerns about hearing, formal audiologic assessment is indicated.

Increased testosterone levels suggest an androgen-producing neoplasm of the ovary or the adrenal gland. Such neoplasms may be palpable on abdominal or rectal exam ination. Increased 17α-hydroxyprogesterone levels are diagnostic of 21-hydroxylase deficiency (i.e., congenital adrenal hyperplasia [CAH]). Levels of DHEAS are elevated in various forms of CAH.

If the estradiol levels are compatible with the degree of pubertal development observed, evaluation of the central nervous system by MRI or CT scanning is warranted.

Bone age should always be assessed in evaluating an individual with sexual precocity.

A GnRH stimulation test can be used to confirm central precocious puberty. After 100 μg GnRH, an LH peak of greater than 15 mIU/mL is suggestive of gonadotropin-dependent precocious puberty (68).

Perhaps the most difficult decision for the gynecologist is determining how much evaluation is warranted for the young girl brought in by her mother for precocious breast budding only (precocious thelarche) or the appearance of pubic or axillary hair alone (precocious pubarche or adrenarche) (Fig. 29.17). In such cases, it is acceptable to many clinicians to follow the patient at frequent intervals and to proceed with evaluation if there is evidence of pubertal progression. The feasibility of this approach may depend on the concerns of the parents.

A baseline plasma total testosterone level >12 nmol/L (>3.5 ng/mL) usually indicates a virilizing tumor, whereas a level >7 nmol/L (>2 ng/ mL) is suggestive. A basal DHEAS level >18.5 μmol/L (>7000 μg/L) suggests an adrenal tumor. Although DHEAS has been proposed as a “marker” of predominant adrenal androgen excess, it is not unusual to find modest elevations in DHEAS among women with PCOS. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be used to localize an adrenal mass, and transvaginal ultrasound usually suffices to identify an ovarian mass if clinical evaluation and hormonal levels suggest these possibilities.

PCOS is the most common cause of ovarian androgen excess (Chap. 412). An increased ratio of LH to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is characteristic in carefully studied patients with PCOS. However, because of the pulsatile nature of gonadotropin secretion, this finding may be absent in up to half of women with PCOS. Therefore, measurement of plasma LH and FSH is not needed to make a diagnosis of PCOS. Transvaginal ultrasound classically shows enlarged ovaries and increased stroma in women with PCOS. However, cystic ovaries also may be found in women without clinical or laboratory features of PCOS.

It has been suggested that the measurement of circulating levels of antimüllerian hormone (AMH) may help in making the diagnosis of PCOS; however, this remains controversial. AMH levels reflect ovarian reserve and correlate with follicular number. Measurement of AMH can be useful when considering premature ovarian insufficiency in a patient who presents with oligomenorrhea, in which case a subnormal level of AMH will be present.

If conception occurs, hCG produced by the trophoblast binds to LH receptors on the corpus luteum, maintaining steroid hormone production and preventing involution of the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum is essential for the hormonal maintenance of the endometrium during the first 6–10 weeks of pregnancy until this function is taken over by the placenta.

Menstrual bleeding should become regular within 2–4 years of menarche, although anovulatory and irregular cycles are common before that. For the remainder of adult reproductive life, the cycle shortening of cycle length with age such that women over the age of 2379 35 have cycles that are shorter than during their younger reproductive years. Anovulatory cycles increase as women approach menopause, and bleeding patterns may be erratic.

Women who report regular monthly bleeding with cycles that do not vary by >4 days generally have ovulatory cycles, but several other clinical signs can be used to assess the likelihood of ovulation. Some women experience mittelschmerz, described as midcycle pelvic discomfort that is thought to be caused by the rapid expansion of the dominant follicle at the time of ovulation. A constellation of premenstrual moliminal symptoms such as bloating, breast tenderness, and food cravings often occur several days before menses in ovulatory cycles, but their absence cannot be used as evidence of anovulation. Methods that can be used to determine whether ovulation is likely include a serum progesterone level >5 ng/mL ~7 days before expected menses, an increase in basal body temperature of 0.24°C (>0.5°F) in the second half of the cycle due to the thermoregulatory effect of progesterone, or the detection of the urinary LH surge using ovulation predictor kits. Because ovulation occurs ~36 h after the LH surge, urinary LH can be helpful in timing intercourse to coincide with ovulation.

(Assume that the patient is at sea level and the patient’s respiratory quotient is 0.8.) According to the alveolar air equation (

Eq. 23.13

R 44PAO2 = [0 3. × (760 − 47)] − 0 8. = 159 mm Hg

Therefore,

This high AaDO2 suggests that the patient has lung disease (in this case, pneumonia).

Abnormalities in PaO2 can occur with or without an elevation in AaDO2. Hence, the relationship between PaO2 and AaDO2 is useful in determining the cause of an abnormal PaO2 and in predicting the response to therapy (particularly to supplemental O2 administration). Causes of a reduction in PaO2 (arterial hypoxemia) and their effect on AaDO2 are listed in

Table 23.2 . Each of these causes is discussed in greater detail in the following sections.

Arterial Blood Hypoxemia, Hypoxia, and Hypercarbia

Arterial hypoxemia is defined as a PaO2 lower than 80 mm Hg in an adult who is breathing room air at sea level. Hypoxia is defined as insufficient O2 to carry out normal metabolic functions; hypoxia often occurs when the PaO2 is less than 60 mm Hg. There are four major categories of hypoxia. The first, hypoxic hypoxia, is the most common. The six main pulmonary conditions associated with hypoxic hypoxia—anatomical shunt, physiological shunt, decreased FiO2, V̇ /Q̇ mismatching, diffusion abnormalities, and hypoventilation—are described in the following sections and in

If associated conditions preclude infusion of saline, renal HCO3 loss can be accelerated by administration of acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, which is usually effective in patients with adequate renal function but can worsen K+ losses. Dilute hydrochloric acid (0.1 N HCl) is also effective but can cause hemolysis, and must be delivered slowly in a central vein.

Respiratory acidosis can be due to severe pulmonary disease, respiratory muscle fatigue, or abnormalities in ventilatory control and is recognized by an increase in Paco2 and decrease in pH (Table 66-7). In acute respiratory acidosis, there is an immediate compensatory elevation (due to cellular buffering mechanisms) in HCO3 -, which increases 1 mmol/L for every 10-mmHg increase in Paco2. In chronic respiratory acidosis (>24 h), renal adaptation increases the [HCO3 -] by 4 mmol/L for every 10-mmHg increase in Paco2. The serum HCO3 usually does not increase above 38 mmol/L.

The clinical features vary according to the severity and duration of the respiratory acidosis, the underlying disease, and whether there is accompanying hypoxemia. A rapid increase in Paco2 may cause anxiety, dyspnea, confusion, psychosis, and hallucinations and may progress to coma. Lesser degrees of dysfunction in chronic hypercapnia include sleep disturbances; loss of memory; daytime somnolence; personality changes; impairment of coordination; and motor disturbances such as tremor, myoclonic jerks, and asterixis. Headaches and other signs that mimic raised intracranial pressure, such as papilledema, abnormal reflexes, and focal muscle weakness, are due to vasoconstriction secondary to loss of the vasodilator effects of CO2.

document (2) 

Alveolar hyperventilation decreases Paco2 and increases the HCO3 -/ Paco2 ratio, thus increasing pH (Table 66-7). Nonbicarbonate cellular buffers respond by consuming HCO3 -. Hypocapnia develops when a sufficiently strong ventilatory stimulus causes CO2 output in the lungs to exceed its metabolic production by tissues. Plasma pH and [HCO3 -] appear to vary proportionately with Paco2 over a range from 40–15 mmHg. The relationship between arterial [H+] concentration and Paco2 is ∼0.7 mmol/L per mmHg (or 0.01 pH unit/mmHg), and that for plasma [HCO3 -] is 0.2 mmol/L

A mixed acid-base disorder is present when there is morethan one primary acid-base disturbance. An infant with bronchopulmonary dysplasia may have a respiratory acidosis fromchronic lung disease and a metabolic alkalosis from a diureticused to treat the chronic lung disease. Formulas are available for calculating the appropriate metabolic or respiratory compensation for the six primary simple acid-base disorders (Table 37-1). Appropriate compensation is expected in a simple disorder; it is not optional. If a patient does not have appropriatecompensation, a mixed acid-base disorder is present.

Metabolic acidosis occurs frequently in hospitalized children; diarrhea is the most common cause. For a patient with

Metabolic acidosis PCO2 = 1.5 × [HCO3–] + 8 ± 2 Metabolic alkalosis PCO2 increases by 7 mm Hg for each 10-mEq/L increase in the serum [HCO3–] Respiratory acidosis Acute [HCO3–] increases by 1 for each 10-mm Hg increase in the PCO2 Chronic [HCO3–] increases by 3.5 for each 10-mm Hg increase in the PCO2 Respiratory alkalosis Acute [HCO3–] falls by 2 for each 10-mm Hg decrease in the PCO2 Chronic [HCO3–] falls by 4 for each 10-mm Hg decrease in the PCO2 an unknown medical problem, the presence of a metabolic acidosis is often helpful diagnostically because it suggests a relatively narrow differential diagnosis (Table 37-2).

Diarrhea causes a loss of bicarbonate from the body. The amount of bicarbonate lost in the stool depends on the volume of diarrhea and the bicarbonate concentration of the stool, which tends to increase with more severe diarrhea. Diarrhea often causes volume depletion because of losses of sodium and water, potentially exacerbating the acidosis by causing hypoperfusion (shock) and a lactic acidosis. There are three forms of renal tubular acidosis (RTA):

is 0.2 mmol/L per mmHg. Hypocapnia sustained for >2–6 h is further compensated by a decrease in renal ammonium and titratable acid excretion and a reduction in filtered HCO3 reabsorption. Full renal adaptation to respiratory alkalosis may take several days and requires normal volume status and renal function. The kidneys appear to respond directly to the lowered Paco2 rather than to alkalosis per se. In chronic respiratory alkalosis a 1-mmHg decrease in Paco2 causes a 0.4-to 0.5-mmol/L drop in [HCO3 -] and a 0.3-mmol/L decrease (or 0.003 increase in

Anxiety disorder is a chronic state, some would say a disease, punctuated by recurrent attacks of acute anxiety or panic. The acute attacks are the hallmark of the disease and some psychiatrists are reluctant to make a diagnosis of anxiety neurosis in their absence. Because of the clinical features of panic attacks and particularly their episodic nature, simulating an acute medical condition, they are of special interest to neurologists and general physicians. While anxiety may be inferred from observing the activities of young children, and is reported as a form of nervousness by older children and adolescents, more often there are physical complaints at times of transition or stress during the day or year.

Panic attacks in their full form are prone to begin after this age and are almost as dramatic as seizures. They often begin with distressing feelings of dread and foreboding. The patient is assailed by a sense of strangeness, as though his body had changed or the surroundings were unreal. He is frightened, sometimes by the prospect of imminent death (angor animi) or of losing his mind or self-control. There may be a feeling of smothering. “I am dying” or “I can’t breathe” are characteristic expressions of alarm and panic. The heart races, breathing comes in rapid gasps, the pupils may be dilated, and the patient may sweat or tremble. The palpitation and breathing difficulties are so prominent that a cardiologist is often consulted. Some of our psychiatric colleagues identify breathlessness or a suffocating feeling as central to the diagnosis of panic (and attribute psychologic meaning to the symptom), but this is not sustained in our observations of affected patients. The symptoms abate spontaneously after 15 to 30 min, leaving the patient shaken, tense, perplexed, and often embarrassed. There is no confusion, and after the episode there is full memory of the event.

4. In a chronic delusional-hallucinatory state in a chronic alcoholic patient (chronic alcoholic hallucinosis) it will usually be disclosed that the illness began when alcohol was withdrawn, after a period of sustained drinking, and at first took the form of an acute auditory hallucinosis characterized by threatening, exteriorized auditory hallucinations to which the patient’s emotional reaction was appropriate. Only later do a few of these patients drift into a quiet hallucinatory, mildly paranoid state, with rather bland affect. Evidence of the prepsychotic schizoid personality cannot be detected and there is usually no family history of schizophrenia. Cases of this type with which we are familiar had their onset between 45 and 50 years of age, that is, much later than the usual age of onset of schizophrenia.

5. A patient who is confused or stuporous and seemingly catatonic-negativistic, refusing or unable to speak, to execute commands, or to be activated in any way. If signs of focal cerebral or brainstem disease are absent, one is tempted to make a diagnosis of catatonic schizophrenia, not appreciating that catatonia as a phenomenon may be indistinguishable from akinetic mutism (see Chap. 15). It may also appear with widespread disease of the associational cortices and as mentioned earlier, with severe depression, certain confusional states, and hysteria. The authors have seen cases of hypoxic and other metabolic encephalopathies, Schilder disease, certain storage diseases, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease mistaken for schizophrenia because of failure to adhere to this principle.

6. A patient with temporal lobe epilepsy who, apart from intermittent psychomotor seizures, has long periods (weeks or months) of hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior, and disorganization of thinking. Such a mental disturbance reflects the presence of a persistent state of temporal lobe seizures (temporal lobe status epilepticus), which in some cases has been demonstrated by depth electrodes to originate in the amygdaloid or other medial temporal areas. The nature of the disturbances of emotionality and mentation in such patients, a somewhat controversial subject, is discussed in Chaps. 15 and 24.

The term dizziness is applied by the patient to a number of different sensory and psychic experiences—a feeling of rotation or whirling as well as nonrotatory swaying, weakness, faintness, light-headedness, or unsteadiness. Blurring of vision, feelings of unreality, syncope, and even petit mal or other seizure phenomena may be called “dizzy spells.” These experiences fall into four categories: (1) vertigo, a physical sensation of motion of self or the environment; (2) near syncope, a sensation of faintness; (3) disequilibrium, a disorder of imbalance of stance or gait; and (4) ill-defined light-headedness, or “giddiness,” a symptom that often accompanies anxiety. Hence, close questioning of the patient as to how he is using the term dizziness is a necessary first step in clinical work.

Several mechanisms are responsible for the maintenance of a balanced posture and for awareness of the position of the body in relation to its surroundings and to gravity. Continuous afferent impulses from the eyes, labyrinths, muscles, and joints inform us of the position of different parts of the body. In response to these impulses, the adaptive movements necessary to maintain equilibrium are carried out. Normally, we are unaware of these adjustments because they operate largely at a reflex level. The most important of the afferent impulses are the following.

Visual information from the retinae and possibly proprioceptive impulses from the ocular muscles, enable us to judge the distance of objects from the body. This information is coordinated with sensory information from the labyrinths and neck (see the following text) to stabilize gaze during movements of the head and body.

patients, justifying the term depressive psychosis. The delusions are generally congruent with the patient’s mood and are not as fixed or bizarre as those of schizophrenia or paranoia. In our experience, delusions are more common in older patients and tend to appear only after weeks or months of more typical symptoms of depression. Common ones in experience with our patients have been gas poisoning in the house, unaccustomed suspiciousness, alleged home break ins, having inadequate money, or being stolen from or cheated. (Some of these arise in early dementia as well.) Hallucinations, when they occur, are

The depressed patient tends to move slowly, sighing is frequent, and speech is reduced. The mental life of such an individual may narrow to a single-minded concern about physical or mental health. In dialogue, the patient’s responses become so stereotyped that the listener can soon predict exactly what is going to be said. There is a poverty of ideation and sometimes a notable absence of insight. Consciousness is clear, and although there is no evidence of a schizophrenic type of thought disorder, delusional ideas, and less often hallucinations, may be prominent in some patients, justifying the term

Bowel sounds are hypoactive and are substantially decreased with peritonitis related to a ruptured diverticular abscess. Abdominal examination reveals distention with left lower quadrant tenderness on direct palpation and localized rebound tenderness. Abdominal and bimanual rectovaginal examinations may reveal a poorly mobile, doughy inﬂammatory mass in the left lower quadrant. Leukocytosis and fever are common. Stool guaiac may be positive as a result of inﬂammation of the colon or microperforation.

CT with and without contrast is an important adjunct to history and physical examination (30). It will reveal a swollen, edematous bowel and can rule out an abscess. A barium enema is contraindicated. Diverticulitis is initially managed medically with intravenous administration of ﬂuids, strict restriction of oral intake, and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. A diverticular abscess, obstruction, fistula, or perforation requires general surgical intervention.

Intestinal Obstruction The most common causes of intestinal obstruction in women are postsurgical adhesions, hernia formation, inﬂammatory bowel disease, or carcinoma of the bowel or ovary.

Intestinal obstruction is heralded by the onset of colicky abdominal pain followed by abdominal distention, vomiting, constipation, and obstipation. Higher and more acute obstruction results in early vomiting. Colonic obstruction presents with a greater degree of abdominal distention and obstipation. Vomiting first consists of gastric contents, followed by bile, then material with feculent odor, depending on the level of obstruction.

Fever is often present in the late stages. At the onset of mechanical obstruction, bowel sounds are high pitched and maximal during an episode of colicky pain. As the obstruction progresses, bowel sounds decrease and, when absent, suggest ischemic bowel. Marked abdominal distention often ensues.

document (1) 

For partial obstruction, supportive care may be sufficient and should include NPO status, NG suction, IV hydration, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and Foley catheterization to monitor ﬂ uid status.

Surgery is required in cases of complete SBO, vascular compromise (necrotic bowel), or symptoms lasting > 3 days without resolution.

Exploratory laparotomy may be performed with lysis of adhesions, resection of necrotic bowel, and evaluation for stricture, IBD, and hernias.

There is a 2% mortality risk for a nonstrangulated SBO; strangulated SBO is associated with up to a 25% mortality rate depending on the time between diagnosis and treatment.

A second-look laparotomy or laparoscopy may be performed 18–36 hours after initial surgical treatment to reevaluate bowel viability if ischemia is a concern.

Loss of peristalsis without structural obstruction. Risk factors include recent surgery/GI procedures, severe medical illness, immobility, hypokalemia or other electrolyte imbalances, hypothyroidism, DM, and medications that slow GI motility (e.g., anticholinergics, opioids).

Presenting symptoms include diffuse, constant, moderate abdominal discomfort; nausea and vomiting (especially with eating); and an absence of fatulence or bowel movements.

The cardinal signs are colicky abdominal pain, abdominal distention, emesis, and obstipation. More intraluminal fluid accumulates in patients with distal obstruction, which typically leads to greater distention, more discomfort, and delayed emesis. This emesis is feculent when there is bacterial overgrowth. Patients with more proximal obstruction commonly present with less abdominal distention but more pronounced vomiting. Elements of the history that might be helpful include any prior history of surgery, including herniorrhaphy, as well as any history of cancer or inflammatory bowel disease.

Most patients, even with simple obstruction, appear to be critically ill. Many may be oliguric, hypotensive, and tachycardic because of severe intravascular volume depletion. Fever is worrisome for strangulation or systemic inflammatory changes. Bowel sounds and bowel functional activity are notoriously difficult to interpret. Classically, many patients with early small-bowel obstruction will have high-pitched, “musical” tinkling bowel sounds and peristaltic “rushes” known as borborygmi. Later in the course of disease, the bowel sounds may be absent or hypoactive as peristaltic activity decreases. This is in contrast to the common findings in patients with ileus or pseudo-obstruction where bowel sounds are typically absent or hypoactive from the beginning. Lastly, patients with partial blockage may continue to pass flatus and stool, and those with complete blockage may evacuate bowel contents present downstream beyond their obstruction.

All surgical incisions should be examined. The presence of a tender abdominal or groin mass strongly suggests that an incarcerated hernia may be the cause of obstruction. The presence of tenderness

document (3) 

Collapsed bowel distal to obstruction should increase the concern about the presence of complications such as ischemia, necrosis, or peritonitis. Severe pain with localization or signs of peritoneal irritation is suspicious for strangulated or closed-loop obstruction. It is important to remember that the discomfort may be out of proportion to physical findings mimicking the complaints of patients with acute mesenteric ischemia. Every patient should have a rectal examination. Patients with colonic volvulus present with the classic manifestations of closed-loop obstruction: severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and obstipation. Asymmetrical abdominal distension and a tympanic mass may be evident.

Patients with ileus or pseudo-obstruction may have signs and symptoms similar to those of bowel obstruction. Although abdominal distention is present, colicky abdominal pain is typically absent, and patients may not have nausea or emesis. Ongoing, regular discharge of stool or flatus can sometimes help distinguish patients with ileus from those with complete mechanical bowel obstruction.

Laboratory testing should include a complete blood count and serum electrolyte and creatinine measurements. Serial assessments are often useful. Mild hemoconcentration and slight elevation of the white blood cell count commonly occur after simple bowel obstruction. Emesis and dehydration may cause hypokalemia, hypochloremia, elevated blood urea nitrogen–to–creatinine ratios, and metabolic alkalosis. Patients may be hyponatremic on admission because many have attempted to rehydrate themselves with hypotonic fluids. The presence of guaiac-positive stools and iron-deficiency anemia are strongly suggestive of malignancy.

During endarterectomy, plaque is removed and the vessel reopened. In many instances a patch of material is sewn over the hole in the vessel, enabling improved flow and preventing narrowing from the suturing of the vessel.

In the clinic

Cerebral aneurysms arise from the vessels in and around the cerebral arterial circle (of Willis). They typically occur in and around the anterior communicating artery, the posterior communicating artery, the branches of the middle cerebral artery, the distal end of the basilar artery (Fig. 8.41), and the posterior inferior cerebellar artery.

As the aneurysms enlarge, they have a significant risk of rupture. Typically patients have no idea that there is anything wrong. As the aneurysm ruptures, the patient complains of a sudden-onset “thunderclap” headache that produces neck stiffness and may induce vomiting. In a number of patients death ensues, but many patients reach the hospital, where the diagnosis is established. An initial CT scan demonstrates blood within the subarachnoid space, and this may be associated with an intracerebral bleed. Further management usually includes cerebral angiography, which enables the radiologist to determine the site, size, and origin of the aneurysm.

Usually patients undergo complex surgery to ligate the neck of the aneurysm. More recently radiological intervention has superseded the management of some aneurysms in specific sites. This treatment involves cannulation of the femoral artery, and placement of a long catheter through the aorta into the carotid circulation and thence into the cerebral circulation. The tip of the catheter is placed within the aneurysm and is packed with fine microcoils (Fig. 8.42), which seals the rupture.

Bleeding or seizures are the main modes of presentation. Most AVMs are clinically silent for a long time. Although the lesion is present from birth, onset of symptoms is most common between 10 and 30 years of age; occasionally it is delayed to age 50 or even beyond. In almost half of patients, the first clinical manifestation is a cerebral subarachnoid hemorrhage; in 30 percent, a seizure is the first and only manifestation; and in 20 percent, the only symptom is headache. Progressive hemiparesis or other focal neurologic deficit is present in approximately 10 percent of patients. The first hemorrhage may be fatal, but in more than 90 percent of cases the bleeding stops and the patient survives. Most often there are no symptoms before rupture. Chronic, recurrent headache may be a complaint; usually it is of a nondescript type but a classic migraine with or without neurologic accompaniment occurs in approximately 10 percent of patients—probably with greater frequency than it does in the general population. Most of the malformations associated with migraine-like headaches lie in the parietooccipital region of one cerebral hemisphere, and about two-thirds of such patients have a family history of migraine.

Huge AVMs may produce a slowly progressive neurologic deficit because of compression of neighboring structures by the enlarging mass of vessels and by shunting of blood through greatly dilated vascular channels. It has also been proposed that an “intracerebral steal” can result in hypoperfusion of the surrounding brain (Homan et al). When the vein of Galen is enlarged as a result of drainage from an adjacent AVM, hydrocephalus may result, particularly in children. With moderate size and large lesions, one or both carotid arteries frequently pulsate unusually forcefully in the neck. A systolic bruit heard over the carotid in the neck or over the mastoid process or the eyeballs in a young adult is suggestive of an AVM. However, such bruits have been heard in fewer than 25 percent of our patients. Exercise such as repeated squatting that increases the pulse pressure may bring out a bruit if none is present at rest. There is no relation of the existence of an AVM, or its rupture, to chronic hypertension (the same pertains to cerebral aneurysms).

With rupture of the aneurysm, blood under high pressure is forced into the subarachnoid space and the resulting clinical events assume one of three patterns: (1) the patient is stricken with an excruciating generalized headache and vomiting and falls unconscious almost immediately; (2) severe generalized headache develops in the same instantaneous manner but the patient remains relatively lucid with varying degrees of stiff neck—the most common syndrome; (3) rarely, consciousness is lost so quickly that there is no preceding complaint. If the hemorrhage is massive, death may ensue in a matter of minutes or hours, so that ruptured aneurysm must be considered in the differential diagnosis of sudden death. A considerable proportion of such patients probably never reach a hospital. Decerebrate rigidity and brief clonic jerking of the limbs may occur at the onset of the hemorrhage, always in association with unconsciousness. Persistent deep coma is accompanied by irregular respirations, attacks of extensor rigidity, and finally respiratory arrest and circulatory collapse. In these rapidly evolving cases, the subarachnoid blood has greatly increased the intracranial pressure to a level that approaches arterial pressure and caused a marked reduction in cerebral perfusion. In some instances, the hemorrhage has dissected intracerebrally and entered the brain or ventricular system.

Rupture of the aneurysm usually occurs while the patient is active rather than during sleep, and in a few instances, during sexual intercourse, straining at stool, lifting heavy objects, or other sustained exertion (see “Headaches Related to Sexual Activity” in Chap. 9). A momentary Valsalva maneuver, as in coughing or sneezing, has generally not caused aneurysmal rupture (it may cause arterial dissection). In patients who survive the initial rupture, the most feared complication is rerupture, an event that may occur at any time from minutes up to 2 or 3 weeks.

Procedure. The first successful operation for atrial fibrillation, the Cox-Maze procedure, was introduced clinically in 1987 by James Cox. The procedure involved the completion of a maze-like pattern of surgical incisions across both the right and left atrial that were designed to interrupt the multiple macroreentrant circuits thought to be responsible for AF, while still allowing propagation of the sinus impulse, restoring atrioventricular synchrony, and preserving atrial trans-port function. While effective at eliminating AF and reducing the risk of thromboembolism, it was not widely performed because it was technically difficult and significantly prolonged time on

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia observed clinically. Its prevalence increases from approximately 0.5% in individuals younger than 65 years of age to 10% in indi-viduals older than 80. Diagnosis is usually straightforward by means of an ECG. The ECG may also enable the identification of a prior myocardial infarction, left ventricular hypertrophy, and ven-tricular pre-excitation. Hyperthyroidism is an important treatable cause of atrial fibrillation, and a thyroid panel should be obtained at the time of diagnosis to exclude this possibility.

perfusion. The typical case is a patient with a penetrating thoracic injury who is hemody-namically stable but experiences sudden cardiac arrest after being intubated and placed on positive pressure ventilation. The patient should be placed immediately in Trendelenburg’s posi-tion to trap the air in the apex of the left ventricle. Emergency thoracotomy is followed by cross-clamping of the pulmonary hilum on the side of the injury to prevent further introduction of air (Fig. 7-14). Air is aspirated from the apex of the left ventricle and then the aortic root with an 18-gauge needle

Traumatic Pneumothorax Traumatic pneumothoraxes can result from both penetrating and nonpenetrating chest trauma. Traumatic pneumothoraxes should be treated with tube thoracostomy unless they are very small. If a hemopneumothorax is present, one chest tube should be placed in the superior part of the hemithorax to evacuate the air and another should be placed in the inferior part of the hemithorax to remove the blood. Iatrogenic pneumothorax is a type of traumatic pneumothorax that is becoming more common. The leading causes are transthoracic needle aspiration, thoracentesis, and the insertion of central intravenous catheters. Most can be managed with supplemental oxygen or aspiration, but if these measures are unsuccessful, a tube thoracostomy should be performed.

Tension Pneumothorax This condition usually occurs during mechanical ventilation or resuscitative efforts. The positive pleural pressure is life-threatening both because ventilation is severely compromised and because the positive pressure is transmitted to the mediastinum, resulting in decreased venous return to the heart and reduced cardiac output.

Difficulty in ventilation during resuscitation or high peak inspiratory pressures during mechanical ventilation strongly suggest the diagnosis. The diagnosis is made by physical examination showing an enlarged hemithorax with no breath sounds, hyperresonance to percussion, and shift of the mediastinum to the contralateral side. Tension pneumothorax must be treated as a medical emergency. If the tension in the pleural space is not relieved, the patient is likely to die from inadequate cardiac output or marked hypoxemia. A large-bore needle should be inserted into the pleural space through the second anterior intercostal space. If large amounts of gas escape from the needle after insertion, the diagnosis is confirmed. The needle should be left in place until a thoracostomy tube can be inserted.

The distal lumen of the catheter, which is beyond the balloon, measures left atrial pressure (LAP) and, in the absence of mitral valvular disease, LAP approximates LVEDP. Pulmonary–capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) equals the LAP, which equals LVEDP and is normal at 8 to 12 mm Hg. Because the standard pulmonary artery catheter has an incorporated thermistor, thermodilution studies can be performed to determine cardiac output. This thermodilution method is performed by injecting cold 5% dextrose in water through the proximal port of the catheter, which cools the blood entering the right atrium. The change in temperature measured at the more distal thermistor (4 cm from the catheter tip) generates a curve proportional to cardiac output. Knowledge of the cardiac output is helpful in establishing cardiovascular diagnoses. For example, a patient with hypotension, low-to-normal wedge pressure, and a cardiac output of 3 L per minute is most likely hypovolemic. The same patient with a cardiac output of 8 L per minute is probably septic with resultant low systemic vascular resistance.

Pulmonary artery catheters are associated with a small but significant complication rate. The complications can be grouped into those occurring during venous cannulation or insertion, during maintenance and use, and those related to interpretation of hemodynamic data (210). The most common problems encountered during venous access are cannulation of the carotid or subclavian artery and introduction of a pneumothorax. Problems resulting from the catheter itself include dysrhythmias, sepsis, and disruption of the pulmonary artery. Pulmonary artery catheters (PAC) should be placed under the supervision of experienced personnel in a setting in which complications can be rapidly diagnosed and treated. Accessory equipment such as resuscitation equipment and an external pacing device must be immediately available. Ultrasound and ﬂuoroscopic equipment if available may aid in PAC placement (211).

HIV is transmitted primarily by sexual contact (both heterosexual and male to male); by blood and blood products; and by infected mothers to infants intrapartum, perinatally, or via breast milk. After more than 30 years of experience and observations regarding other potential modalities of transmission, there is no evidence that HIV is transmitted by casual contact or that the virus can be spread by insects, such as by a mosquito bite. Table 226-3 lists the estimated risk of HIV transmission for various types of exposures.

HIV infection is predominantly a sexually transmitted infection (STI) worldwide. By far the most common mode of infection, particularly in developing countries, is heterosexual transmission, although in many western countries a resurgence of male-to-male sexual transmission has occurred. Although a wide variety of factors including viral load and the presence of ulcerative genital diseases influence the efficiency of heterosexual transmission of HIV, such transmission is generally inefficient. A recent systemic review found a low per-act risk of heterosexual transmission in the absence of antiretrovirals: 0.04% for female-to-male transmission and 0.08% for male-to-female transmission during vaginal intercourse in the absence of antiretroviral therapy or condom use (Table 226-3).

HIV has been demonstrated in seminal fluid both within infected mononuclear cells and in cell-free material. The virus appears to concentrate in the seminal fluid, particularly in situations where there are increased numbers of lymphocytes and monocytes in the fluid,

he incubation period from exposure to clinical disease averages 3 to 6 weeks. Acute HIV infection is similar to many other viral syndromes and usually lasts less than 10 days. Common symptoms, if any, include fever, fatigue, rash, headache, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, myalgias, nausea, and diarrhea. After symptoms abate, the level of viremia usually decreases to a set point, and patients with the highest viral burden at this time progress more rapidly to AIDS and death (Fauci, 2007). According to the CDC, AIDS is defined by a CD4 T-cell count <200 cells/lLL, by CD4 T-cells comprising < 14 percent of alirlymphocytes, or one of several AIDS-defining illnesses (Schneider, 2008; Selik, 2014). Route of infection, the pathogenicity of the infecting viral strain, the initial viral inoculum, and the immunological status of the host all afect the rapidity of progression.

he CDC (2006b) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2016e) recommend prenatal HIV screening using an opt-out approach. his means that a woman is notiied that HIV testing is included in a comprehensive set of antenatal tests, but that testing may be declined. Women are given information regarding HIV but are not required to sign a specific consent. hrough the use of such opt-out strategies, HIV testing rates have increased. Specific state laws concerning screening vary and can be found at: ww.cdc.gov/hiv/policies/ law / states/ testing.h tml.

Repeat testing during the third trimester, preferably before 36 weeks' gestation, is considered for all pregnant women. Retesting is recommended for those at risk for acquiring HIV or for women in high-risk areas, namely, those with rates of HIV infection of 1 per 1000 pregnant women screened (Workowski, 2015). At-risk factors include injection drug use, prostitution, a suspected or known HIV-infected sexual partner, multiple sexual partners, or a diagnosis of another STD (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 20 16e).

Gonorrhea predominantly affects young, nonwhite, unmarried, less educated members of urban populations. The number of reported cases probably represents half of the true number of cases—a discrepancy resulting from underreporting, self-treatment, and nonspecific treatment without a laboratory-proven diagnosis. The number of reported new cases of gonorrhea in the United States rose from ~250,000 in the early 1960s to a high of 1.01 million in 1978. The recorded incidence of gonorrhea in modern times peaked in 1975, with 468 reported new cases per 100,000 population in the United States. This peak was attributable to the interaction of several variables, including improved accuracy of diagnosis, changes in patterns of contraceptive use, and changes in sexual behavior. The incidence of the disease has since declined gradually and is currently estimated at 120 cases per 100,000, a figure that is still the highest among industrialized countries. A fur-1003 ther decline in the overall incidence of gonorrhea in the United States over the past quarter-century may reflect increased condom use resulting from public health efforts to curtail HIV transmission. At present, the attack rate in the United States is highest among 15to 19-year-old women and 20to 24-year-old men; 60% of all reported cases occur in the preceding two groups together. From the standpoint of ethnicity, rates are highest among African Americans and lowest among persons of Asian or Pacific Island descent.

The incidence of gonorrhea is higher in developing countries than in industrialized nations. The exact incidence of any STI is difficult to ascertain in developing countries because of limited surveillance and variable diagnostic criteria. Studies in Africa have clearly demonstrated that nonulcerative STIs such as gonorrhea (in addition to ulcerative STIs) are an independent risk factor for the transmission of HIV (Chap. 226).

Gonorrhea is transmitted from males to females more efficiently than in the opposite direction. The rate of transmission to a woman during a single unprotected sexual encounter with an infected man is ~50–70%. Oropharyngeal gonorrhea occurs in ~20% of women who practice fellatio with infected partners. Transmission in either direction by cunnilingus is rare.

The burden of HPV-related cancers is expected to increase in

HIV-infected patients, given the prolonged life expectancies made possible by ART. For women living in developing countries where cervical cancer screening is not widely available, this situation may have significant consequences. Thus, elucidating the interactions of HIV infection and cervical cancer with cofactors such as diet, other sexually transmitted infections, and environmental exposures is a research focus with potentially enormous implications for women living in lowand middle-income countries.

Similar to that of cervical cancer, the incidence of anal cancer is strongly influenced by HIV infection. HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) and HIV-infected women have much higher rates of anal cancer than HIV-uninfected populations. Specifically, the incidence has been found to be as high as 130 cases/100,000 among HIV-positive MSM as opposed to only 5 cases/100,000 among HIV-negative MSM. The advent of ART has not impacted the incidence of anal cancer and high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia in the HIV-infected population.

More information on screening, prevention, and treatment in the HIV-infected population can be found at the Department of Health and Human Services website (aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines).

Occurs when the iris dilates and pushes against the lens of the eye, disrupting ﬂow of aqueous humor into the anterior chamber. Pressure in the posterior chamber then pushes the peripheral iris forward and blocks the angle.

Risk factors include family history, older age, Asian ethnicity, hyperopia, prolonged pupillary dilation (prolonged time in a dark area, stress, medications), anterior uveitis, and lens dislocation.

Hx/PE: Classically presents with extreme eye pain, blurred vision, headache, nausea, and vomiting. A hard, red eye is seen (from acute closure of a narrow anterior chamber angle); the pupil is dilated and nonreactive to light. IOP is ↑. If it resolves spontaneously prior to presentation (e.g., with pupillary constriction in sunlight), ophthalmologic examination may reveal narrow angles in one or both eyes.

Dx: Diagnosis is based on clinical history and examination. Those that resolve may mimic a migraine headache with blurred vision; the distinction is that the headaches and blurred vision are more likely to be triggered by darkness (due to pupillary dilation) rather than by bright lights (migraine).

within the cerebral hemisphere rather than a compressive lesion on its surface. Hemiparesis from subdural hematoma may sometimes be ipsilateral to the clot, the result of compression of the contralateral cerebral peduncle against the free edge of the tentorium (Kernohan-Woltman sign; see “Pathoanatomy of Brain Displacement and Herniations” in Chap. 16). If the condition progresses, the patient becomes stuporous or comatose. But this course is often interrupted by striking fluctuations of awareness.

The extravasated blood undergoes a predictable series of changes. At first fluid, the collection becomes a clot within hours. Before the clot forms, red cells settle in the dependent part of the hematoma and form a meniscus with the plasma above; this is particularly prone to occur in cases of anticoagulant-induced hemorrhage. The resultant fluid–fluid level can be observed on CT and MRI (“hematocrit effect”). Hematomas, when examined in autopsy material, contain only masses of red blood cells and proteins; rarely one sees a few remnants of destroyed brain tissue. The hematoma is often

one of several mechanisms discussed further on is believed to cause the progression of symptoms. As with acute subdural hematoma, the disturbances of mentation and consciousness (drowsiness, inattentiveness, and confusion) are more prominent than focal or lateralizing signs, and they may fluctuate. Focal signs, when present, consist of mild hemiparesis and, rarely, an aphasic disturbance. Homonymous hemianopia is seldom observed, probably because the geniculocalcarine pathway is deep and not easily compressed; similarly, hemiplegia, that is, complete paralysis of one arm and leg, is usually indicative of a lesion within the cerebral hemisphere

In chronic subdural hematoma, the traumatic etiology is often less clear. The head injury, especially in elderly persons and in those taking anticoagulant drugs, may have been trivial and forgotten. A period of weeks then follows when headaches (not invariable), light-headedness, slowness in thinking, apathy and drowsiness, unsteady gait, and occasionally a seizure are the main symptoms.

The hematoma is often surrounded by petechial hemorrhages from torn arterioles and venules. Within a few days, hemoglobin products, mainly hemosiderin and hematoidin, begin to appear. The hemosiderin forms within histiocytes that have phagocytized red blood cells (RBCs) and takes the form of ferritin granules that stain positively for iron. As oxyhemoglobin is liberated from the RBCs and becomes deoxygenated, methemoglobin appears. This begins within a few days and imparts a brownish hue to the periphery of the clot. Phagocytosis of red cells begins within 24 h, and hemosiderin

IBS is a disorder that affects all ages, although most patients have their first symptoms before age 45. Older individuals have a lower reporting frequency. Women are diagnosed with IBS two to three times as often as men and make up 80% of the population with severe IBS. As indicated in Table 352-1, pain or abdominal discomfort is a key symptom for the diagnosis of IBS. These symptoms should be improved with defecation and/or have their onset associated with a change in frequency or form of stool. Painless diarrhea or constipation does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria to be classified as IBS. Supportive symptoms that are not part of the diagnostic criteria include defecation straining, urgency or a feeling of incomplete bowel movement, passing mucus, and bloating.

Abdominal Pain According to the current IBS diagnostic criteria, abdominal pain or discomfort is a prerequisite clinical feature of IBS. Abdominal pain in IBS is highly variable in intensity and location. It is frequently episodic and crampy, but it may be superimposed on a background of constant ache. Pain may be mild enough to be ignored or it may interfere with daily activities. Despite this, malnutrition due to inadequate caloric intake is exceedingly rare with IBS. Sleep deprivation is also unusual because abdominal pain is almost uniformly present only during waking hours. However, patients with severe IBS frequently wake repeatedly during the night; thus, nocturnal pain is a poor discriminating factor between organic and functional bowel disease. Pain is often exacerbated by eating or emotional stress and improved by passage of flatus or stools. In addition, female patients with IBS commonly report worsening symptoms during the premenstrual and menstrual phases.

The pain of herniated intervertebral disc varies in severity from a mild aching discomfort to severe knife-like stabs that radiate the length of the leg and are superimposed on a constant intense ache. Sciatic pain is perceived by the patient as originating deep in the buttock and radiating to the posterolateral thigh; it may progress to the calf and ankle—to the medial malleolus (L4), lateral malleolus (L5), or heel (S1). Distal radiation to the foot is infrequent and should raise concern of an alternative process. Abortive forms of sciatica may produce aching discomfort only in the lower buttock or proximal thigh and occasionally only in the lower hamstring or upper calf. With the most severe pain, the patient is forced to stay in bed, avoiding the slightest movement; a cough, sneeze, or strain is intolerable. The most comfortable position is lying on the back with legs flexed at the knees and hips and the shoulders raised on pillows to obliterate the lumbar lordosis. For some patients, a lateral decubitus position is more comfortable. Free fragments of disc that find their way to a lateral and posterior position in the spinal canal may produce the opposite situation, one whereby the patient is unable to extend the spine and lie supine. Sitting and standing up from a sitting position are particularly painful. It is surprising to patients that a lumbar disc protrusion may cause little or no back pain. As a corollary, the presence of lumbar disc disease, even frank rupture, bears an inconsistent relationship to low back pain, as already emphasized.

In cases of root compression, pain is also characteristically provoked by pressure along the course of the sciatic nerve at the classic points of Valleix (sciatic notch, retrotrochanteric gutter, posterior surface of thigh, and head of fibula). Pressure at one point may cause radiation of pain and tingling down the leg.

A 50-year-old woman was admitted to hospital for surgical resection of the uterus (hysterectomy) for cancer. The surgeon was also going to remove all the pelvic lymph nodes and carry out a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of uterine tubes and ovaries). The patient was prepared for this procedure and underwent routine surgery. Twenty-five hours after surgery, it was noted that the patient had passed no urine and her abdomen was expanding. An ultrasound scan demonstrated a considerable amount of fluid within the abdomen. Fluid withdrawn from the abdomen was tested and found to be urine.

It was postulated that this patient’s ureters had been damaged during the surgery.

The pelvic part of the ureter courses posteroinferiorly and external to the parietal peritoneum on the lateral wall of the pelvis anterior to the internal iliac artery. It continues in its course to a point approximately 2 cm superior to the ischial spine and then passes anteromedially and superior to the levator ani muscles. Importantly, the ureter closely adheres to the peritoneum. The only structure that passes between the ureter and the peritoneum in men is the ductus deferens. In women, however, as the ureter descends on the pelvic wall, it passes under the uterine artery. The ureter continues close to the lateral fornix of the vagina, especially on the left, and enters the posterosuperior angle of the bladder.

It was at this point that the ureter was inadvertently damaged.

Knowing the anatomy and recognizing the possibility of ureteric damage enabled the surgeons to reestablish continuity of the ureter surgically. The patient was hospitalized a few days longer than expected and made an uneventful recovery.

A 25-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with a complaint of pain in her right iliac fossa. The pain had developed rapidly over approximately 40 minutes and was associated with cramps and vomiting. The surgical intern made an initial diagnosis of appendicitis.

A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 36-hour history of lower abdominal pain that was sharp and initially intermittent, later becoming constant and severe. The patient also reported feeling nauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have diarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours before admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative.

On physical examination there was tenderness in the right iliac fossa with guarding. On vaginal examination a tender mass in the right adnexal region was felt. The patient subsequently underwent a transvaginal ultrasound examination for evaluation of adnexal pathology. The scan showed a markedly enlarged right ovary measuring up to 8 cm in long axis with echogenic stroma and peripherally distributed follicles. There was no internal vascularity when color Doppler was applied. A small amount of free fluid was seen in the pouch of Douglas. The diagnosis of ovarian torsion was made.

Ovarian torsion is the twisting of an ovary on its suspensory ligament, which contains arterial, venous, and lymphatic vessels (forming so-called vascular pedicle), leading to a compromised blood supply. Initially, the venous and lymphatic circulation is compromised, resulting in ovarian edema and enlargement. The arterial flow is maintained longer due to thicker and less compressible arterial walls. Prolonged torsion leads to increased internal ovarian pressure that eventually results in arterial thrombosis, ischemia of the ovarian tissue, and necrosis. If the correct diagnosis and treatment are delayed, the patient may develop generalized sepsis.

The symptoms are nonspecific, making the diagnosis of ovarian torsion challenging. There is often no significant past medical history.

A 52-year-old woman visited her family physician with complaints of increasing lethargy and vomiting. The physician examined her and noted that compared to previous visits she had lost significant weight. She was also jaundiced, and on examination of the abdomen a well-defined 10-cm rounded mass was palpable below the liver edge in the right upper quadrant (Fig. 4.185).

The clinical diagnosis was carcinoma of the head of the pancreas.

It is difficult to appreciate how such a precise diagnosis can be made clinically when only three clinical signs have been described.

The patient’s obstruction was in the distal bile duct.

When a patient has jaundice, the causes are excessive breakdown of red blood cells (prehepatic), hepatic failure (hepatic jaundice), and posthepatic causes, which include obstruction along the length of the biliary tree.

The patient had a mass in her right upper quadrant that was palpable below the liver; this was the gallbladder.

In healthy individuals, the gallbladder is not palpable. An expanded gallbladder indicates obstruction either within the cystic duct or below the level of the cystic duct insertion (i.e., the bile duct).

The patient’s vomiting was related to the position of the tumor.

It is not uncommon for vomiting and weight loss (cachexia) to occur in patients with a malignant disease. The head of the pancreas lies within the curve of the duodenum, primarily adjacent to the descending part of the duodenum. Any tumor mass in the region of the head of the pancreas is likely to expand and may encase and invade the duodenum. Unfortunately, in this patient’s case, this happened, producing almost complete obstruction. Further discussion with the patient revealed that she was vomiting relatively undigested food soon after each meal.

A CT scan demonstrated further complications.

document (3) 

The pain is referred.

The visceral afferent (sensory) nerve fibers from the ureter pass into the spinal cord, entering the first and second lumbar segments of the spinal cord. Pain is thus referred to cutaneous regions innervated by somatic sensory nerves from the same spinal cord levels.

The patient was investigated by a CT scan.

Traditionally, a plain radiograph was used to look for the radiopaque stone (90% of renal stones are radiopaque) and this often proceeded to intravenous urography to determine precise location of renal stones. Currently, low-dose CT of the collecting system is used to visualize the renal stones and pinpoint the level of obstruction, using low radiation dose and no intravenous contrast.

An ultrasound scan may also be useful to assess for pelvicaliceal dilation and may reveal stones at the pelviureteral junction or the vesicoureteric junction. Ultrasound is also valuable for assessing other causes of obstruction (e.g., tumors at and around the ureteric orifices in the bladder) and is particularly useful in pregnant women when imaging with the use of radiation is a concern.

Usually an intravenous urogram would be carried out to enable assessment of the upper urinary tracts and precise location of the stone.

Not infrequently, CT scans of the abdomen are also obtained. These scans not only give information about the kidneys, ureters, and bladder but also show the position of the stone and other associated pathology.

If this patient’s infrascapular pain was on the right and predominantly within the right lower abdomen, appendicitis would also have to be excluded. A CT scan would enable differentiation of appendicitis and urinary colic.

A 27-year-old woman was admitted to the surgical ward with appendicitis. She underwent an appendectomy. It was noted at operation that the appendix had perforated and there was pus within the abdominal cavity. The appendix was removed and the stump tied. The abdomen was washed out with warm saline solution. The patient initially made an uneventful recovery, but by day 7 she had become unwell, with pain over her right shoulder and spiking temperatures.

While early-stage SSc is associated with edematous skin changes, skin thickening is the hallmark that distinguishes SSc from other connective tissue diseases. The distribution of skin thickening is invariably symmetric and bilateral. It typically starts in the fingers and then characteristically advances from distal to proximal extremities in an ascending fashion. The involved skin is firm, coarse, and thickened, and the extremities and trunk may be darkly pigmented. In some patients, diffuse tanning in the absence of sun exposure is a very early manifestation of skin involvement. In dark-skinned patients, vitiligolike hypopigmentation may occur. Because pigment loss spares the perifollicular areas, the skin may have a “salt-and-pepper” appearance, most prominently on the scalp, upper back, and chest. Dermal sclerosis due to collagen accumulation obliterates hair follicles, sweat glands, and eccrine and sebaceous glands, resulting in hair loss, decreased sweating, and dry skin. Transverse creases on the dorsum of the fingers disappear (Fig. 382-4). Fixed flexion contractures of the fingers cause reduced hand mobility and lead to muscle atrophy. Skin thickening in combination with fibrosis of the subjacent tendons accounts for contractures of the wrists, elbows, and knees. Thick ridges at the neck due

Dermatomyositis DM is a distinctive entity identified by a character istic rash accompanying, or more often preceding, muscle weakness. The rash may consist of a blue-purple discoloration on the upper eyelids with edema (heliotrope rash; see Fig. 73-3), a flat red rash on the face and upper trunk, and erythema of the knuckles with a raised violaceous scaly eruption (Gottron’s sign; see Fig. 73-4). The erythematous rash can also occur on other body surfaces, including the knees, elbows, malleoli, neck and anterior chest (often in a V sign), or back and shoulders (shawl sign), and may worsen after sun exposure. In some patients, the rash is pruritic, especially on the scalp, chest, and back. Dilated capillary loops at the base of the fingernails are also characteristic. The cuticles may be irregular, thickened, and distorted, and the lateral and palmar areas of the fingers may become rough and cracked, with irregular, “dirty” horizontal lines, resembling mechanic’s hands. The weakness can be mild, moderate, or severe enough to lead to quadriparesis. At times, the muscle strength appears normal, hence the term dermatomyositis sine myositis. When muscle biopsy is performed in such cases, however, significant perivascular and perimysial inflammation is often seen.

DM usually occurs alone but may overlap with scleroderma and mixed connective tissue disease. Fasciitis and thickening of the skin, similar to that seen in chronic cases of DM, have occurred in patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with the ingestion of contaminated l-tryptophan.

Management Intense and lengthy psychotherapy is required to effect significant improvement in patients who have personality disorders (177). There is increasing evidence that expert, targeted therapeutic interventions can be successful and that the long-term prognosis is more hopeful than previously believed. The challenge in the gynecology setting is to minimize contention and drain on medical staff while maximizing the likelihood of effective diagnosis and treatment of the patient’s medical problems. The most helpful single step is the identification of the personality disorder. Diagnosis enables the gynecologist to recognize the reasons for a patient’s problem behaviors, to avoid becoming entangled in fruitless interactions with the patient, and to set appropriate limits.

There is increasing evidence that psychotropic medications are useful adjuncts in the treatment of personality disorders (179). Treatment should be provided in consultation with a psychiatrist. The patient’s ability to use the medication can be compromised by impulsivity, self-destructive tendencies, and unstable relationships. Low doses of major tranquilizers are sometimes helpful, especially when the patient has brief psychotic episodes. Minor tranquilizers or anxiolytics pose significant risk of overdose and physical and psychological habituation (179). They can be prescribed for temporary stresses, but only in a quantity sufficient for several days and with no refill allowed. Some patients’ anxiety, demands, and power struggles are eased when they are given control over their own use of medication. Such an approach requires enough familiarity with the patient to ensure her safety and should be managed by an expert. Because the patient with a personality disorder attributes her problems to others, her symptoms cannot be adduced as reasons for psychiatric referral, but her suffering can be. If a diagnosis of a personality disorder absolutely must be noted in the patient’s chart or on insurance forms, it is essential that she be so informed. It is useful to review the DSM-IV-TR criteria with her so that she understands the basis for the diagnosis (9). All psychiatric diagnoses, but particularly personality disorders, carry a significant stigma.

Melatonin (3 to 12 mg) has reportedly been as effective as the sedative hypnotics and may cause fewer short-term side effects, but both of these statements are difficult to confirm. Melatonin has a short half-life, and it has only weak hypnotic effect. Therefore, for sleep rhythm disturbances, it is ideally taken 3 to 4 hours before sleep time. Tricyclic antidepressants appear to be sleep enhancing even in those who are not anxious or depressed. Tolerance develops to the drug, and there are morning side effects so the drug may find its best use in patients who are taking it for alternative reasons such as headache or depression. Some practitioners indicate that antidepressants may also worsen restless leg or periodic leg movement disorders. When pain is a factor in insomnia, the sedative may be combined with a suitable analgesic. Nonprescription drugs containing diphenhydramine (Benadryl), valerian, or doxylamine, which are minimally or not at all effective in inducing sleep, may impair the quality of sleep and lead to drowsiness the following morning.

The chronic insomniac who has no other symptoms should be discouraged from using sedative drugs. The solution of this problem is rarely to be found in medication. One should search out and correct, if possible, any underlying situational or psychologic difficulty, using medication only as a temporary measure. Patients should be encouraged to regularize their daily schedules, including their bedtimes, and to be physically active during the day but to avoid strenuous physical and mental activity before bedtime. It has been suggested that illumination from broad-spectrum light (television) in the late evening is detrimental. Dietary excesses must be corrected, and all nonessential medications interdicted. Coffee and alcohol should be avoided at night, if not throughout the day. A number of simple behavioral modifications may be useful, such as using the bedroom only for sleeping, arising at the same time each morning regardless of the duration of sleep, avoiding daytime naps, and limiting the time spent in bed strictly to the duration of sleep. A helpful approach is to lessen the patient’s concern about sleeplessness by pointing out that he will always get as much sleep as needed and that there is pleasure to be derived from staying awake and reading, or viewing a movie.

As a rule, anorexia nervosa begins shortly after puberty—sometimes later, but seldom after 30 years of age. Some of the patients were overweight in childhood, especially in the prepubertal period. Dieting is much talked about and may have been encouraged, especially by mothers who want their daughters to be more attractive. In epochs such as the current one, where dieting and female thinness are considered normative and desirable, the illness seems to be more common and lesser but transient forms of the disorder are rampant in high school-and college-age young women. Sometimes there appears to be a precipitating event, such as leaving home, disruption of family life, or other stress. Whatever the provocation, it leads to an obsessive refusal to eat. What is more important, the abnormal eating habits persist even when the patient has become painfully thin, and when counseled to eat normally she will use every artifice to starve herself. Food is hidden instead of being eaten, vomiting may be provoked after a meal, or the bowel may be emptied by laxatives. The patient shows no concern about her obvious emaciation and remains active. If left alone, these patients waste away, and approximately 5 percent have succumbed to some intercurrent infection or other medical complication, placing it among the most lethal of psychiatric conditions.

One is struck with the degree of emaciation; it exceeds that of most of the known wasting diseases. Often 30 percent or more of the body weight will have been lost by the time the patient’s family insists on medical consultation. Bradycardia and hypotension are indicators for hospitalization. A fine lanugo covers the face, body, and limbs. The skin is thin and dry, without its normal elasticity, and the nails are brittle. The dental enamel is eroded. Pubic hair and breast tissue (except for loss of fat) are normal, and, in this respect, anorexia nervosa is unlike hypopituitary cachexia (Simmonds disease). Surprisingly, however, there are no neurologic signs of nutritional deficiency. The patient is alert and cheerfully indifferent to her condition. Any suggestion that she is unattractively thin or seriously depleted is rejected.

Atypical Agents Medications considered atypical include venlafaxine, lithium salts, and anticonvulsants, which are effective mood stabilizers used for bipolar disorders (126–130). Bupropion is available in a once-a-day preparation. It lowers the seizure threshold slightly more than other antidepressants and should be avoided or used with caution in patients who have a history of head trauma. It is used, under a separate trade name, for smoking cessation, and is particularly useful for smokers who are depressed. Bupropion seems to cause fewer sexual side effects than the SSRIs and may decrease these side effects when added to an SSRI regimen.

Suicide The most acute issue in the assessment and referral of depressed patients is the possibility of suicide (131). Following are the risk factors for suicide:

Previous suicide attempts, even if seemingly not serious

Family history of suicide  A plan to commit suicide

Access to the means to carry out the plan

Women attempt suicide more frequently than men, but men complete the act more frequently than women (131,132). This is probably because men use more drastic or irreversible means, such as firearms, whereas women tend to overdose, which can be treated if discovered. It might seem that someone who repeatedly makes suicidal gestures is more interested in the responses of others than in ending her life. However, past attempts or gestures increase the risk of completed suicide. Patients who made a suicide attempt should be queried about the following risk factors: the intent to die (rather than escape, sleep, or make people understand her distress); increasing numbers or doses of drugs taken in a progression of attempts; and drug or alcohol misuse, especially if it, too, is increasing. Inquiry about suicidal ideation and behavior is an inherent part of every mental status examination and is mandatory for every patient with past or current depression or evidence of self-destructive behavior. The inquiry can follow from discussion of difficulties in the patient’s life or mood or be introduced with a comment that almost everyone has thoughts of death at one time or another. Nonsuicidal patients will immediately volunteer that they have had such thoughts and that they have no intention of acting on them. They will often add reasons: they have too much to look forward to, it is against their religion, or it would hurt their family.

In the United States, macular degeneration is the leading cause of permanent bilateral visual loss in the elderly.

Risk factors include age > 40 years, African-American ethnicity, diabetes, and myopia.

Hx/PE: Usually asymptomatic until late in the clinical course, when patients may begin to notice visual deficits. Should be suspected in patients > 35 years of age who need frequent lens changes and have mild headaches, visual disturbances, and impaired adaptation to darkness. The earliest visual defect is seen in the peripheral nasal fields. Cupping of the optic nerve head is seen on funduscopic exam.

Dx: Tonometry, ophthalmoscopic visualization of the optic nerve, and visual field testing are most important. A diseased trabecular meshwork obstructs proper drainage of the eye, gradually increasing pressure and leading to progressive vision loss.

Tx: Treat with topical β-blockers (timolol, betaxolol) to ↓ aqueous humor production or with pilocarpine to ↑ aqueous outﬂow. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may also be used. If medication fails, laser trabeculoplasty or a trabeculectomy can improve aqueous drainage.

Light entering the eye is focused by the cornea and then the biconvex lens onto the outer layer of the retina. The cornea, fluid of the anterior chamber, lens, vitreous, and retina itself must be transparent. The clarity of these media can be determined ophthalmoscopically, and a complete examination requires that the pupil be dilated to at least 6 mm in diameter. This is accomplished by instilling two drops of 2.5 percent phenylephrine and/or 0.5 to 1.0 percent tropicamide in each eye after the visual acuity has been measured, the pupillary response is recorded, and the intraocular pressure is estimated. In elderly persons, lower concentrations of these mydriatics should be used. The mydriatic action of phenylephrine lasts for 3 to 6 h. Rarely, an attack of angle-closure glaucoma (manifesting itself by diminished vision, ocular pain, nausea, and vomiting) may be precipitated by pharmacologic pupillary dilatation; this requires the administration of pilocarpine to the eye and the immediate attention of an ophthalmologist. It is advisable to have access to pilocarpine if the pupils are to be dilated.

By looking through a high-plus lens of the direct ophthalmoscope from a distance of 6 to 12 in, the examiner can visualize opacities in the refractive media; by adjusting the lenses from a high-plus to a zero or minus setting, it is possible to “depth-focus” from the cornea to the retina. Depending on the refractive error of the examiner, lenticular opacities are best seen within the range of +20 to +12. The retina comes into focus with +1 to -1 lenses. The illuminated pupil appears as a red circular structure (red reflex), the color being provided by blood in the capillaries of the choroid layer. The main limit of direct ophthalmoscopy is its inability to visualize lesions in the retina that lie anterior to the equator of the globe; these are seen only by the indirect method.

Exudative or neovascular (“wet”) macular degeneration: Much less common, but associated with more rapid and severe vision damage.

Funduscopy by an ophthalmologist reveals drusen and/or pigmentary changes in patients with atrophic AMD. Hemorrhage and subretinal ﬂuid are suggestive of exudative AMD.

Atrophic AMD:

No treatment is currently available, although a combination of vitamins (vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and zinc) has been found to slow disease progression.

An ↑ mortality rate from high doses of vitamin E and an elevated lung cancer incidence among individuals on beta-carotene supplementation may require modification of this regimen for smokers.

Exudative AMD:

VEGF inhibitors have been shown to improve vision (ranibizumab, bevacizumab) or slow visual loss (pegaptanib) in patients with exudative AMD.

Photodynamic therapy with verteporfin, which involves use of a laser to selectively target retinal vessels, may be useful in conjunction with VEGF inhibitors.

Occurs in elderly patients and is often idiopathic.

Hx/PE:

Central retinal artery occlusion: Presents with sudden, painless, unilateral blindness. The pupil reacts to a near stimulus but is sluggishly reactive to direct light. Patients present with a cherry-red spot on the fovea, retinal swelling (whitish appearance to the nerve fiber layer), and retinal arteries that may appear bloodless.

Central retinal vein occlusion: Characterized by rapid, painless vision loss of variable severity. A choked, swollen optic disk with hemorrhages, venous stasis retinal hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, and edema of the macula may be seen on funduscopic exam.

Occurs when the iris dilates and pushes against the lens of the eye, disrupting ﬂow of aqueous humor into the anterior chamber. Pressure in the posterior chamber then pushes the peripheral iris forward and blocks the angle.

Risk factors include family history, older age, Asian ethnicity, hyperopia, prolonged pupillary dilation (prolonged time in a dark area, stress, medications), anterior uveitis, and lens dislocation.

Hx/PE: Classically presents with extreme eye pain, blurred vision, headache, nausea, and vomiting. A hard, red eye is seen (from acute closure of a narrow anterior chamber angle); the pupil is dilated and nonreactive to light. IOP is ↑. If it resolves spontaneously prior to presentation (e.g., with pupillary constriction in sunlight), ophthalmologic examination may reveal narrow angles in one or both eyes.

Dx: Diagnosis is based on clinical history and examination. Those that resolve may mimic a migraine headache with blurred vision; the distinction is that the headaches and blurred vision are more likely to be triggered by darkness (due to pupillary dilation) rather than by bright lights (migraine).

A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 36-hour history of lower abdominal pain that was sharp and initially intermittent, later becoming constant and severe. The patient also reported feeling nauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have diarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours before admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative.

On physical examination there was tenderness in the right iliac fossa with guarding. On vaginal examination a tender mass in the right adnexal region was felt. The patient subsequently underwent a transvaginal ultrasound examination for evaluation of adnexal pathology. The scan showed a markedly enlarged right ovary measuring up to 8 cm in long axis with echogenic stroma and peripherally distributed follicles. There was no internal vascularity when color Doppler was applied. A small amount of free fluid was seen in the pouch of Douglas. The diagnosis of ovarian torsion was made.

Ovarian torsion is the twisting of an ovary on its suspensory ligament, which contains arterial, venous, and lymphatic vessels (forming so-called vascular pedicle), leading to a compromised blood supply. Initially, the venous and lymphatic circulation is compromised, resulting in ovarian edema and enlargement. The arterial flow is maintained longer due to thicker and less compressible arterial walls. Prolonged torsion leads to increased internal ovarian pressure that eventually results in arterial thrombosis, ischemia of the ovarian tissue, and necrosis. If the correct diagnosis and treatment are delayed, the patient may develop generalized sepsis.

The symptoms are nonspecific, making the diagnosis of ovarian torsion challenging. There is often no significant past medical history.

The classic symptom triad of ectopic pregnancy is pain, amenorrhea, and vaginal bleeding. This symptom group is present in about 50% of patients and is typical in patients with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Abdominal pain is the most common presenting symptom, but the severity and nature of the pain vary widely. There is no pathognomonic pain that is diagnostic of ectopic pregnancy. Pain may be unilateral or bilateral and may occur in the upper or lower abdomen. The pain may be dull, sharp, or crampy and either continuous or intermittent. With rupture, the patient may experience transient relief of the pain, as stretching of the tubal serosa ceases. Shoulder and back pain, thought to result from hemoperitoneal irritation of the diaphragm, may indicate intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

Physical Examination The physical examination should include measurements of vital signs and examination of the abdomen and pelvis. Frequently, the findings before rupture and hemorrhage are nonspecific, and vital signs are normal. The abdomen may be nontender or mildly tender, with or without rebound. The uterus may be slightly enlarged, with findings similar to a normal pregnancy (103,104). Cervical motion tenderness may or may not be present. An adnexal mass may be palpable in up to 50% of cases, but the mass varies markedly in size, consistency, and tenderness. A palpable mass may be the corpus luteum and not the ectopic pregnancy. With rupture and intra-abdominal hemorrhage, the patient develops tachycardia followed by hypotension. Bowel sounds are decreased or absent. The abdomen is distended, with marked tenderness and rebound tenderness. Cervical motion tenderness is present. Frequently, the findings of the pelvic examination are inadequate because of pain and guarding.

History and physical examination may or may not provide useful diagnostic information. The accuracy of the initial clinical evaluation is less than 50% (105). Additional tests are frequently required to differentiate early viable intrauterine pregnancy or suspected ectopic or abnormal intrauterine pregnancy.

IBS is a disorder that affects all ages, although most patients have their first symptoms before age 45. Older individuals have a lower reporting frequency. Women are diagnosed with IBS two to three times as often as men and make up 80% of the population with severe IBS. As indicated in Table 352-1, pain or abdominal discomfort is a key symptom for the diagnosis of IBS. These symptoms should be improved with defecation and/or have their onset associated with a change in frequency or form of stool. Painless diarrhea or constipation does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria to be classified as IBS. Supportive symptoms that are not part of the diagnostic criteria include defecation straining, urgency or a feeling of incomplete bowel movement, passing mucus, and bloating.

Abdominal Pain According to the current IBS diagnostic criteria, abdominal pain or discomfort is a prerequisite clinical feature of IBS. Abdominal pain in IBS is highly variable in intensity and location. It is frequently episodic and crampy, but it may be superimposed on a background of constant ache. Pain may be mild enough to be ignored or it may interfere with daily activities. Despite this, malnutrition due to inadequate caloric intake is exceedingly rare with IBS. Sleep deprivation is also unusual because abdominal pain is almost uniformly present only during waking hours. However, patients with severe IBS frequently wake repeatedly during the night; thus, nocturnal pain is a poor discriminating factor between organic and functional bowel disease. Pain is often exacerbated by eating or emotional stress and improved by passage of flatus or stools. In addition, female patients with IBS commonly report worsening symptoms during the premenstrual and menstrual phases.

As stated earlier, symptoms of the same nature as those in hysteria occur in men, most often in those trying to avoid legal difficulties or military service or attempting to obtain disability or compensation following injury. Sociopaths often present with this type of illness. Unless such a motivating factor can be identified, the diagnosis of hysteria in the male should be made with caution. In compensation neurosis, as in the classic form of hysteria, multiple symptoms are reported; many of the symptoms are the same as those listed under female hysteria. Or the patient may be monosymptomatic (e.g., “seizures”) and the symptoms, particularly chronic pain, may be confined to the neck, head, arm, or low back. The description of symptoms tends to be lengthy and circumstantial, and the patient fails to give details that are necessary for diagnosis. A tangible gain from the illness may be discovered by simple questioning. This is usually in the form of monetary compensation, which, surprisingly, is sometimes less than that which the patient could earn if he returned to work. Most such patients are actively engaged in litigation when first seen. Another interesting feature is the frequency with which the patient expresses extreme dissatisfaction with the medical care given him; he is often hostile toward the physicians and nurses. Many of these patients have already been subjected to an excessive number of hospitalizations and rather dramatic mishaps have allegedly occurred in carrying out diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The majority of these patients were previously suspected of malingering.

Curiously, women who suffer injury at work or are involved in auto accidents may exhibit the same symptoms and signs of compensation neurosis as men, but in our experience, do so infrequently or at least less overtly.

Anxiety disorder is a chronic state, some would say a disease, punctuated by recurrent attacks of acute anxiety or panic. The acute attacks are the hallmark of the disease and some psychiatrists are reluctant to make a diagnosis of anxiety neurosis in their absence. Because of the clinical features of panic attacks and particularly their episodic nature, simulating an acute medical condition, they are of special interest to neurologists and general physicians. While anxiety may be inferred from observing the activities of young children, and is reported as a form of nervousness by older children and adolescents, more often there are physical complaints at times of transition or stress during the day or year.

Panic attacks in their full form are prone to begin after this age and are almost as dramatic as seizures. They often begin with distressing feelings of dread and foreboding. The patient is assailed by a sense of strangeness, as though his body had changed or the surroundings were unreal. He is frightened, sometimes by the prospect of imminent death (angor animi) or of losing his mind or self-control. There may be a feeling of smothering. “I am dying” or “I can’t breathe” are characteristic expressions of alarm and panic. The heart races, breathing comes in rapid gasps, the pupils may be dilated, and the patient may sweat or tremble. The palpitation and breathing difficulties are so prominent that a cardiologist is often consulted. Some of our psychiatric colleagues identify breathlessness or a suffocating feeling as central to the diagnosis of panic (and attribute psychologic meaning to the symptom), but this is not sustained in our observations of affected patients. The symptoms abate spontaneously after 15 to 30 min, leaving the patient shaken, tense, perplexed, and often embarrassed. There is no confusion, and after the episode there is full memory of the event.

In our experience, delusions are more common in older patients and tend to appear only after weeks or months of more typical symptoms of depression. Common ones in experience with our patients have been gas poisoning in the house, unaccustomed suspiciousness, alleged home break ins, having inadequate money, or being stolen from or cheated. (Some of these arise in early dementia as well.) Hallucinations, when they occur, are

infarction (Wishnie et al). Usually it begins toward the end of the patient’s stay in the hospital and attracts little attention. Once the patient is home, fatigability that approaches exhaustion may be the main complaint and interfere with accustomed activities and rehabilitation. It may be described as weakness and falsely attributed to heart failure. Symptoms of irritability, anxiety, and despondency are next in order of frequency, followed by insomnia and feelings of aimlessness and boredom.

Of particular significance is the reactive depression that occurs on learning of a serious medical or neurologic disease. Often such an emotional reaction, which the physician may tend to ignore, is the dominant manifestation of a disease that threatens the life pattern and independence of the patient. Recognition by the patient that he has suffered a stroke or that he has cancer, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Parkinson disease, is almost always followed by some degree of reactive depression, often with an element of anxiety. A prime example is depression that follows myocardial infarction (Wishnie et

The depressed patient tends to move slowly, sighing is frequent, and speech is reduced. The mental life of such an individual may narrow to a single-minded concern about physical or mental health. In dialogue, the patient’s responses become so stereotyped that the listener can soon predict exactly what is going to be said. There is a poverty of ideation and sometimes a notable absence of insight. Consciousness is clear, and although there is no evidence of a schizophrenic type of thought disorder, delusional ideas, and less often hallucinations, may be prominent in some patients, justifying the term

The typical history for appendicitis is a central abdominal, colicky (intermittent waxing and waning) pain, which over a period of hours localizes to become a constant pain in the right iliac fossa. The central colicky pain is typical for a poorly localized visceral type of pain. As the parietal peritoneum becomes inflamed, the pain becomes localized. Although this patient does have right iliac fossa pain, the history is not typical for appendicitis (although it must be remembered that patients may not always have a classical history for appendicitis).

The surgical intern asked a more senior colleague for an opinion.

The senior colleague considered other anatomical structures that lie within the right iliac fossa as a potential cause of pain. These include the appendix, the cecum, and the small bowel. Musculoskeletal pain and referred pain could also be potential causes. In women, pain may also arise from the ovary, fallopian tube, and uterus. In a young patient, diseases of these organs are rare. Infection and pelvic inflammatory disease may occur in the younger patient and need to be considered.

The patient gave no history of these disorders.

Upon further questioning, however, the patient revealed that her last menstrual period was 6 weeks before this examination. The senior physician realized that a potential cause of the abdominal pain was a pregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy). The patient was rushed for an abdominal ultrasound, which revealed no fetus or sac in the uterus. She was also noted to have a positive pregnancy test. The patient underwent surgery and was found to have a ruptured fallopian tube caused by an ectopic pregnancy.

Whenever a patient has apparent pelvic pain, it is important to consider the gender-related anatomical differences. Ectopic pregnancy should always be considered in women of childbearing age.

A 35-year-old woman visited her family practitioner because she had a “bloating” feeling and an increase in abdominal girth. The family practitioner examined the lower abdomen, which revealed a mass that extended from the superior pubic rami to the level of the umbilicus. The superior margin of the mass was easily palpated, but the inferior margin appeared to be less well defined.

History A thorough history and physical examination are critical to the evaluation of fecal incontinence and defecatory dysfunction. The history of present illness should focus on the bowel habits, including frequency and consistency of bowel movements (hard vs. soft, formed vs. unformed, diarrhea vs. constipation). Determining the duration and severity of symptoms, as well as exacerbating factors, is important for understanding the impact on quality of life. Patients should be questioned about straining with bowel movements, symptoms of incomplete emptying, and splinting of the perianal region, perineal body, or posterior vaginal wall to assist

with evacuation. Patients should also be asked about the need to perform digital disimpaction because they are unlikely to volunteer this information. With respect to fecal incontinence, information should be obtained about leakage with solids, liquid, and ﬂatus and the ability to discriminate between these different types of stool (sampling). Similar to urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence can be stress related, urge related, or unconscious. Questions about alternating diarrhea and constipation, mucus or blood in the stools, constitutional symptoms, and changes in stool caliber can help the investigator uncover systemic and functional etiologies. Finally, it is important to ask about adaptive behaviors, incontinence product usage, and past and present treatments, including surgery, physical therapy, and medications.

A 50-year-old woman was admitted to hospital for surgical resection of the uterus (hysterectomy) for cancer. The surgeon was also going to remove all the pelvic lymph nodes and carry out a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of uterine tubes and ovaries). The patient was prepared for this procedure and underwent routine surgery. Twenty-five hours after surgery, it was noted that the patient had passed no urine and her abdomen was expanding. An ultrasound scan demonstrated a considerable amount of fluid within the abdomen. Fluid withdrawn from the abdomen was tested and found to be urine.

It was postulated that this patient’s ureters had been damaged during the surgery.

The pelvic part of the ureter courses posteroinferiorly and external to the parietal peritoneum on the lateral wall of the pelvis anterior to the internal iliac artery. It continues in its course to a point approximately 2 cm superior to the ischial spine and then passes anteromedially and superior to the levator ani muscles. Importantly, the ureter closely adheres to the peritoneum. The only structure that passes between the ureter and the peritoneum in men is the ductus deferens. In women, however, as the ureter descends on the pelvic wall, it passes under the uterine artery. The ureter continues close to the lateral fornix of the vagina, especially on the left, and enters the posterosuperior angle of the bladder.

It was at this point that the ureter was inadvertently damaged.

Knowing the anatomy and recognizing the possibility of ureteric damage enabled the surgeons to reestablish continuity of the ureter surgically. The patient was hospitalized a few days longer than expected and made an uneventful recovery.

A 25-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with a complaint of pain in her right iliac fossa. The pain had developed rapidly over approximately 40 minutes and was associated with cramps and vomiting. The surgical intern made an initial diagnosis of appendicitis.

Patients with a bileaﬂet aortic valve with no risk factors (atrial fibrillation, previous thromboembolism, left ventricular dysfunction, a hypercoagulable state, older generation thrombogenic valve) generally do not require anticoagulation bridging. Warfarin should be stopped 72 hours prior to the procedure and resumed 24 hours after the procedure. In contrast, patients with a mechanical aortic valve and any above mentioned risk factor, or a mechanical mitral valve, should be bridged with intravenous unfractionated heparin when the INR falls below 2. The heparin drip should be stopped approximately 6 to 8 hours before the procedure and restarted as soon as possible after surgery when the patient is deemed stable from postoperative bleeding risk. The heparin bridge can be stopped when the INR reaches therapeutic levels (207).

In the postoperative period, patients with mitral stenosis should be carefully monitored for pulmonary edema because they may not be able to compensate for the amount of intravenous ﬂuid administered during surgery. Prevention of tachycardia is important, as it may lead to pulmonary edema. Patients with mitral stenosis frequently have pulmonary hypertension and decreased airway compliance. They may require more pulmonary support and therapy postoperatively, including prolonged mechanical ventilation.

Surgical exploration seldom is required because the accumulated hema-toma tamponades the bleed. Indications for surgical explora-tion include ongoing transfusion requirement, hemodynamic instability, and graft dysfunction from hematoma compression. For recipients on anticoagulation or antiplatelet treatments, the threshold for surgical exploration is lower.

Noninvasive Imaging Modalities • vEnous ultrasonography Ultrasonography of the deep venous system relies on loss of vein compressibility as the primary criterion for DVT. When a normal vein is imaged in cross-section, it readily collapses with gentle manual pressure from the ultrasound transducer. This creates the illusion of a “wink.” With acute DVT, the vein loses its compressibility because of passive distention by acute thrombus. The diagnosis of acute DVT is even more secure when thrombus is directly visualized. It appears homogeneous and has low echogenicity (Fig. 300-4). The vein itself often appears mildly dilated, and collateral channels may be absent.

Venous flow dynamics can be examined with Doppler imaging. Normally, manual calf compression causes augmentation of the Doppler flow pattern. Loss of normal respiratory variation is caused by an obstructing DVT or by any obstructive process within the pelvis. For patients with a technically poor or nondiagnostic venous ultrasound, one should consider alternative imaging modalities for DVT, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging.

A neck radiograph and coronal CT image of the neck demonstrates a cervical rib (eFig. 3.116).

Cervical ribs may produce three distinct disease entities:

Arterial compression and embolization—the cervical rib (or band) on the undersurface of the distal portion of the subclavian artery reduces the diameter of the vessel and allows eddy currents to form. Platelets aggregate and atheroma may develop in this region. This debris can be dislodged and flow distally within the upper limb vessels to block off blood flow to the fingers and the hand, a condition called distal embolization.

Tension on the T1 nerve—the T1 nerve, which normally passes over rib I, is also elevated by the presence of a cervical rib; thus the patient may experience a sensory disturbance over the medial aspect of the forearm, and develop wasting of the intrinsic muscles of the hand.

Compression of the subclavian vein—this may induce axillary vein thrombosis.

A Doppler ultrasound scan revealed marked stenosis of the subclavian artery at the outer border of the rib with abnormal flow distal to the narrowing. Within this region of abnormal flow there was evidence of thrombus adherent to the vessel wall.

This patient underwent surgical excision of the cervical rib and had no further symptoms.

A 52-year-old man presented with headaches and shortness of breath. He also complained of coughing up small volumes of blood. Clinical examination revealed multiple dilated veins around the neck. A chest radiograph demonstrated an elevated diaphragm on the right and a tumor mass, which was believed to be a primary bronchogenic carcinoma.

By observing the clinical findings and applying anatomical knowledge, the site of the tumor can be inferred.

The multiple dilated veins around the neck are indicative of venous obstruction. The veins are dilated on both sides of the neck, implying that the obstruction must be within a common vessel, the superior vena cava. Anterior to the superior vena cava in the right side of the chest is the phrenic nerve, which supplies the diaphragm. Because the diaphragm is elevated, suggesting paralysis, it is clear that the phrenic nerve has been involved with the tumor.

2023-11-29 14:12:07,767 query: A 62-year-old man is brought to his primary care physician by his wife who is concerned about the patient's frequent falls. Approximately 6 months ago, she started noticing that he was walking more slowly than usual. He has fallen more than 6 times in the past month, and she is worried that he will sustain a serious injury if he does not stop falling. The patient is a retired banking executive and was active as a triathlete until the age of 60. He does not smoke and drinks 2-3 alcoholic beverages per day. His family history is notable for normal pressure hydrocephalus in his mother and Alzheimer dementia in his father. His temperature is 97.8°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 131/81 mmHg, pulse is 68/min, and respirations are 19/min. On exam, his movements appear slowed and forced. He shuffles his feet when he walks. Tone is increased in his upper and lower extremities bilaterally. This patient's condition is most strongly associated with which of the following histologic findings on brain autopsy?

Bleeding from right colonic vascular ectasias in the elderly may be overt or occult; it tends to be chronic and only occasionally is hemodynamically significant. Endoscopic hemostatic therapy may be useful in the treatment of vascular ectasias, as well as discrete bleeding ulcers and postpolypectomy bleeding. Surgical therapy is generally required for major, persistent, or recurrent bleeding from the wide variety of colonic sources of GIB that cannot be treated medically, angiographically, or endoscopically.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT:

Measurement of the heart rate and blood pressure is the best way to initially assess a patient with GIB. Clinically significant bleeding leads to postural changes in heart rate or blood pressure, tachycardia, and, finally, recumbent hypotension. In contrast, the hemoglobin does not fall immediately with acute GIB, due to proportionate reductions in plasma and red cell volumes (i.e., “people bleed whole blood”). Thus, hemoglobin may be normal or only minimally decreased at the initial presentation of a severe bleeding episode. As extravascular fluid enters the vascular space to restore volume, the hemoglobin falls, but this process may take up to 72 h. Transfusion is recommended when the hemoglobin drops below 7 g/dL, based on a large randomized trial showing this restrictive transfusion strategy decreases rebleeding and death in acute UGIB compared with a transfusion threshold of 9 g/dL. Patients with slow, chronic GIB may have very low hemoglobin values despite normal blood pressure and heart rate. With the development of iron-deficiency anemia, the mean corpuscular volume will be low and red blood cell distribution width will increase.

Certain anticoagulants, such as fractionated low-molecularweight heparin, may need to be avoided or dose-adjusted in these patients, with monitoring of factor Xa activity where available. It is often more prudent to use conventional unfractionated heparin, titrated to the measured partial thromboplastin time, in hospitalized patients requiring an alternative to warfarin anticoagulation. The new classes of oral anticoagulants are all, in part, renally eliminated and need dose adjustment in the face of decreased GFR (Chap. 143).

Central nervous system (CNS), peripheral, and autonomic neuropathy as well as abnormalities in muscle structure and function are all well-recognized complications of CKD. Subtle clinical manifestations of uremic neuromuscular disease usually become evident at stage 3 CKD. Early manifestations of CNS complications include mild disturbances in memory and concentration and sleep disturbance. Neuromuscular irritability, including hiccups, cramps, and twitching, becomes evident at later stages. In advanced untreated kidney failure, asterixis, myoclonus, seizures, and coma can be seen.

Peripheral neuropathy usually becomes clinically evident after the patient reaches stage 4 CKD, although electrophysiologic and histologic evidence occurs earlier. Initially, sensory nerves are involved more than motor, lower extremities more than upper, and distal parts of the extremities more than proximal. The “restless leg syndrome” is characterized by ill-defined sensations of sometimes debilitating discomfort in the legs and feet relieved by frequent leg movement. If dialysis is not instituted soon after onset of sensory abnormalities, motor involvement follows, including muscle weakness. Evidence of peripheral neuropathy without another cause (e.g., diabetes mellitus) is an indication for starting renal replacement therapy. Many of the complications described above will resolve with dialysis, although subtle nonspecific abnormalities may persist.

This condition is now relatively infrequent but is an important cause of confusion, convulsions, stupor, and coma; as such, it merits separate consideration as a metabolic disorder of the brain. The essential biochemical abnormality is a critical lowering of the blood glucose. At a level of about 30 mg/dL, the cerebral disorder takes the form of a confusional state and one or more seizures may occur; at a level of 10 mg/dL, there is coma that may result in irreparable injury to the brain if not corrected immediately by the administration of glucose. As with most other metabolic encephalopathies, the rate of decline of blood glucose is a factor in both the depression of consciousness and residual dementia.

The normal brain has a glucose reserve of 1 to 2 g (30 mmol/100 g of tissue), mostly in the form of glycogen. Because glucose is utilized by the brain at a rate of 60 to 80 mg/min, the glucose reserve may sustain cerebral activity for 30 min or less once blood glucose is no longer available. Glucose is transported from the blood to the brain by an active carrier system. Glucose entering the brain either undergoes glycolysis or is stored as glycogen. During normal oxygenation (aerobic metabolism), glucose is converted to pyruvate, which enters the Krebs cycle; with anaerobic metabolism, lactate is formed. The oxidation of 1 mole of glucose requires 6 mole of O2. Of the glucose taken up by the brain, 85 to 90 percent is oxidized; the remainder is used in the formation of proteins and other substances, notably neurotransmitters and particularly gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

Hypoglycemia Philip E. Cryer, Stephen N. Davis Hypoglycemia is most commonly caused by drugs used to treat diabe-tes mellitus or by exposure to other drugs, including alcohol. However, a number of other disorders, including critical organ failure, sepsis and inanition, hormone deficiencies, non-β-cell tumors, insulinoma, 420 and prior gastric surgery, can cause hypoglycemia (Table 420-1). Hypoglycemia is most convincingly documented by Whipple’s triad: (1) symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia, (2) a low plasma glucose concentration measured with a precise method (not a glucose monitor), and (3) relief of symptoms after the plasma glucose level is raised. The lower limit of the fasting plasma glucose concentration is normally ∼70 mg/dL (∼3.9 mmol/L), but lower venous glucose levels occur normally, late after a meal, during pregnancy, and during prolonged fasting (>24 h). Hypoglycemia can cause serious morbidity; if severe and prolonged, it can be fatal. It should be considered in any patient with episodes of confusion, an altered level of consciousness, or a seizure.

Glucose is an obligate metabolic fuel for the brain under physiologic conditions. The brain cannot synthesize glucose or store more than a few minutes’ supply as glycogen and therefore requires a continuous supply of glucose from the arterial circulation. As the arterial plasma glucose concentration falls below the physiologic range, blood-tobrain glucose transport becomes insufficient to support brain energy metabolism and function. However, redundant glucose counterregulatory mechanisms normally prevent or rapidly correct hypoglycemia.

Starting out in high growth percentiles, many children assumea lower percentile between 6 and 18 months until they matchtheir genetic programming, then grow along new, lower percentiles. They usually do not decrease more than two major percentiles and have normal developmental, behavioral, and physicalexaminations. These children with catch-down growth should be followed closely, but no further evaluation is warranted.

Infants born small for gestational age, or prematurely, ingestmore breast milk or formula and, unless there are complicationsthat require extra calories, usually exhibit catch-up growth in the first 6 months. These infants should be fed on demand and provided as much as they want unless they are vomiting (notjust spitting up [see Chapter 128]). Some may benefit from ahigher caloric content formula. Many psychosocial risk factorsthat may have led to being born small or early may contributeto nonorganic failure to thrive (see Chapter 21). Converselyinfants who recover from being low birth weight or prematurehave an increased risk of developing childhood obesity.

Growth of the nervous system is most rapid in the first 2 years, correlating with increasing physical, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive development. There is again rapid change during adolescence. Osseous maturation (bone age) is determined from radiographs on the basis of the number and size of calcified epiphyseal centers; the size, shape, density, and sharpness of outline of the ends of bones; and the distance separating the epiphyseal center from the zone of provisional calcification.

Parallel to the changes in the developing brain (i.e., cognition, language, behavior) are changes in the physical development of the body.

document (1) 

Head circumference: Measured routinely in the first two years. ↑ head circumference can indicate hydrocephalus or tumor; ↓ head circumference can point to microcephaly (e.g., TORCH infections).

Height and weight: Measured routinely until adulthood. The pattern of growth is more important than the raw numbers. Infants may lose 5–10% of birth weight (BW) over the first few days but should return to their BW by 14 days. Infants can be expected to double their BW by 4–5 months, triple by one year, and quadruple by two years.

Failure to thrive: Persistent weight less than the 5th percentile for age or “falling off the growth curve” (i.e., crossing two major percentile lines on a growth chart). Classified as follows:

Organic: Due to an underlying medical condition such as cystic fibro-sis, congenital heart disease, celiac sprue, pyloric stenosis, chronic infection (e.g., HIV), and GERD.

Nonorganic: Primarily due to psychosocial factors such as maternal depression, neglect, or abuse.

A careful dietary history and close observation of maternal-infant interactions (especially preparation of formula and feeding) are critical to diagnosis.

Children should be hospitalized if there is evidence of neglect or severe malnourishment. Calorie counts and supplemental nutrition (if breastfeeding is inadequate) are mainstays of treatment.

Tanner staging: Performed to assess physical development in boys and girls. Stage 1 is preadolescent; stage 5 is adult. Increasing stages are assigned for testicular and penile growth in boys and breast growth in girls; pubic hair development is used for both stages.

Girls: The average age of puberty is 10.5 years. Generally the order of progression is thelarche (breast bud development) → pubarche (pubic hair development) → growth spurt → menarche (first menstrual bleeding). The average age of menarche in United States girls is 12.5 years.

A second broad group of children with speech delay or slow speech development (no words by 18 months, no phrases by 30 months) comprises those in whom an overt pathologic basis is evident. In clinics where children of the latter type are studied systematically, 35 to 50 percent of cases occur in those with global developmental delay or “cerebral palsy.” Hearing deficit explains many of the other cases, as discussed later, and a few represent what appears to be a specific lack of maturation of the motor speech areas or an acquired lesion in these parts. Only in this small, latter group is it appropriate to refer to the language disorder as aphasia, that is, a derangement or loss of language caused by a cerebral lesion. Aphasia, when it occurs as the result of an acquired lesion (vascular, traumatic) is essentially of the motor variety and typically lasts but a few months in the child. It may be accompanied by a right-sided hemiplegia. An interesting type of acquired aphasia, possibly encephalitic, has been described by Landau and Kleffner in association with seizures and bitemporal focal discharges in the EEG (see “Seizures Presenting in Early Childhood” in Chap. 16).

Speech delay caused by congenital deafness, whether peripheral (loss of pure-tone acuity) or central (pure-tone threshold normal by audiogram), is a most important condition but may at first be difficult to discern. One suspects that faulty hearing is causal when there is a history of familial deaf mutism, congenital rubella, erythroblastosis fetalis, meningitis, chronic bilateral ear infections, or the administration of ototoxic drugs to the pregnant mother or newborn infant—the well-known antecedents of deafness. It is estimated that approximately 3 million American children have hearing defects; 0.1 percent of the school population are deaf and 1.5 percent are hard of hearing. The parents’ attention may be drawn to a defect in hearing when the infant fails to heed loud noises, to turn the eyes to sound sources outside the immediate visual fields, and to react to music; but in other instances, it is the delay in speaking that calls attention to it.

document (3) 

As already mentioned, the deaf child makes the transition from crying to cooing and babbling at the usual age of 3 to 5 months. After the sixth month, however, the child becomes much quieter, and the usual repertoire of babbling sounds becomes stereotyped and unchanging, though still uttered with pleasant voice. A more conspicuous failure comes somewhat later, when babbling fails to give way to word formation. Should deafness develop within the first few years of life, the child gradually loses such speech as had been acquired but can be retaught by the lipreading method. Speech, however, is harsh, poorly modulated, and unpleasant, and accompanied by many peculiar squeals and snorting or grunting noises. Social and other acquisitions appear at the expected times in the congenitally deaf child, unlike in the developmentally delayed child. The deaf child seems eager to communicate and makes known all his needs by gesture or pantomime, often very cleverly. The deaf child may attract attention by vivid facial expressions, motions of the lips, nodding, or head shaking. The Leiter performance scale, which makes no use of sounds, will show that intelligence is normal. Deafness can be demonstrated at an early age by careful observation of the child’s responses to sounds and by free-field audiometry, but the full range of hearing cannot be accurately tested before the age of 3 or 4 years. Recording of brainstem auditory evoked potentials and testing of the labyrinths, which are frequently unresponsive in deaf mutes, may be helpful. Early diagnosis is important so as to fit the child with a hearing aid and to begin appropriate language training.

In contrast to the child in whom deafness is the only abnormality, the developmentally delayed child generally talks little but may display a rich personality. Autistic children may also be mute; if they speak, echolalia is prominent and the personal “I” is avoided. Blind children of normal intelligence tend to speak slowly and fail to acquire imitative gestures.

A 32-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with weakness and hypokalemia. The patient had been very healthy until 2 months previously when he developed intermittent leg weakness. His review of systems was otherwise negative. He denied drug or laxative abuse and was on no medications. Past medical history was unremarkable, with no history of neuromuscular disease. Family history was notable for a sister with thyroid disease. Physical examination was notable only for reduced deep tendon reflexes.

This patient developed hypokalemia due to a redistribution of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular compartments; this pathophysiology was readily apparent following calculation of the TTKG. The TTKG is calculated as (P × U )/(P ×

U ). The expected values for the TTKG are <3 in the presence of hypokalemia and >7–8 in the presence of hyperkalemia (see also Case 2 and Case 8). Alternatively, a urinary K+-to-creatinine ratio of >13 mmol/g creatinine (>1.5 mmol/mmol creatinine) is compatible with excessive renal K+ excretion. In this case, the calculated TTKG was 2.5, consistent with appropriate renal conservation of K+ and a nonrenal cause for hypokalemia. In the absence of significant gastrointestinal loss of K+, the patient was diagnosed with a “redistributive” subtype of hypokalemia.

The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly.

The plasma Na+ concentration on admission was 113 meq/L, with a creatinine of 2.35 (Table 64e-1). At hospital hour 7, the plasma Na+ concentration was 120 meq/L, potassium 5.4 meq/L, chloride 90 64e-5 meq/L, bicarbonate 22 meq/L, BUN 32 mg/dL, creatinine 2.02 mg/dL, glucose 89 mg/dL, total protein 5.0, and albumin 1.9. The hematocrit was 33.9, white count 7.6, and platelets 405. A morning cortisol was 19.5, with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 1.7. The patient was treated with 1 μg of intravenous DDAVP, along with 75 mL/h of intravenous half-normal saline. After the plasma Na+ concentration dropped to 116 meq/L, intravenous fluid was switched to normal saline at the same infusion rate. The subsequent results are shown in Table 64e-1.

This patient presented with hypovolemic hyponatremia and a “prerenal” reduction in GFR, with an increase in serum creatinine. She had experienced diarrhea for some time and manifested an orthostatic tachycardia after a liter of normal saline. As expected for hypovolemic hyponatremia, the urine Na+ concentration was <20 meq/L in the absence of congestive heart failure or other causes of hypervolemic hyponatremia, and she responded to saline hydration with an increase in plasma Na+ concentration and a decrease in creatinine.

2023-11-29 14:12:10,382 query: A 39-year-old African-American woman presents to the emergency room with hip pain. She has a past medical history significant for sarcoidosis which was recently diagnosed 6 months ago and is currently being treated. She reports that the pain started 2 weeks ago and is localized to the left hip and groin. The pain has been getting progressively more intense. Her temperature is 98.1°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 122/78 mm Hg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for pain with manipulation without restriction of range of motion of the hip. Which of the following is the most sensitive test for this condition?

This is an oblique fracture of the distal tibia without a fibula fracture. There is often no significant trauma. Patients are usually 1 to 3 years old, but can be as old as 6 and present with limping and pain with weight bearing. There may be minimal swelling and pain. Initial radiographs do not always show the fracture; if symptoms persist, a repeat x-ray in 7 to 10 days may be helpful.

Child abuse must always be considered in the differential diagnosis of a child with fractures, especially in those younger than 3 years (see Chapter 22). Common fracture patterns that should increase the index of suspicion include multiple fractures in different stages of radiographic healing, metaphyseal corner fractures (shaking), fractures too severe for the history, or fractures in nonambulatory infants. Although spiral fractures of long bones were historically considered pathognomic for abuse, they can be seen in nonabuse situations.

When there is concern for child abuse, the child should have a full evaluation, which may include admission to the hospital. A thorough and well-documented physical examination should focus on soft tissue injuries, the cranium, and a funduscopic examination for retinal hemorrhages or detachment. A skeletal survey or a bone scan may be helpful in identifying other fractures.

The hip is a ball (femoral head) and socket (acetabulum) joint that is important for skeletal stability. The femoral head and acetabulum are interdependent for normal growth and development. The femoral neck and head, which contain the capital femoral epiphysis, are intra-articular. The blood supply to this region is unique because the blood vessels are extraosseous and lie on the surface of the femoral neck, entering the epiphysis peripherally. Thus, the blood supply to the femoral head is vulnerable to trauma, infection, and other causes that may increase intra-articular pressure. Damage to the blood supply can lead to avascular necrosis.

The pain of herniated intervertebral disc varies in severity from a mild aching discomfort to severe knife-like stabs that radiate the length of the leg and are superimposed on a constant intense ache. Sciatic pain is perceived by the patient as originating deep in the buttock and radiating to the posterolateral thigh; it may progress to the calf and ankle—to the medial malleolus (L4), lateral malleolus (L5), or heel (S1). Distal radiation to the foot is infrequent and should raise concern of an alternative process. Abortive forms of sciatica may produce aching discomfort only in the lower buttock or proximal thigh and occasionally only in the lower hamstring or upper calf. With the most severe pain, the patient is forced to stay in bed, avoiding the slightest movement; a cough, sneeze, or strain is intolerable. The most comfortable position is lying on the back with legs flexed at the knees and hips and the shoulders raised on pillows to obliterate the lumbar lordosis. For some patients, a lateral decubitus position is more comfortable. Free fragments of disc that find their way to a lateral and posterior position in the spinal canal may produce the opposite situation, one whereby the patient is unable to extend the spine and lie supine. Sitting and standing up from a sitting position are particularly painful. It is surprising to patients that a lumbar disc protrusion may cause little or no back pain. As a corollary, the presence of lumbar disc disease, even frank rupture, bears an inconsistent relationship to low back pain, as already emphasized.

In cases of root compression, pain is also characteristically provoked by pressure along the course of the sciatic nerve at the classic points of Valleix (sciatic notch, retrotrochanteric gutter, posterior surface of thigh, and head of fibula). Pressure at one point may cause radiation of pain and tingling down the leg.

In the sitting position, flexion of the spine can be performed more easily, even to the point of bringing the knees in contact with the chest. The reason for this is that knee flexion relaxes tightened hamstring muscles and relieves the stretch on the sciatic nerve.

Examination with the patient in the reclining position yields much the same information as in the standing and sitting positions. With lumbosacral disc lesions and sciatica, passive lumbar flexion causes little pain and is not limited as long as the hamstrings are relaxed and there is no stretching of the sciatic nerve. Thus, with the knees flexed to 90 degrees, sitting up from the reclining position is unimpeded and not painful; with knees extended, there is pain and limited motion (Kraus-Weber test). With vertebral disease, passive flexion of the hips is free, whereas flexion of the lumbar spine may be impeded and painful.

The most helpful signs in detecting nerve root compression are passive straight-leg raising (possible up to almost 90° in normal individuals) with the patient supine and variations of this test. Raising the straight leg places the sciatic nerve and its roots under tension, thereby producing radicular, radiating pain from the buttock through the posterior thigh if there is compression of these neural structures. This maneuver is the usual way in which compression of the L5 or S1 nerve root is detected (Lasègue sign), however, it may also cause an anterior rotation of the pelvis around a transverse axis, increasing stress on the lumbosacral joint and causing milder radiating pain if this joint is arthritic or otherwise diseased. Straight raising of the opposite leg (“crossed straight-leg raising,” Fajersztajn sign) may also cause pain on the affected side and is a more specific sign of prolapsed disc than is the Lasègue sign but far less sensitive. The many derivatives of the straight-leg raising sign are discussed in the section on lumbar disc disease further on and summarized in the review by Ropper and Zafonte. Asking the seated patient to extend the leg so that the sole of the foot can be inspected is a way of checking for a feigned Lasègue sign.

document (3) 

Elongation of the nerve root by straight-leg raising or by flexing the leg at the hip and extending it at the knee (Lasègue maneuver discussed earlier) is the most consistent of all pain-provoking signs. During straight-leg raising, the patient can distinguish between the discomfort of ordinary tautness of the hamstring and the sharper, less-familiar root pain, particularly when asked to compare the experience with that on the normal side. Many variations of the Lasègue maneuver have been described (with numerous eponyms), the most useful of which is accentuation of the pain by dorsiflexion of the foot (Bragard sign) or of the great toe (Sicard sign). The Lasègue maneuver with the healthy leg may evoke sciatic pain on the contralateral side), but usually of lesser degree (Fajersztajn sign). However, the presence of the “crossed straight-leg-raising sign” is highly indicative of a ruptured disc as the cause of sciatica (Hudgkins). With the patient standing, forward bending of the trunk will cause flexion of the knee on the affected side (Neri sign). Sciatica may be provoked by forced flexion of the head and neck, coughing, or pressure on both jugular veins, all of which increase the intraspinal pressure (Naffziger sign). Marked inconsistencies in response to these tests raise the suspicion of psychologic factors or of referred muscular pain.

An antalgic posture, referred to as sciatic scoliosis, is maintained by reflex contraction of the paraspinal muscles, which can be both seen and palpated. In walking, the knee is slightly flexed, and weight bearing on the painful leg is brief and cautious on the ball of the foot, giving a limp. It is particularly painful for the patient to go up and down stairs.

The signs of more severe spinal root compression are impairment of sensation, loss or diminution of tendon reflexes, and muscle weakness, as summarized in

Table 10-1.

In association with severe pelvic fractures, urethral rupture may occur at the prostatomembranous junction above the deep perineal pouch. The urine will extravasate into the true pelvis.

The worst and most serious urethral rupture is related to serious pelvic injuries where there is complete disruption of the puboprostatic ligaments. The prostate is dislocated superiorly not only by the ligamentous disruption but also by the extensive hematoma formed within the true pelvis. The diagnosis can be made by palpating the elevated prostate during a digital rectal examination.

A 25-year-old man visited his family physician because he had a “dragging feeling” in the left side of his scrotum. He was otherwise healthy and had no other symptoms. During examination, the physician palpated the left testis, which was normal, although he noted soft nodular swelling around the superior aspect of the testes and the epididymis. In his clinical notes, he described these findings as a “bag of worms” (Fig. 5.86). The bag of worms was a varicocele.

The venous drainage of the testis is via the pampiniform plexus of veins that runs within the spermatic cord. A varicocele is a collection of dilated veins that arise from the pampiniform plexus. In many ways, they are similar to varicose veins that develop in the legs. Typically, the patient complains of a dragging feeling in the scrotum and around the testis, which is usually worse toward the end of the day.

The family physician recommended surgical treatment, with a recommendation for surgery through an inguinal incision.

A simple surgical technique divides the skin around the inguinal ligament. The aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle is divided in the anterior abdominal wall to display the spermatic cord. Careful inspection of the spermatic cord reveals the veins, which are surgically ligated.

Another option is to embolize the varicocele.

An urgent surgical procedure was performed.

Burr holes were placed around the region of the hematoma and it was evacuated. The small branch of the middle meningeal artery was ligated and the patient spent a few days in the intensive care unit. Fortunately the patient made an uneventful recovery.

A 35-year-old man was involved in a fight and sustained a punch to the right orbit. He came to the emergency department with double vision.

The double vision was only in one plane.

Examination of the orbits revealed that when the patient was asked to look upward the right eye was unable to move superiorly when adducted. There was some limitation in general eye movement. Assessment of the lateral rectus muscle (abducent nerve [VI]), superior oblique muscle (trochlear nerve [IV]), and the rest of the eye muscles (oculomotor nerve [III]) was otherwise unremarkable.

The patient underwent a CT scan.

A CT scan of the facial bones demonstrated a fracture through the floor of the orbit (Fig. 8.293).

A careful review of this CT scan demonstrated that the inferior oblique muscle had been pulled inferiorly with the fragment of bone in the fracture. This produced a tethering effect, so when the patient was asked to gaze in the upward direction, the left eye was able to do so but the right eye was unable to because of the tethered inferior oblique muscle.

The patient underwent surgical exploration to elevate the small bony fragment and return the inferior oblique to its appropriate position. On follow-up the patient had no complications.

A 25-year-old man complained of significant swelling in front of his right ear before and around mealtimes. This swelling was associated with considerable pain, which was provoked by the ingestion of lemon sweets. On examination he had tenderness around the right parotid region and a hard nodule was demonstrated in the buccal mucosa adjacent to the right upper molar teeth.

A diagnosis of parotid duct calculus was made.

Asking the patient when the baby first moved and if she is currently experiencing movement of the fetus is important. Determining fetal age is key for consider-ations of viability. Gestational age may be estimated by noting fundal height, with the fundus approximating the umbilicus at 20 weeks and the costal margin at 40 weeks.

Treatment When molar pregnancy is diagnosed, the patient should be evaluated for the presence of associated medical complications, including preeclampsia, hyperthyroidism, electrolyte imbalance, and anemia. After the patient’s condition is stabilized, a decision must be made concerning the most appropriate method of evacuation.

Suction Curettage Suction curettage is the preferred method of evacuation, regardless of uterine size, for patients who desire to preserve fertility (32). It involves the following steps: 1.

Oxytocin infusion—This procedure is begun before the induction of anesthesia.

2.

Cervical dilation—As the cervix is being dilated, uterine bleeding often increases. Retained blood in the endometrial cavity may be expelled during cervical dilation. Active uterine bleeding should not deter the prompt completion of cervical dilation.

3.

Suction curettage—Within a few minutes of commencing suction curettage, uterine size may decrease dramatically, and the bleeding will be well controlled. The use of a 12-mm cannula is strongly advised to facilitate evacuation. If the uterus is larger than 14 weeks of gestation, one hand should be placed on top of the fundus, and the uterus should be massaged to stimulate uterine contraction and reduce the risk of perforation.

4.

Sharp curettage—When suction evacuation is believed to be complete, gentle sharp curettage is performed to remove any residual molar tissue.

Because trophoblast cells express RhD factor, patients who are Rh negative should receive Rh immune globulin at the time of evacuation.

(See also Chaps. 417–419) In pregnancy, the fetoplacental unit induces major metabolic changes, the purpose of which is to shunt glucose and amino acids to the fetus while the mother uses ketones and triglycerides to fuel her metabolic needs. These metabolic changes are accompanied by maternal insulin resistance caused in part by placental production of steroids, a growth hormone variant, and placental lactogen. Although pregnancy has been referred to as a state of “accelerated starvation,” it is better characterized as “accelerated ketosis.” In pregnancy, after an overnight fast, plasma glucose is lower by 0.8–1.1 mmol/L (15–20 mg/dL) than in the nonpregnant state. This difference is due to the use of glucose by the fetus. In early pregnancy, fasting may result in circulating glucose concentrations in the range of 2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) and may be associated with symptoms of hypoglycemia. In contrast to the decrease in maternal glucose concentration, plasma hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate levels rise to two to four times normal after a fast.

Pregnancy complicated by diabetes mellitus is associated with higher maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality rates. Preconception counseling and treatment are important for the diabetic patient contemplating pregnancy and can reduce the risk of congenital malformations and improve pregnancy outcome. Folate supplementation reduces the incidence of fetal neural tube defects, which occur with greater frequency in fetuses of diabetic mothers. In addition, optimizing glucose control during key periods of organogenesis reduces other congenital anomalies, including sacral agenesis, caudal dysplasia, renal agenesis, and ventricular septal defect.

Diabetogenicity of Pregnancy

Fig.

44.36 ). During the last half of pregnancy when hPL levels are highest, maternal energy metabolism shifts from an anabolic state in which nutrients are stored to a catabolic state sometimes described as accelerated starvation, in which maternal energy metabolism shifts toward fat utilization with sparing of glucose. As maternal use of glucose for energy decreases, lipolysis increases and fatty acids become major energy sources. Peripheral responsiveness to insulin decreases and pancreatic insulin secretion increases. Beta cell hyperplasia occurs in pregnancy. Although this does not usually lead to a clinical condition, pregnancy aggravates existing diabetes mellitus, and diabetes can develop for the first time in pregnancy. If the diabetes resolves spontaneously with delivery, the condition is referred to as gestational diabetes. Other hormones contributing to the diabetogenicity of pregnancy are estrogens and progestins, because both these hormones decrease insulin sensitivity.

Human pregnancy lasts an average of 40 weeks from the beginning of the last menstrual period (gestational age).

This corresponds to an average fetal age of 38 weeks. Par turition is the process whereby uterine contractions lead to childbirth. Labor consists of three stages: strong uterine contractions that force the fetus against the cervix, with dilation and thinning of the cervix (several hours); delivery of the fetus (<1 hour); and delivery of the placenta, along with contractions of the myometrium to halt bleeding (<10 minutes).

Control of parturition in humans is complex, and the exact mechanisms underlying its control are not well understood.

Venous return is initiated followed by arterial flow while monitoring systemic blood pressure. At normothermia, the flow required is approxi-mately 2.4 L/min/m2, but with hypothermia, oxygen consump-tion is reduced by 50% for every 10°C drop in temperature, and a flow of only 1 L/min/m2 is required at 18°C.

The distal lumen of the catheter, which is beyond the balloon, measures left atrial pressure (LAP) and, in the absence of mitral valvular disease, LAP approximates LVEDP. Pulmonary–capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) equals the LAP, which equals LVEDP and is normal at 8 to 12 mm Hg. Because the standard pulmonary artery catheter has an incorporated thermistor, thermodilution studies can be performed to determine cardiac output. This thermodilution method is performed by injecting cold 5% dextrose in water through the proximal port of the catheter, which cools the blood entering the right atrium. The change in temperature measured at the more distal thermistor (4 cm from the catheter tip) generates a curve proportional to cardiac output. Knowledge of the cardiac output is helpful in establishing cardiovascular diagnoses. For example, a patient with hypotension, low-to-normal wedge pressure, and a cardiac output of 3 L per minute is most likely hypovolemic. The same patient with a cardiac output of 8 L per minute is probably septic with resultant low systemic vascular resistance.

Pulmonary artery catheters are associated with a small but significant complication rate. The complications can be grouped into those occurring during venous cannulation or insertion, during maintenance and use, and those related to interpretation of hemodynamic data (210). The most common problems encountered during venous access are cannulation of the carotid or subclavian artery and introduction of a pneumothorax. Problems resulting from the catheter itself include dysrhythmias, sepsis, and disruption of the pulmonary artery. Pulmonary artery catheters (PAC) should be placed under the supervision of experienced personnel in a setting in which complications can be rapidly diagnosed and treated. Accessory equipment such as resuscitation equipment and an external pacing device must be immediately available. Ultrasound and ﬂuoroscopic equipment if available may aid in PAC placement (211).

The mainstays of therapy for type II respiratory failure are directed at reversing the underlying cause(s) of ventilatory failure. Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation with a tight-fitting facial or nasal mask, with avoidance of endotracheal intubation, often stabilizes these patients. This approach has been shown to be beneficial in treating patients with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; it has been tested less extensively in other kinds of respiratory failure but may be attempted nonetheless in the absence of contraindications (hemodynamic instability, inability to protect the airway, respiratory arrest).

ventilation may also be used to reverse regional atelectasis.

This form results from hypoperfusion of respiratory muscles in patients in shock. Normally, respiratory muscles consume <5% of total cardiac output and oxygen delivery. Patients in shock often experience respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema (e.g., in cardiogenic shock), lactic acidosis, and anemia. In this setting, up to 40% of cardiac output may be distributed to the respiratory muscles. Intubation and mechanical ventilation can allow redistribution of the cardiac output away from the respiratory muscles and back to vital organs while the shock is treated.

as the patient weakens over days, there is slight tachycardia, diaphoresis, restlessness, and tachypnea. Attempts to forestall intubation and positive-pressure ventilation by using negative-pressure cuirass-type devices have been unsatisfactory in our experience. Patients with oropharyngeal weakness require intubation even earlier so as to prevent aspiration, but full mechanical ventilation is not always necessary at the same time. Patients in these circumstances should obviously be admitted to an intensive care unit staffed by personnel skilled in maintaining ventilation and airway patency.

capacity of greater than 1.5 L. If a downward trend in these measurements is recognized and the vital capacity diminishes to below about 10 mL/kg, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are usually necessary (see further on). However, a fairly severe impairment of ventilation may occur before the first sign of dyspnea appears and before there is elevation of arterial carbon dioxide content. Incipient respiratory failure may be evident by tachypnea and a decrease in arterial oxygen tension (Po2 less than 85 mm Hg) reflecting pulmonary atelectasis. When respiratory failure arises gradually as the patient weakens

Measurement of maximal inspiratory force and expiratory vital capacity usually suffices for the bedside estimation of diaphragmatic strength and respiratory function. The trend of these measurements is a guide to the likelihood of respiratory failure. As had been observed in poliomyelitis, the strength of the neck muscles and trapezii, which share the same segmental innervation as the diaphragm, tends to parallel diaphragmatic power. A rough estimate of breathing capacity may be obtained by having the patient count quickly on one deep breath. The ability to reach 20 generally corresponds to a vital capacity of greater than

Pneumonia Pneumonia is defined as inﬂammation of the distal lung that includes terminal airways, alveolar spaces, and the interstitium. Pneumonia may have multiple causes, including viral and bacterial infections or aspiration. Aspiration pneumonia is usually the result of depressed awareness commonly associated with the use of drugs and alcohol or anesthesia. Viral pneumonias are caused by multiple infectious agents, including inﬂuenza A or B, parainﬂuenza virus, or respiratory syncytial virus. Most viral syndromes are spread by aerosolization associated with coughing, sneezing, and even conversation. Incubation is short, requiring only 1 to 3 days before the acute onset of fever, chills, headache, fatigue, and myalgias. Symptom intensity is directly related to intensity of the host febrile reaction. Pneumonia develops in only 1% of patients who have a viral syndrome, but mortality rates may reach 30% in immunocompromised individuals and the elderly. An additional risk is the development of secondary bacterial pneumonias after the initial viral insult. These infections are more common in elderly patients and may explain the high fatality in this group (8). Staphylococcal pneumonias, which often arise from a previous viral infection, are extremely lethal regardless of patient age. The best treatment for viral pneumonia is prevention by immunization. Treatment is supportive and consists mostly of administration of antipyretics and ﬂuids.

Bacterial pneumonia is classified as either community acquired or nosocomial, and in many cases the classification determines prognosis and antibiotic therapy. Risk factors that contribute to mortality are chronic cardiopulmonary diseases, alcoholism, diabetes, renal failure, malignancy, and malnutrition. Prognostic features associated with poor outcome include greater than two lobe involvement, respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths per minute on presentation, severe hypoxemia (<60 mm Hg on room air), hypoalbuminemia, and septicemia.

The physical examination may point to the potential causes (see Table 150-2). The physiologic stability of the patient may be abnormal with acute blood loss and acute hemolysis, manifesting as tachycardia, blood pressure changes, and, most ominously, an altered state of consciousness. The presence of jaundice suggests hemolysis. Petechiae and purpura indicate a coagulopathy. Hepatosplenomegaly and adenopathy suggest infiltrative disorders. Growth failure or poor weight gain suggests an anemia of chronic disease. An essential element of the physical examination is the investigation of the stool for the presence of occult blood.

A hemoglobin or hematocrit test indicates the severity of the anemia. Once anemia has been substantiated, the workup should include a complete blood count with differential, platelet count, indices, and reticulocyte count. Examination of the peripheral blood smear assesses the morphology of RBCs (Fig. 150-2), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets. All cell lines should be scrutinized to determine whether anemia is the result of a process limited to the erythroid line or a process that affects other marrow elements. Using data obtained from the indices and reticulocyte count, the workup can be organized on the basis of whether RBC production is adequate or inadequate and whether the cells are microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic (see Fig. 150-1).

An appropriate bone marrow response to anemia would be an elevated absolute reticulocyte number, suggestingincreased production and implying either hemolysis orblood loss. Anemia with a normal reticulocyte number suggests decreased or ineffective production for the degree ofanemia. Reticulocytopenia signifies an acute onset so thatthe marrow has not had adequate time to respond, thatreticulocytes are being destroyed in the marrow (antibodymediated), or that intrinsic bone marrow disease is present.The best indicators of the severity of hemolysis are the hemoglobin level and the elevation of the reticulocyte count. Biochemical evidence of hemolysis includes an increase inlevels of bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase and a decreasein haptoglobin.

LABORATORY STUDIES Blood Anemia is present in most cases, either alone or as part of bi-or pancytopenia; isolated neutropenia or thrombocytopenia is more unusual. Macrocytosis is common, and the smear may be dimorphic with a distinctive population of large red blood cells. Platelets are also large and lack granules. In functional studies, they may show marked abnormalities, and patients may have bleeding symptoms despite seemingly adequate numbers. Neutrophils are hypogranulated; have hyposegmented, ringed, or abnormally segmented nuclei; contain Döhle bodies; and may be functionally deficient. Circulating myeloblasts usually correlate with marrow blast numbers, and their quantity is important for classification and prognosis. The total white blood cell count (WBC) is usually normal or low, except in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. As in aplastic anemia, MDS can be associated with a clonal population of PNH cells. Genetic testing is commercially available for constitutional syndromes.

Bone Marrow The bone marrow is usually normal or hypercellular, but in about 20% of cases, it is sufficiently hypocellular to be confused with aplasia. No single characteristic feature of marrow morphology distinguishes MDS, but the following are commonly observed: dyserythropoietic changes (especially nuclear abnormalities) and ringed sideroblasts in the erythroid lineage; hypogranulation and hyposegmentation in granulocytic precursors, with an increase in myeloblasts; and megakaryocytes showing reduced numbers of or disorganized aGood, normal, –Y, del(5q), del (20q); poor, complex (≥3 abnormalities) or chromosome 7 abnormalities; intermediate, all other abnormalities. bCytopenias defined as hemoglobin <100 g/L, platelet count <100,000/μL, and absolute neutrophil count <1500/μL.

nuclei. Megaloblastic nuclei associated with defective hemoglobinization in the erythroid lineage are common. Prognosis strongly correlates with the proportion of marrow blasts. Cytogenetic analysis and fluorescent in situ hybridization can identify chromosomal abnormalities.

Congenital methemoglobinemia arises from globin mutations that stabilize iron in the ferric state (e.g., HbM Iwata [α87His→Tyr], Table 127-3) or from mutations that impair the enzymes that reduce met-hemoglobin to hemoglobin (e.g., methemoglobin reductase, NADP diaphorase). Acquired methemoglobinemia is caused by toxins that oxidize heme iron, notably nitrate and nitrite-containing compounds, including drugs commonly used in cardiology and anesthesiology.

DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH UNSTABLE HEMOGLOBINS, HIGH-AFFINITY HEMOGLOBINS, AND METHEMOGLOBINEMIA

Unstable hemoglobin variants should be suspected in patients with nonimmune hemolytic anemia, jaundice, splenomegaly, or premature biliary tract disease. Severe hemolysis usually presents during infancy as neonatal jaundice or anemia. Milder cases may present in adult life with anemia or only as unexplained reticulocytosis, hepatosplenomegaly, premature biliary tract disease, or leg ulcers. Because spontaneous mutation is common, family history of anemia may be absent. The peripheral blood smear often shows anisocytosis, abundant cells with punctate inclusions, and irregular shapes (i.e., poikilocytosis).

The two best tests for diagnosing unstable hemoglobins are the Heinz body preparation and the isopropanol or heat stability test. Many unstable Hb variants are electrophoretically silent. A normal electrophoresis does not rule out the diagnosis. Mass spectroscopy or direct gene analysis will provide a definitive diagnosis.

2023-11-29 14:12:14,671 query: A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department with complaints of nausea, vomiting, palpitations, and dizziness, which have lasted for the past 3 hours. He was diagnosed with heart failure 1 year ago. During his last visit to his primary care physician, he was doing well and the lab results were normal. He reports that he has been taking low-dose aspirin and digoxin regularly for 1 year, and verapamil was recently added to prevent his frequent migraine headaches. An electrocardiogram is performed urgently and shows paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with block. Suspecting digitalis toxicity, the emergency medicine physician sends blood to the lab for a serum digoxin level, which is 3.7 ng/mL (therapeutic range: 0.8–2 ng/mL). Which of the following mechanisms most likely explains the development of digitalis toxicity in this patient?

Vomiting is common in patients with digitalis overdose. Hyperkalemia may be caused by acute digitalis overdose or severe poisoning, whereas hypokalemia may be present in patients as a result of long-term diuretic treatment. (Digitalis does not cause hypokalemia.) A variety of cardiac rhythm disturbances may occur, including sinus bradycardia, AV block, atrial tachycardia with block, accelerated junctional rhythm, premature ventricular beats, bidirectional ventricular tachycardia, and other ventricular arrhythmias.

General supportive care should be provided. Atropine is often effective for bradycardia or AV block. The use of digoxin antibodies (see Chapter 13) has revolutionized the treatment of digoxin toxicity; they should be administered intravenously in the dosage indicated in the package insert. Symptoms usually improve within 30–60 minutes after antibody administration. Digoxin antibodies may also be tried in cases of poisoning by other cardiac glycosides (eg, digitoxin, oleander), although larger doses may be needed due to incomplete cross-reactivity.

Overdosage with ethanol and sedative-hypnotic drugs (eg, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, γ-hydroxybutyrate [GHB], carisoprodol [Soma]; see Chapters 22 and 23) occurs frequently because of their common availability and use.

Patients with ethanol or other sedative-hypnotic overdose may be euphoric and rowdy (“drunk”) or in a state of stupor or coma (“dead drunk”). Comatose patients often have depressed respiratory drive. Depression of protective airway reflexes may result in pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents, leading to pneumonia. Hypothermia may be present because of environmental exposure and depressed shivering. Ethanol blood levels greater than 300 mg/dL usually cause deep coma, but regular users are often tolerant to the effects of ethanol and may be ambulatory despite even higher levels. Patients with GHB overdose are often deeply comatose for 3–4 hours and then awaken fully in a matter of minutes.

In contrast, the calcium-blocking drugs appear to have no role in the treatment of patients with heart failure. Their depressant effects on the heart may worsen heart failure. On the other hand, slowing of heart rate with ivabradine (an If blocker, see Chapter 12) may be of benefit.

Digoxin is indicated in patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation. It is usually given only when diuretics and ACE inhibitors have failed to control symptoms. Only about 50% of patients with normal sinus rhythm (usually those with documented systolic dysfunction) will have relief of heart failure from digitalis. If the decision is made to use a cardiac glycoside, digoxin is the one chosen in most cases (and the only one available in the USA). When symptoms are mild, slow loading (digitalization) with 0.125–0.25 mg/d is safer and just as effective as the rapid method (0.5–0.75 mg every 8 hours for three doses, followed by 0.125–0.25 mg/d).

Determining the optimal level of digitalis effect may be difficult. Unfortunately, toxic effects may occur before therapeutic effects are detected. Measurement of plasma digoxin levels is useful in patients who appear unusually resistant or sensitive; a level of 1 ng/mL or less is appropriate; higher levels may be required in patients with atrial fibrillation.

Because it has a moderate but persistent positive inotropic effect, digitalis can, in theory, reverse all the signs and symptoms of heart failure. Although the net effect of the drug on mortality is mixed, it reduces hospitalization and deaths from progressive heart failure at the expense of an increase in sudden death. It is important to note that the mortality rate is reduced in patients with serum digoxin concentrations of less than 0.9 ng/mL but increased in those with digoxin levels greater than 1.5 ng/mL.

Once the extent of the disease has been assessed, treatment can be planned.

In the clinic

The first case of esophageal rupture was described by Herman Boerhaave in 1724. This case was fatal, but early diagnosis has increased the survival rate up to 65%. If the disease is left untreated, mortality is 100%.

Typically, the rupture occurs in the lower third of the esophagus with a sudden rise in intraluminal esophageal pressure produced by vomiting secondary to an uncoordination and failure of the cricopharyngeus muscle to relax. Because the tears typically occur on the left, they are often associated with a large left pleural effusion that contains the gastric contents. In some patients, subcutaneous emphysema may be demonstrated.

Treatment is optimal with urgent surgical repair.

A 65-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe central chest pain that radiated to the neck and predominantly to the left arm. He was overweight and a known heavy smoker.

On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B).

This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly.

A 62-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe interscapular pain. His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it was noted he was 6’ 9” and had undergone previous eye surgery for dislocating lenses.

On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis.

The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made.

Aortic dissection is an uncommon disorder in which a small tear occurs within the aortic wall (eFig. 3.120). The aortic wall contains three layers, an intima, a media, and an adventitia. A tear in the intima extends into the media and peels it away, forming a channel within the wall of the vessel. Usually the blood reenters the main vessel wall distal to its point of entry.

The myocardial infarction

Aortic dissection may extend retrogradely to involve the coronary sinus of the right coronary artery. Unfortunately, in this patient’s case the right coronary artery became occluded as the dissection passed into the origin. In normal individuals the right coronary artery supplies the anterior inferior aspect of the myocardium, and this is evident as an anterior myocardial infarct on an ECG.

The ischemic left leg

The two channels within the aorta have extended throughout the length of the aorta into the right iliac system and to the level of the right femoral artery. Although blood flows through these structures it often causes reduced blood flow. Hence the reduced blood flow into the left lower limb renders it ischemic.

The patient became acidotic.

A 33-year-old man was playing cricket for his local Sunday team. As the new bowler pitched the ball short, it bounced higher than he anticipated and hit him on the side of his head. He immediately fell to the ground unconscious, but after about 30 seconds he was helped to his feet and felt otherwise well. It was noted he had some bruising around his temple. He decided not to continue playing and went to watch the match from the side. Over the next hour he became extremely sleepy and was eventually unrousable. He was rushed to hospital.

When he was admitted to hospital, the patient’s breathing was shallow and irregular and it was necessary to intubate him. A skull radiograph demonstrated a fracture in the region of the pterion. No other abnormality was demonstrated other than minor soft tissue bruising over the left temporal fossa.

A CT scan was performed.

The CT scan demonstrated a lentiform area of high density within the left cranial fossa.

A diagnosis of extradural hemorrhage was made.

Fractures in the region of the pterion are extremely dangerous. A division of the middle meningeal artery passes deep to this structure and is subject to laceration and disruption, especially in conjunction with a skull injury in this region. In this case the middle meningeal artery was torn and started to bleed, producing a large extradural clot.

The patient’s blood pressure began to increase.

Within the skull there is a fixed volume and clearly what goes in must come out (e.g., blood, cerebrospinal fluid). If there is a space-occupying lesion, such as an extradural hematoma, there is no space into which it can decompress. As the lesion expands, the brain becomes compressed and the intracranial pressure increases. This pressure compresses vessels, so lowering the cerebral perfusion pressure. To combat this the homeostatic mechanisms of the body increase the blood pressure to overcome the increase in intracerebral pressure. Unfortunately, the increase in intracranial pressure is compounded by the cerebral edema that occurs at and after the initial insult.

An urgent surgical procedure was performed.

document (3) 

An urgent surgical procedure was performed.

Burr holes were placed around the region of the hematoma and it was evacuated. The small branch of the middle meningeal artery was ligated and the patient spent a few days in the intensive care unit. Fortunately the patient made an uneventful recovery.

A 35-year-old man was involved in a fight and sustained a punch to the right orbit. He came to the emergency department with double vision.

The double vision was only in one plane.

Examination of the orbits revealed that when the patient was asked to look upward the right eye was unable to move superiorly when adducted. There was some limitation in general eye movement. Assessment of the lateral rectus muscle (abducent nerve [VI]), superior oblique muscle (trochlear nerve [IV]), and the rest of the eye muscles (oculomotor nerve [III]) was otherwise unremarkable.

The patient underwent a CT scan.

A CT scan of the facial bones demonstrated a fracture through the floor of the orbit (Fig. 8.293).

A careful review of this CT scan demonstrated that the inferior oblique muscle had been pulled inferiorly with the fragment of bone in the fracture. This produced a tethering effect, so when the patient was asked to gaze in the upward direction, the left eye was able to do so but the right eye was unable to because of the tethered inferior oblique muscle.

The patient underwent surgical exploration to elevate the small bony fragment and return the inferior oblique to its appropriate position. On follow-up the patient had no complications.

A 25-year-old man complained of significant swelling in front of his right ear before and around mealtimes. This swelling was associated with considerable pain, which was provoked by the ingestion of lemon sweets. On examination he had tenderness around the right parotid region and a hard nodule was demonstrated in the buccal mucosa adjacent to the right upper molar teeth.

A diagnosis of parotid duct calculus was made.

Sedentary Lifestyle Physical inactivity is a predictor of CVD events and the related risk of death. Many components of the metabolic syndrome are associated with a sedentary lifestyle, including increased adipose tissue (predominantly central), reduced HDL cholesterol, and increased triglycerides, blood pressure, and glucose in genetically susceptible persons. Compared with individuals who watch television or videos or use the computer <1 h daily, those who do so for >4 h daily have a twofold increased risk of the metabolic syndrome.

This form of minor head injury had in the past referred to an immediate and transient loss of consciousness that was associated with a short period of amnesia. Many patients, however, do not lose consciousness after a minor head injury but instead are dazed or confused, or feel stunned or “star struck,” and the term concussion is now applied to all such cognitive and perceptual changes experienced after a blow to the head. Severe concussion may precipitate a brief convulsion or autonomic signs such as facial pallor, bradycardia, faintness with mild hypotension, or sluggish pupillary reaction, but most patients quickly return to a neurologically normal state.

The mechanics of a typical concussion involve sudden deceleration of the head when hitting a blunt stationary object. This creates an anterior-posterior movement of the brain within the skull due to inertia and rotation of the cerebral hemispheres on the fulcrum of the relatively fixed upper brainstem. Loss of consciousness in concussion is believed to result from a transient electrophysiologic dysfunction of the reticular activating system in the upper midbrain that is at the site of rotation (Chap. 328). The transmission of a wave of kinetic energy throughout the brain is an alternative explanation for the disruption in consciousness.

Gross and light-microscopic changes in the brain are usually absent following concussion, but biochemical and ultrastructural changes, such as mitochondrial ATP depletion and local disruption of the blood-brain barrier, may be transient abnormalities. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are usually normal; however, a small number of patients will be found to have a skull fracture, an intracranial hemorrhage, or a brain contusion.

Concussion describes reversible altered brain function, with or without loss of consciousness, from head injury. The characteristic transient neurologic dysfunction includes loss of consciousness, temporary respiratory arrest, and loss of reflexes. Neurologic recovery is the norm, although amnesia for the event persists. The pathogenesis of the sudden disruption of nervous activity is unknown. Repeated episodes of concussion can result in persistent and profound neurologic deficits including cognitive impairment, parkinsonism, and others, and later development of neurodegenerative processes. Initially described in boxers (dementia pugilistica), it is now recognized to occur in a wider range of settings, such as in athletes participating in contact sports. This syndrome is termed chronic traumatic encephalopathy and is characterized by accumulation of tangles in cerebral cortex and other brain regions (see the “ ” section later in the chapter).

CNS trauma often directly disrupts vessel walls, leading to hemorrhage (

Table 23.1 ). Depending on the affected vessel, the hemorrhage may be epidural, subdural, subarachnoid, or intraparenchymal (

Fig. 23.13A ), occurring alone or in combination. Subarachnoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhages most often occur at sites of contusions and lacerations.

Dural vessels—especially the middle meningeal artery— are vulnerable to traumatic injury. In infants, traumatic displacement of the easily deformable skull may tear a vessel, even in the absence of a skull fracture. In children and adults, by contrast, tears involving dural vessels almost always stem from skull fractures. Once a vessel tears, blood accumulates under arterial pressure and dissects the tightly applied dura away from the inner skull surface (see

or more commonly, a hard surface that arrests the motion of a moving head, that is, concussion does not occur if the head remains entirely stationary. This sudden deceleration or acceleration of the cranium is the mechanism of most civilian head injuries, and they are notable in two respects: they may induce at least a temporary loss of consciousness, and the brain may suffer gross damage even though the skull is not penetrated, that is, contusion, laceration, hemorrhage, and swelling. In the past few decades, the definition of concussion has been expanded to include any neurological phenomenon that

A careful neurologic examination is an essential first step in the evaluation. In most cases, patients with an abnormal examination or a history of recent-onset headache should be evaluated by a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. As an initial screening procedure for intracranial pathology in this setting, CT and MRI methods appear to be equally sensitive. In some circumstances, a lumbar puncture (LP) is also required, unless a benign etiology can be otherwise established. A general evaluation of acute headache might include cranial arteries by palpation; cervical spine by

Pain induced by bending, lifting, cough

Pain associated with local tenderness, e.g., region of temporal artery the effect of passive movement of the head and by imaging; the investigation of cardiovascular and renal status by blood pressure monitoring and urine examination; and eyes by funduscopy, intraocular pressure measurement, and refraction.

The psychological state of the patient should also be evaluated because a relationship exists between head pain and depression. This is intended to identify comorbidity rather than provide an explanation for the headache, because troublesome headache is seldom simply caused by mood change. Although it is notable that medicines with antidepressant actions are also effective in the prophylactic treatment of both tension-type headache and migraine, each symptom must be treated optimally.

Underlying recurrent headache disorders may be activated by pain that follows otologic or endodontic surgical procedures. Thus, pain about the head as the result of diseased tissue or trauma may reawaken an otherwise quiescent migraine syndrome. Treatment of the headache is largely ineffective until the cause of the primary problem is addressed.

Serious underlying conditions that are associated with headache are described below. Brain tumor is a rare cause of headache and even less commonly a cause of severe pain. The vast majority of patients presenting with severe headache have a benign cause.

The management of secondary headache focuses on diagnosis and treatment of the underlying condition.

Acute, severe headache with stiff neck and fever suggests meningitis. LP is mandatory. Often there is striking accentuation of pain with eye movement. Meningitis can be easily mistaken for migraine in that the cardinal symptoms of pounding headache, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting are frequently present, perhaps reflecting the underlying biology of some of the patients.

Imaging the brain and spinal cord is accomplished using CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CT is quick and accessible for emergency purposes. MRI provides fine detail and, with different sequences, permits detection of posterior fossa lesions, subtle cerebral abnormalities, vascular anomalies, low-grade tumors, and ischemic changes. For a child with a head injury or sudden headache, cranial CT is the study of choice because it can rapidly reveal intracranial hemorrhage or other large lesions. For a child with new-onset complex partial seizures, MRI is the study of choice, because an area of focal cortical dysplasia or other subtle lesions might not be apparent on CT. MRI also provides excellent views of the spinal cord. Cranial ultrasonography is a noninvasive bedside procedure used to visualize the brain and ventricles of infants and young children with open fontanelles.

Headache is a common symptom among children and adolescents. Headaches can be a primary problem (migraines, tension-type headaches) or secondary to another condition. Secondary headaches are most often associated with minor illnesses such as viral upper respiratory infections or sinusitis, but may be the first symptom of serious conditions (meningitis, brain tumors), so a systematic approach is necessary.

The temporal pattern of the headache must be clarified. Each pattern (acute, recurrent-episodic, chronic-progressive, chronic-nonprogressive) has its own differential diagnosis (Table 180-1).

Tension-type headaches are the most common recurrent pattern of primary headaches in children and adolescents. They are generally mild and lack associated symptoms, so are not typically disruptive to patients’ lifestyle or activities. The pain is global and squeezing or pressing in character, but can last for hours or days. There is no associated nausea, vomiting, phonophobia, or photophobia. Headaches can be related to environmental stresses or symptomatic of underlying psychiatric illnesses, such as anxiety or depression.

Suspicion of this tumor is occasioned by intermittent, severe bifrontal–bioccipital headaches, sometimes modified by posture (“ball valve” obstruction) or with crises of headache and obtundation, incontinence, unsteadiness of gait, bilateral paresthesias, dim vision, and weakness of the legs, with sudden falls but no loss of consciousness (“drop attacks”). Stooping may result in an increase or onset of headache and loss of balance. However, this intermittent obstructive syndrome has been infrequent in our experience. More often the patient has no headache and presents with the symptoms comparable to those of normal-pressure hydrocephalus or, as frequently, the tumor is found incidentally on CT or MRI. On CT and MRI, the lesion density depends on the hydration state of the mucopolysaccharides. These lesions do not restrict diffusion or enhance with contrast. Subtle behavioral changes are common and a few patients, as emphasized by Lobosky and colleagues, experience mild confusion and changes in personality that may reach the extreme of psychotic behavior. We have no experience with this constellation and find it difficult to understand from the location of the lesion or from hydrocephalus; in our experience, chronic headache or gait difficulty is usually present.

The treatment for many years has been surgical excision, which carries some risk, far less than in the past, but satisfactory results have also been obtained by ventriculoperitoneal shunting of the CSF, leaving the cyst untouched. Decompression of the cyst by aspiration under stereotactic control has also become a popular procedure.

Other tumors found in the third ventricle and giving rise mainly to obstructive symptoms are craniopharyngiomas (see later), papillomas of the choroid plexus, and ependymomas (discussed earlier).

Migraine with Brainstem Aura (Basilar Migraine)

An uncommon form of the migraine syndrome with prominent premonitory brainstem symptoms was described by Bickerstaff. These patients, usually children with a family history of migraine, first develop visual phenomena like those of typical migraine except that they occupy much or the whole of both visual fields (temporary cortical blindness may occur). There may be associated vertigo, staggering, incoordination of the limbs, dysarthria, and tingling in both hands and feet, and sometimes around both sides of the mouth but curiously, rarely is there paralysis. These symptoms last 10 to 30 min and are followed by headache, which is usually occipital. Some patients, at the stage when the headache would have been likely to begin, may faint, and others become confused or stuporous, a state that may persist for several hours or longer. Exceptionally, there is an alarming period of coma or quadriplegia. The symptoms closely resemble those caused by ischemia in the territory of the basilar-posterior cerebral arteries—hence the name basilar, or vertebrobasilar migraine. Subsequent studies have indicated that basilar migraine, although more common in children and adolescents, affects men and women more or less equally over a wide age range, and that the condition is not always benign and transient because of rare instances with residual deficits.

The initial attack is not easily identifiable as a benign condition and various forms of imaging are reasonably performed in order to exclude basilar artery and upper brainstem disease. The issue of risk of causing stroke from the administration of intrarterial contrast is often raised and is unresolved. With recurrent similar attacks, the diagnosis becomes clearer and the use of imaging becomes less necessary.

Episodes of cyclic vomiting or periodic recurrent abdominal pain have been linked to migraine as a result of the frequent co-occurrence of these symptoms with headache or typical migraine at other times. Pallor, lethargy, and mild headache are common. This episodic disorder seems to be a problem almost exclusively of children. The results of diagnostic investigation are normal but one cannot be faulted for pursuing some form of testing with the initial occurrence of the syndrome.

2023-11-29 14:12:17,900 query: A 22-year-old woman from a rural area who recently discovered she was pregnant is referred for a cardiology consultation due to cyanosis, dyspnea, and a cardiac murmur revealed at the initial prenatal visit. She is gravida 1, para 0 with an estimated gestational age of 19 weeks. She says that the murmur was found in her childhood, and the doctor at that time placed her under observation only. However, she has been lost to follow-up and has not had proper follow up in years. Currently, she complains of dizziness and occasional dyspnea on exertion which has gradually increased during her pregnancy. Prior to her pregnancy, she did not have any symptoms. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 125/60 mm Hg, heart rate 81/min, respiratory rate 13/min, and temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F). Her examination is significant for acrocyanosis and a fixed splitting of S2 and grade 3/6 midsystolic murmur best heard over the left upper sternal border.

Changes in cardiac function become apparent during the irst 8 weeks of pregnancy (Hibbard, 2014). Cardiac output is increased as early as the ifth week and reflects a reduced systemic vascular resistance and an increased heart rate. Compared with prepregnancy measurements, brachial systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and central systolic blood pressure are all signiicantly lower 6 to 7 weeks from the last menstrual period (Mahendru, 2012). he resting pulse rate rises approximately 10 beats/min during pregnancy. Nelson and associates (2015) found that for both normal and overweight women, heart rate increased signiicantly between 12 and 16 weeks' and between 32 and 36 weeks' gestation. Between weeks 10 and 20, plasma volume expansion begins, and preload rises. his augmented preload results in signiicantly larger left atrial volumes and ejection fractions (Cong, 2015).

Ventricular performance during pregnancy is inluenced by both the decrease in systemic vascular resistance and changes in pulsatile arterial low. Multiple factors contribute to this overall altered hemodynamic function, which allows the physiological demands of the fetus to be met while maintaining maternal cardiovascular integrity (Hibbard, 2014). hese changes during the last half of pregnancy and efects of maternal posture are summarized in Figure 4-7.

As the diaphragm becomes progressively elevated, the heart is displaced to the left and upward and is rotated on its long axis. As a result, the apex is moved somewhat laterally from its usual position and produces a larger cardiac silhouette in chest radiographs. Furthermore, gravidas normally have some degree of benign pericardial efusion, which may enlarge the

FIGURE 4-7 Left ventricular stroke volume across pregnancy compared with 12-week postpartum (nonpregnant) values for normal-weight women in the supine and lateral positions. (Data from Nelson, 201o5.) cardiac silhouette (Enein, 1987). These factors make it dii cult to precisely identiy moderate degrees of cardiomegaly by simple radiographic studies.

document (1) 

During scanning, because of theoretical temperature elevation in tissues exposed to pulsed Doppler beam, this modality is applied only when needed for additional diagnostic purposes. M-mode should be used to document cardiac activity and measure the rate (Lane, 2013). Finding of an IUP and cardiac activity lowers subsequent miscarriage rates (Siddiqi, 1988).

In addition to the diagnostic parameters of Table 18-3, other softer sonographic markers may portend early pregnancy failure. Values for yolk sac diameters (measured inner-to-inner ring) for each gestational week in normal pregnancy have been established. Yolk sac diameters ::6 mm in pregnancies < 10 weeks' gestation are suspicious for pregnancy failure (Berdahl, 2010; Lindsay, 1992). The fetal heart rate in the irst trimester rises from 110 to 130 beats per minute (bpm) at 6 weeks' gestation to 160 to 170 bpm at 8 weeks (Achiron, 1991; Rauch, 2009). A slower heart rate is unfavorable, especially those <85 bpm (Laboda, 1989; Stefos, 1998). Even with cardiac activity, fetuses with a small MSD may presage embryonic loss. Speciically, a diference <5 mm between the MSD and CRL values raises concern (Bromley, 1991; Dickey, 1992). Last, subchorionic hematoma, that is, blood collected between the chorion and uterine wall, often accompanies threatened miscarriage. Studies are contradictory as to its association with ultimate pregnancy loss (Pedersen, 1990; Stabile, 1989; Tuuli, 2011). Bennett and associates (1996) noted that miscarriage risk correlated with larger hematoma size, older maternal age, and bleeding at a gestational age :;8 weeks.

With rapid confirmation of embryonic or fetal death, surgicalior medical evacuation or expectant observation is an option. As with induced abortion, nonsurgical options balance their noninvasiveness against heavier procedural bleeding, longer completion times, and lower success rates. Of options, expectant care underperforms medical or surgical options, and failure rates range from 15 to 50 percent (Luise, 2002; Trinder, 2006; Zhang, 2005). Also, weeks may pass between pregnancy failure diagnosis and actual spontaneous miscarriage.

In those instances when a diagnosis of labor cannot be established with certainty, observation for a longer period is often wise. Women who present to Parkland Hospital for labor 24°/7 ,. .

symptoms at weeks gestatIon or greater are routmely evaluated in a labor triage unit contiguous to our labor and delivery unit. All women in the triage area are evaluated by nurse practitioners and certiied nurse midwives using written protocols. Women with uncomplicated pregnancies with intact membranes and cervical dilation < 4 cm receive continuous external fetal monitoring for up to 2 hours. Women diagnosed with labor by either cervical change or persistent uterine contractions are admitted. After review by a physician, women without cervical change or with abatement of contractions return home with a diagnosis of false labor. In a recent study, a total of 3949 women with uncomplicated pregnancies between and 416r weeks' gestation were diagnosed with false labor. The mean inteval from hospital discharge to when they again presented was 4.9 days (Nelson, 2017). Within this protocol, hospital discharge with false labor at term was not associated with higher rates of adverse neonatal outcomes or cesarean delivery. he American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2016a) has endorsed hospital-based obstetrical triage units.

Maternal blood pressure, temperature, pulse, and respiratory rate are recorded. Fetal heart rate is evaluated using a portable Doppler device, sonography, or fetoscope. The pregnancy record is promptly reviewed to identiY complications. Problems identiied or anticipated during prenatal care should be displayed prominently in the pregnancy record. Most often, unless there has been bleeding in excess of bloody show, a cervical examination is performed. he gloved index and second ingers are introduced into the vagina while avoiding the anal region.

During prenatal care, the woman is instructed to be aware of luid leakage from the vagina and to report such an event promptly. Rupture of the membranes is signiicant for three reasons. First, if the presenting part is not ixed in the pelvis, the umbilical cord can prolapse and be compressed. Second, labor is likely to begin soon if the pregnancy is at or near term.

he systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels of 140/90 mm Hg have been arbitrarily used since the 1950s to define "hypertension" in nonpregnant individuals. However, these levels were selected by insurance companies to characterize a group of middle-aged men. It seems more realistic to deine normalrange blood pressures that fall between an upper and lower limit for a particular population-such as young, healthy, pregnant women.

By term, it is substantively higher and in the 75th percentile, but she is still considered "normotensive." 25th percentile until 32 weeks. These begin to rise in patient B, who by term has substantively higher blood pressures. However, her pressures are still < 140/90 mm Hg, and thus she is considered to be "normotensive." We use the term delta hypertension to describe this rather acute rise in blood pressure. Some of these women will go on to have obvious preeclampsia, and some even develop eclamptic seizures or HELLP (hemolysis, devatedliver enzyme levels, low 2latelet count) syndrome while still normotensive.

A 62-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe interscapular pain. His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it was noted he was 6’ 9” and had undergone previous eye surgery for dislocating lenses.

On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis.

The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made.

Aortic dissection is an uncommon disorder in which a small tear occurs within the aortic wall (eFig. 3.120). The aortic wall contains three layers, an intima, a media, and an adventitia. A tear in the intima extends into the media and peels it away, forming a channel within the wall of the vessel. Usually the blood reenters the main vessel wall distal to its point of entry.

The myocardial infarction

Aortic dissection may extend retrogradely to involve the coronary sinus of the right coronary artery. Unfortunately, in this patient’s case the right coronary artery became occluded as the dissection passed into the origin. In normal individuals the right coronary artery supplies the anterior inferior aspect of the myocardium, and this is evident as an anterior myocardial infarct on an ECG.

The ischemic left leg

The two channels within the aorta have extended throughout the length of the aorta into the right iliac system and to the level of the right femoral artery. Although blood flows through these structures it often causes reduced blood flow. Hence the reduced blood flow into the left lower limb renders it ischemic.

The patient became acidotic.

In association with severe pelvic fractures, urethral rupture may occur at the prostatomembranous junction above the deep perineal pouch. The urine will extravasate into the true pelvis.

The worst and most serious urethral rupture is related to serious pelvic injuries where there is complete disruption of the puboprostatic ligaments. The prostate is dislocated superiorly not only by the ligamentous disruption but also by the extensive hematoma formed within the true pelvis. The diagnosis can be made by palpating the elevated prostate during a digital rectal examination.

A 25-year-old man visited his family physician because he had a “dragging feeling” in the left side of his scrotum. He was otherwise healthy and had no other symptoms. During examination, the physician palpated the left testis, which was normal, although he noted soft nodular swelling around the superior aspect of the testes and the epididymis. In his clinical notes, he described these findings as a “bag of worms” (Fig. 5.86). The bag of worms was a varicocele.

The venous drainage of the testis is via the pampiniform plexus of veins that runs within the spermatic cord. A varicocele is a collection of dilated veins that arise from the pampiniform plexus. In many ways, they are similar to varicose veins that develop in the legs. Typically, the patient complains of a dragging feeling in the scrotum and around the testis, which is usually worse toward the end of the day.

The family physician recommended surgical treatment, with a recommendation for surgery through an inguinal incision.

A simple surgical technique divides the skin around the inguinal ligament. The aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle is divided in the anterior abdominal wall to display the spermatic cord. Careful inspection of the spermatic cord reveals the veins, which are surgically ligated.

Another option is to embolize the varicocele.

An urgent surgical procedure was performed.

Burr holes were placed around the region of the hematoma and it was evacuated. The small branch of the middle meningeal artery was ligated and the patient spent a few days in the intensive care unit. Fortunately the patient made an uneventful recovery.

A 35-year-old man was involved in a fight and sustained a punch to the right orbit. He came to the emergency department with double vision.

The double vision was only in one plane.

Examination of the orbits revealed that when the patient was asked to look upward the right eye was unable to move superiorly when adducted. There was some limitation in general eye movement. Assessment of the lateral rectus muscle (abducent nerve [VI]), superior oblique muscle (trochlear nerve [IV]), and the rest of the eye muscles (oculomotor nerve [III]) was otherwise unremarkable.

The patient underwent a CT scan.

A CT scan of the facial bones demonstrated a fracture through the floor of the orbit (Fig. 8.293).

A careful review of this CT scan demonstrated that the inferior oblique muscle had been pulled inferiorly with the fragment of bone in the fracture. This produced a tethering effect, so when the patient was asked to gaze in the upward direction, the left eye was able to do so but the right eye was unable to because of the tethered inferior oblique muscle.

The patient underwent surgical exploration to elevate the small bony fragment and return the inferior oblique to its appropriate position. On follow-up the patient had no complications.

A 25-year-old man complained of significant swelling in front of his right ear before and around mealtimes. This swelling was associated with considerable pain, which was provoked by the ingestion of lemon sweets. On examination he had tenderness around the right parotid region and a hard nodule was demonstrated in the buccal mucosa adjacent to the right upper molar teeth.

A diagnosis of parotid duct calculus was made.

Consider a CXR for suspected perforation or pulmonary pathology. AXR may be useful for obstruction, but CT is more sensitive and specific. CT is used to diagnose appendicitis, diverticulitis, abscess, renal stones, AAA, obstruction, and other pathology. Ultrasound is the best tool for diagnosing gallstones and gynecologic pathology. Bedside ultrasound (FAST and aortic views) can diagnose hemoperitoneum and AAA in unstable patients.

Hemodynamically unstable patients must have emergent surgical management.

In stable patients, expectant management may include NPO status, NG tube placement, IV ﬂuids, placement of a Foley catheter (to monitor urine output and ﬂuid status), and vital sign monitoring with serial abdominal exams and serial labs.

Give broad-spectrum antibiotics to all patients with perforation or signs of sepsis. Antibiotics may also be indicated for patients with infectious processes such as cholecystitis, diverticulitis, and pyelonephritis.

Type and cross all unstable patients.

The inciting event is obstruction of the appendiceal lumen with subsequent inﬂammation and infection. Rising intraluminal pressure leads to vascular compromise of the appendix, ischemia, necrosis, and possible perforation. Etiologies include hypertrophied lymphoid tissue (55–65%), fecalith (35%), foreign body, tumor (e.g., carcinoid tumor), and parasites. Incidence peaks in the early teens (most patients are between 10 and 30 years of age), and the male-to-female ratio is 2:1.

Presents with dull periumbilical pain lasting 1–12 hours that leads to sharp RLQ pain at McBurney’s point.

Also presents with nausea, vomiting, anorexia (“hamburger sign”), and low-grade fever.

the shelving edge of the inguinal ligament. At the pubic tubercle, this suture is tied to the tail of the original stitch. The next suture begins at the internal inguinal ring, and it continues medially, apposing the aponeuroses of the internal oblique and transversus abdominis to the external oblique aponeurotic fibers. At the pubic tubercle, the suture doubles back through the same structures lat-erally towards the tightened internal ring.McVay Repair The McVay repair addresses both inguinal and femoral ring defects.

Initial management includes RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation). Analgesics, antihistamines, antibiotics, and tetanus prophylaxis should be administered if indicated. Early debridement or surgical excision of the wound without closure delays healing. Routine use of antibiotics or dapsone is unnecessary. Patients should be monitored closely for signs of hemolysis, renal failure, and other systemic complications.

Widow Spider Bites The black widow spider, common in the southeastern United States, measures ≤1 cm in body length and 5 cm in leg span and is shiny black with a red hourglass marking on the ventral abdomen. Other dangerous Latrodectus species occur elsewhere in temperate and subtropical parts of the world. The bites of the female widow spiders are notorious for their potent neurotoxins.

This creates an anterior and posterior hernia sac, the latter of which is often filled with epiphrenic and retroperitoneal fat. These obser-vations point to the conclusion that the development of a hiatal hernia is an age-related phenomenon secondary to repetitive upward stretching of the phrenoesophageal membrane.Clinical ManifestationsThe clinical presentation of a giant hiatal (paraesophageal) her-nia differs from that of a sliding hernia.

In one study, an international coopera-tive organization performed over 1033 hernia repairs on 926 patients, and their impact was measured in disability adjusted life years (DALYs).

in the elderly; some of these drugs are listed in Table 60–2. The greatest changes are in phase I reactions, ie, those carried out by microsomal P450 systems. There are much smaller changes in the ability of the liver to carry out conjugation (phase II) reactions (see Chapter 4). Some of these changes may be caused by decreased liver blood flow (Table 60–1), an important variable in the clearance of drugs that have a high hepatic extraction ratio. In addition, there is a decline with age of the liver’s ability to recover from injury, eg, that caused by alcohol or viral hepatitis. Therefore, a history of recent liver disease in an older person should lead to caution in dosing with drugs that are cleared primarily by the liver, even after apparently complete recovery from the hepatic insult. Finally, malnutrition and diseases that affect hepatic function—eg, heart failure—are more common in the elderly. Heart failure may dramatically alter the ability of the liver to metabolize drugs by reducing hepatic blood flow. Similarly, severe nutritional deficiencies, which occur more often in old age, may impair hepatic function.

Probably the first to describe this acquired type of hepatocerebral degeneration was van Woerkom, whose report appeared only 2 years after Wilson’s original description of the familial form. A full account of the cases reported since that time as well as the extensive experience of our colleagues with this disorder is contained in the article by Victor, Adams and Cole.

The first symptom may be a tremor of the outstretched arms, fleeting arrhythmic twitches of the face and limbs (resembling either myoclonus or chorea), or a mild unsteadiness of gait with action tremor. As the condition evolves over months or years, a characteristic dysarthria, ataxia, wide-based, unsteady gait, and choreoathetosis, mainly of the face, neck, and shoulders, are joined in a syndrome. Mental function is slowly altered, taking the form of a dementia with a seeming lack of concern about the illness. A coarse, rhythmic tremor of the arms appearing with certain sustained postures, corticospinal tract signs (“hepatic paraplegia”), and diffuse EEG abnormalities complete the clinical picture. Other less-frequent signs are rigidity, grasp reflexes, tremor in repose, nystagmus, asterixis, and action or intention myoclonus. In essence, each of the neurologic abnormalities observed in patients with acute hepatic encephalopathy are also part of chronic hepatocerebral degeneration, the only difference being that the abnormalities are evanescent in the former and irreversible and progressive in the latter.

This syndrome of hepatic encephalopathy is remarkably diverse in its course and evolution. It usually appears over a period of days to weeks and may terminate fatally; or, with appropriate treatment, the symptoms may regress and then fluctuate in severity for several weeks or months. Persistent hepatic coma of the latter type proves fatal in about half of patients (Levy et al). In many patients, the syndrome is relatively mild and does not evolve beyond the stage of mental dullness and confusion, with asterixis and EEG changes. In yet others, a subtle disorder of mood, personality, and intellect may be protracted over a period of many months or even years; this chronic but nevertheless reversible mental disturbance need not be associated with overt clinical signs of liver failure (jaundice and ascites) or other neurologic signs. Characteristically in these patients, an extensive portal–systemic collateral circulation can be demonstrated (hence the term portal–systemic encephalopathy) and an association established between the mental disturbance and an intolerance to dietary protein as well as raised blood ammonia levels (Summerskill et al).

The diversion of blood from the portal system into the vena cava after ligation of the portal veins was first performed in dogs by Eck in 1877. Probably the first and certainly most striking example in man was the case of pure “Eck” fistula reported by McDermott and Adams, in which a portacaval shunt was created during the removal of a pancreatic tumor. The liver was normal. Episodic coma occurred thereafter whenever dietary protein increased. Consciousness was restored on a protein-free diet, and coma could be induced again by ammonium chloride. Postmortem examination 2 years later confirmed the normal liver and showed cerebral changes of hepatic encephalopathy, as described below.

work and indifference to criticism, irritability, and stubbornness (clearly traceable to a mild dementia). Only when Babinski signs and loss of tendon reflexes in the legs were detected was the correct diagnosis entertained for the first time. By then he had been ill for nearly 10 years. Bosch and Hart described a patient with the onset of dementia at 62 years of age and drew attention to 27 other similar cases of adult-onset metachromatic leukoencephalopathy (see also the 7 cases reported by Turpin and Baumann). Overt signs of neuropathy are usually lacking in these adult-onset

In the late encephalopathic forms of the metabolic and mitochondrial diseases, the diagnosis is usually made only after symptoms have been present for months or years, the disease having been mistaken for some other condition, particularly depression or a degenerative dementia. Even a manifest psychosis may have occurred in relation to some of these disorders, but such occurrences are admittedly rare. For example, one of our patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy, a 30-year-old man, began failing in college years and was later unsuccessful in holding a job because of carelessness and mistakes in his work and indifference to

After 5 minutes of pushing, there is a prolonged deceleration of the fetal heart rate to 90/min. A decision to perform an episiotomy is made to expedite vaginal delivery. The anesthesiologist locates the ischial spines by palpating the posterolateral vaginal sidewall and administers an anesthetic. Three minutes later, pinching the posterior vulva does not provoke pain. The anesthetized nerve most likely also supplies which of the following structures?

Local anesthetics can be injected into the extradural space or the subarachnoid space to anesthetize the sacral and lumbar nerve roots. Such anesthesia is useful for operations on the pelvis and the legs, which can then be carried out without the need for general anesthesia. When procedures are carried out, the patient must be in the erect position and not lying on his or her side or in the head-down position. If a patient lies on his or her side, the anesthesia is likely to be unilateral. If the patient is placed in the head-down position, the anesthetic can pass cranially and potentially depress respiration.

In some instances, anesthesiologists choose to carry out extradural anesthesia. A needle is placed through the skin, supraspinous ligament, interspinous ligament, and ligamenta flava into the areolar tissue and fat around the dura mater. Anesthetic agent is introduced and diffuses around the vertebral canal to anesthetize the exiting nerve roots and diffuse into the subarachnoid space.

In the clinic

Herpes zoster is the virus that produces chickenpox in children. In some patients the virus remains dormant in the cells of the spinal ganglia. Under certain circumstances, the virus becomes activated and travels along the neuronal bundles to the areas supplied by that nerve (the dermatome). A rash ensues, which is characteristically exquisitely painful. Importantly, this typical dermatomal distribution is characteristic of this disorder.

In the clinic

Back pain is an extremely common condition affecting almost all individuals at some stage during their life. It is of key clinical importance to identify whether the back pain relates to the vertebral column and its attachments or relates to other structures.

To meet these goals, 24-hour, in-house anesthesia coverage is usually necessary. Providing such service in smaller facilities is more challenging-a problem underscored by the fact that approximately a third of all hospitals providing obstetrical care perform fewer than 500 deliveries per year. The financial burden incurred to provide 24/7 obstetrical anesthesia coverage may result in cost deicits (Bell, 2000). Compounding this burden, some third-party payers have denied reimbursement for epidural analgesia in the absence of a specific medical indication-an approach repudiated by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017a).

For most diagnostic and many operative procedures, effective cervical anesthesia is obtained using local anesthesia, allowing the hysteroscopy to be done in an office procedure room. Evidence suggests that the paracervical block may be the most effective (208,209). Following exposure of the cervix with a vaginal speculum, a spinal needle can be used to instill about 3 mL of 0.5% to 1% lidocaine into the anterior lip of the cervix to allow attachment of a tenaculum and manipulation of the exocervix. While the exact location and depth of the injection varies with providers and

If open pneumothorax is identified, an occlusive dressing must be applied immediately. This must be secured on three sides only to prevent the development of tension pneumothorax.

Massive hemothorax is diagnosed through chest tube placement and is defined as > 1000 cc of immediate blood return or > 200/hour for > 2–4 hours. The treatment for massive hemothorax is volume resuscitation followed by surgery to repair the site of bleeding. The treatment for ﬂail chest is supportive, followed by surgical fixation of the chest wall.

Circulation:

Apply direct pressure to any actively bleeding wounds.

Place a 16-gauge IV in each antecubital fossa.

Isotonic ﬂuids (LR or NS) are repleted in a 3:1 ratio (ﬂuid to blood loss). Start with a ﬂuid bolus of 1–2 L in adults; then recheck vitals and continue repletion as indicated.

If the patient remains tachycardic or hypotensive after the first 2 L of isotonic ﬂuid, transfusion with packed RBCs may be indicated.

To remember the Glasgow Coma Scale, think 4-eyes, Jackson-5, V6 engine. Four points can be assigned for eye response, five points for verbal response, and six points for motor response.

Patients with chest trauma and shock may have cardiac tamponade. The relevant signs are JVD, hypotension, and mufﬂed heart sounds. This can be diagnosed with bedside ultrasound. If tamponade is diagnosed, an immediate pericardiocentesis is necessary.

Disability/Exposure:

Disability (CNS dysfunction) is assessed and quantified with the GCS.

Exposure requires that the patient be completely disrobed and assessed for injury and temperature status on both the front and back of the body. Hypothermia is a common problem in trauma and can worsen bleeding; once the exam is done, the patient should be covered with warm blankets.

Once the patient is stable, conduct a full examination.

P. aeruginosa, or (rarely) S. pneumoniae. Aspiration pneumonia is typically a polymicrobial infection involving both aerobes and anaerobes. A significant pleural effusion should be tapped for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. If the fluid has a pH of <7, a glucose level of <2. 2 mmol/L, and a lactate dehydrogenase concentration of >1000 U/L or if bacteria are seen or cultured, then it should be completely drained; a chest tube is often required and video-assisted thoracoscopy may be needed for late treatment or difficult cases.

Follow-Up Fever and leukocytosis usually resolve within 2–4 days in otherwise healthy patients with CAP, but physical findings may persist longer. Chest radiographic abnormalities are slowest to resolve (4–12 weeks), with the speed of clearance depending on the patient’s age and underlying lung disease. Patients may be discharged from the hospital once their clinical conditions, including comorbidities, are stable. The site of residence after discharge (nursing home, home with family, home alone) is an important discharge timing consideration, particularly for elderly patients. For a hospitalized patient, a follow-up radiograph ∼4–6 weeks later is recommended. If relapse or recurrence is documented, particularly in the same lung segment, the possibility of an underlying neoplasm must be considered.

The prognosis of CAP depends on the patient’s age, comorbidities, and site of treatment (inpatient or outpatient). Young patients without comorbidity do well and usually recover fully after ~2 weeks. Older patients and those with comorbid conditions can take several weeks longer to recover fully. The overall mortality rate for the outpatient group is <1%. For patients requiring hospitalization, the overall mortality rate is estimated at 10%, with ~50% of deaths directly attributable to pneumonia.

The main preventive measure is vaccination (Chap. 148). Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices should be followed for influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.

Pneumonia Pneumonia is the most common serious pneumococcal syndrome and is considered invasive when associated with a positive blood culture. Pneumococcal pneumonia can present as a mild community-acquired infection at one extreme and as a life-threatening disease requiring intubation and intensive support at the other.

presenting manifestations The presentation of pneumococcal pneumonia does not reliably distinguish it from pneumonia of other etiologies. In a subset of cases, pneumococcal pneumonia is recognized at the outset as associated with a viral upper respiratory infection and is characterized by the abrupt onset of cough and dyspnea accompanied by fever, shaking chills, and myalgias. The cough evolves from nonpurulent to productive of sputum that is purulent and sometimes tinged with blood. Patients may describe stabbing pleuritic chest pain and significant dyspnea indicating involvement of the parietal pleura. Among the elderly, the presenting clinical symptoms may be less specific, with confusion or malaise but without fever or cough. In such cases, a high index of suspicion is required because failure to treat pneumococcal pneumonia promptly in an elderly patient is likely to result in rapid evolution of the infection, with increased severity, morbidity, and risk of death.

findings on pHysical examination The clinical signs associated with pneumococcal pneumonia among adults include tachypnea (>30 breaths/min) and tachycardia, hypotension in severe cases, and fever in most cases (although not in all elderly patients). Respiratory signs are varied, including dullness to percussion in areas of the chest with significant consolidation, crackles on auscultation, reduced expansion of the chest in some cases as a result of splinting to reduce pain, bronchial breathing in a minority of cases, pleural rub in occasional cases, and cyanosis in cases with significant hypoxemia. Among infants with severe pneumonia, chest wall indrawing and nasal flaring are common. Nonrespiratory findings can include upper abdominal pain if the diaphragmatic pleura is involved as well as mental status changes, particularly confusion in elderly patients.

Oxygen therapy and hydration should be initiated in addition to antibiotic therapy. Most patients will have an adequate clinical response within 3 days of treatment. Oral antibiotics may be given when patients meet the following criteria: ability to eat and drink, improvement in cough and dyspnea, afebrile (<100◦F) on two occasions 8 hours apart, and a decreasing white blood cell count. If other clinical features are favorable, patients may be switched to oral antibiotics even if febrile. They may be discharged on the same day that oral antibiotics are started if other medical and social factors are favorable.

Vaccination The pneumococcal vaccine should be given to people at high risk for pneumonia, which includes adults 65 years or older and people with special health problems, such as heart or lung disease, alcoholism, kidney failure, diabetes, HIV infection, or certain types of cancer. Repeat vaccination is recommended 5 years after the first dose is given. The vaccine is active against 23 types of pneumococcal strains, and most individuals develop protection within 2 to 3 weeks of inoculations.

The inﬂuenza vaccine should be given every fall to high-risk groups: individuals 50 years of age or older; anyone with serious long-term health problems such as heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, diabetes, and weak immune systems as with HIV and AIDS;

In a reproductive-aged patient who has had a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, with or without a hysterectomy, for severe endometriosis or PID, chronic pelvic pain may be caused by ovarian remnant syndrome. This syndrome results from residual ovarian cortical tissue that is left in situ after a difficult dissection in an attempt to perform an oophorectomy. This tissue can become encased in adhesions and result in painful cysts. Often, the patient had multiple pelvic operations with the uterus and adnexa removed sequentially. Laparoscopic oophorectomy, combined with a difficult dissection, is a strong risk factor.

Residual ovary syndrome is uncommon considering the number of women undergoing hysterectomy with ovarian preservation. Theoretically, after a hysterectomy with one or both ovaries intentionally left in situ, adhesions develop and encase the ovaries, then cyclical expansion of the ovaries can result in pain and, in some cases, a tender persistent mass.

The patient usually reports lateralizing pelvic pain, often cycling with ovulation or the luteal phase that is described as sharp and stabbing or constant, dull, and nonradiating, occasionally with associated genitourinary or gastrointestinal symptoms. Symptoms tend to arise 2 to 5 years after initial oophorectomy. A tender mass in the lateral region of the pelvis is pathognomonic. The patient may report deep dyspareunia, constipation, or ﬂank pain.

Pelvic inflammatory disease most commonly presents with bilateral lower abdominal pain. It is generally of recent onset and is exacerbated by intercourse or jarring movements. Fever is present in about half of these patients; abnormal uterine bleeding occurs in about one-third. New vaginal discharge, urethritis, and chills may be present but are less specific signs. Adnexal pathology can present acutely and may be due to rupture, bleeding or torsion of cysts, or, much less commonly, neoplasms of the ovary, fallopian tubes, or paraovarian areas. Fever may be present with ovarian torsion. Ectopic pregnancy is associated with rightor left-sided lower abdominal pain, with clinical signs generally appearing 6–8 weeks after the last normal menstrual period. Amenorrhea is present in ~75% of cases and vaginal bleeding in ~50% of cases. Orthostatic signs and fever may be present. Risk factors include the presence of known tubal disease, previous ectopic pregnancies, a history of infertility, diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure of the mother in utero, or a history of pelvic infections. Threatened abortion may also present with amenorrhea, abdominal pain, and vaginal bleeding. Although more common than ectopic pregnancy, it is rarely associated with systemic signs. Uterine pathology includes endometritis and, less frequently, degenerating leiomyomas (fibroids). Endometritis often is associated with vaginal bleeding and systemic signs of infection. It occurs in the setting of sexually transmitted infections, uterine instrumentation, or postpartum infection.

A sensitive pregnancy test, complete blood count with differential, urinalysis, tests for chlamydial and gonococcal infections, and abdominal ultrasound aid in making the diagnosis and directing further management.

The typical history for appendicitis is a central abdominal, colicky (intermittent waxing and waning) pain, which over a period of hours localizes to become a constant pain in the right iliac fossa. The central colicky pain is typical for a poorly localized visceral type of pain. As the parietal peritoneum becomes inflamed, the pain becomes localized. Although this patient does have right iliac fossa pain, the history is not typical for appendicitis (although it must be remembered that patients may not always have a classical history for appendicitis).

The surgical intern asked a more senior colleague for an opinion.

The senior colleague considered other anatomical structures that lie within the right iliac fossa as a potential cause of pain. These include the appendix, the cecum, and the small bowel. Musculoskeletal pain and referred pain could also be potential causes. In women, pain may also arise from the ovary, fallopian tube, and uterus. In a young patient, diseases of these organs are rare. Infection and pelvic inflammatory disease may occur in the younger patient and need to be considered.

The patient gave no history of these disorders.

Upon further questioning, however, the patient revealed that her last menstrual period was 6 weeks before this examination. The senior physician realized that a potential cause of the abdominal pain was a pregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy). The patient was rushed for an abdominal ultrasound, which revealed no fetus or sac in the uterus. She was also noted to have a positive pregnancy test. The patient underwent surgery and was found to have a ruptured fallopian tube caused by an ectopic pregnancy.

Whenever a patient has apparent pelvic pain, it is important to consider the gender-related anatomical differences. Ectopic pregnancy should always be considered in women of childbearing age.

A 35-year-old woman visited her family practitioner because she had a “bloating” feeling and an increase in abdominal girth. The family practitioner examined the lower abdomen, which revealed a mass that extended from the superior pubic rami to the level of the umbilicus. The superior margin of the mass was easily palpated, but the inferior margin appeared to be less well defined.

for excluding ovarian causes of abdominal pain. Despite these radiographic measures, the diagnosis of appendi-citis remains largely clinical, and each clinician should develop his or her own threshold to operate or to observe the patient. A reasonable practice guideline is as follows. When the diagno-sis is clinically apparent, appendectomy should obviously be performed with minimal delay. Localized right lower quadrant tenderness associated with low-grade fever and leukocytosis in boys should prompt surgical exploration. In girls, ovarian or uterine pathology must also be considered. When there is diag-nostic uncertainty, the child may be observed,

Hx/PE: Presents with pain out of proportion to physical findings; pain with passive motion of the fingers and toes; and paresthesias, pallor, poikilothermia, pulselessness, and paralysis. Pulselessness occurs late.

Dx: Measure compartment pressures (usually ≥ 30 mmHg); measure delta pressures (diastolic pressure – compartment pressure).

Tx: Immediate fasciotomy to ↓ pressures and ↑ tissue perfusion.

Entrapment of the median nerve at the wrist caused by ↓ size or space of the carpal tunnel, leading to paresthesias, pain, and occasionally paralysis. Can be precipitated by overuse of wrist ﬂexors, diabetes mellitus, or thyroid dysfunction. Commonly occurs in pregnant and middle-aged women.

Presents with aching over the thenar area of the hand and proximal forearm. Pain may extend to the shoulder.

Paresthesia or numbness is seen in a median nerve distribution.

Symptoms worsen at night or when the wrists are held in ﬂexion or extension.

Patients may report frequently dropping objects or inability to open jars.

Exam shows thenar atrophy (if CTS is long-standing).

Phalen’s maneuver and Tinel’s sign are .

A clinical diagnosis, although EMG testing can be used to confirm.

Splint the wrist in a neutral position at night and during the day if possible. Administer NSAIDs.

Conservative treatment can include corticosteroid injection of the carpal canal.

Work-related CTS may benefit from ergonomic aids.

CTS of pregnancy usually resolves after delivery.

Surgical release of the carpal tunnel is a widely accepted treatment, particularly for fixed sensory loss, thenar weakness, or intolerable symptoms.

Permanent loss of sensation, hand strength, and fine motor skills.

With reference to the most common of these symptoms, the neck and shoulder pain, in any sizable group of patients older than 50 years of age, approximately 40 percent will be found at times to have some clinical abnormality of the neck, usually crepitus or pain, with restriction of lateral flexion and rotation (less often of extension). Pallis and colleagues, in a survey of 50 patients, all of them older than 50 years of age and none with neurologic complaints, found that 75 percent showed radiologic evidence of narrowing of the cervical spinal canal as a result of osteophytosis of the posterior vertebral bodies or of narrowing of the intervertebral foramina because of osteoarthropathy at the apophyseal joints; thickening of the ligaments (both the ligamentum flavum posteriorly and the posterior longitudinal ligament anteriorly) adds to the narrowing of the canal. However, only half of the patients with radiologic abnormalities showed physical signs of root or cord involvement such as changes in the tendon reflexes in the arms, briskness of reflexes and impairment of vibratory sense in the legs, and sometimes Babinski signs. The occasional finding of a Babinski sign in older individuals who had never had a stroke or complained of neurologic symptoms is often explained by an otherwise inevident cervical osteophyte (Savitsky and Madonick).

The pain is usually centered at the base of the neck or higher, often radiating to an area above the scapula. When brachialgia is also present, it takes several forms: a sharp pain in the preor postaxial border of the limb, extending to the elbow, wrist, or fingers; or a persistent dull ache in the forearm or wrist, sometimes with a burning sensation. Discomfort may be elicited by coughing, Valsalva maneuver, or neck extension, or neck flexion may induce electrical feelings down the spine (Lhermitte symptom). Rarely, the pain is referred substernally.

CTS consist of numbness and paresthesias variably in the thumb, index, middle, and half of the ring finger. At times, the paresthesias can include the entire hand and extend into the forearm or upper arm or can be isolated to one or two fingers. Pain is another common symptom and can be located in the hand and forearm and, at times, in the proximal arm. CTS is common and often misdiagnosed as thoracic outlet syndrome. The signs of CTS are decreased sensation in the median nerve distribution; reproduction of the sensation of tingling when a percussion hammer is tapped over the wrist (Tinel’s sign) or the wrist is flexed for 30–60 s (Phalen’s sign); and weakness of thumb opposition and abduction. EDx is extremely sensitive and shows slowing of sensory and, to a lesser extent, motor median potentials across the wrist. Treatment options consist of avoidance of precipitating activities; control of underlying systemic-associated conditions if present; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications; neutral (volar) position wrist splints, especially for night use; glucocorticoid/anesthetic injection into the carpal tunnel; and surgical decompression by dividing the transverse carpal ligament. The surgical option should be considered if there is a poor response to nonsurgical treatments; if there is thenar muscle atrophy and/or weakness; and if there are significant denervation potentials on EMG.

Other proximal median neuropathies are very uncommon and include the pronator teres syndrome and anterior interosseous neuropathy. These often occur as a partial form of brachial plexitis.

parkinson’s Disease and other movement Disorders C. Warren Olanow, Anthony H.V. Schapira, Jose A. Obeso PARKINSON’S DISEASE AND RELATED DISORDERS Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second commonest neurodegenerative 449 disease, exceeded only by Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Its cardinal clinical features were first described by the English physician James Parkinson in 1817. It is noteworthy that James Parkinson was a general physician who captured the essence of this condition based on a visual inspection of a mere handful of patients. It is estimated that approximately 1 million persons in the United States, 1 million in Western Europe, and 5 million worldwide suffer from this disorder. PD affects men and women of all races, all occupations, and all countries. The mean age of onset is about 60 years. The frequency of PD increases with aging, but cases can be seen in patients in their 20s and even younger. Based on the aging of the population and projected demographics, it is estimated that the prevalence of the disease will dramatically increase in the next several decades.

Clinically, PD is characterized by rest tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia (slowing), and gait impairment, known as the “cardinal features” of the disease. Additional features can include freezing of gait, postural instability, speech difficulty, autonomic disturbances, sensory alterations, mood disorders, sleep dysfunction, cognitive impairment, and dementia (Table 449-1).

The spectrum of normal sexual response varies from one woman to another and throughout a woman’s lifetime (1–3). Physicians should be aware of their patients’ sexual values, attitudes about specific practices, and concerns about their sexuality. Maintaining open communication with patients about their sexuality allows the physician to counsel them about sexual issues and problems and other aspects of their reproductive health.

Sexual Activity Sexual activity among adolescents in the United States increased during the past 20 years (3). The average age for first intercourse for both men and women is 16 years. By 19 years of age, as many as three-quarters of women have had intercourse. Most young men and young women have multiple serial sexual partners but use condoms inconsistently, thereby exposing themselves to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and unintended pregnancies. A recent study of North American women, using a large and diverse community-based sample, shows that of the 3,205 women aged 30 to 79 years almost one-half were not sexually active in the previous 4 weeks, with 52% of those citing lack of interest and 61% citing lack of partner as the major reasons. Of those who were sexually active recently, 13.7% noted sexual problems and dissatisfaction with their overall sexual lives (4).

Sexual Dysfunction (See Chap. 67) Various forms of sexual dysfunction are a major motivating factor for men seeking care at men’s health clinics. The landmark descriptions of the human sexual response cycle by Masters and Johnson, demonstrating that men and women display predictable physiologic responses after sexual stimulation, provided the basis for rational classification of human sexual disorders. Accordingly, sexual disorders have been classified into four categories depending on phase of sexual response cycle in which the abnormality exists: 1.

2.

3.

4.

Disorders of pain

Classification of the patient’s disorder into these categories is important because the etiologic factors, diagnostic tests, and therapeutic

Total testosterone (ng/dL) vs. Age (y) during the reproductive and postreproductive years vary substantially between men and women and may influence the sex differences in the temporal evolution of age-related conditions such as osteoporosis, breast cancer, and autoimmune disease.

The disturbance must last for a period of at least 4 weeks in children and adolescents younger than 18 years and is typically 6 months or longer in adults (Criterion B). However, the duration criterion for adults should be used as a general guide, with allowance for some degree of ﬂexibility. The disturbance must cause clinically significant distress or im- pairment in social, academic, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Cri- terion C).

When separated from major attachment figures, children with separation anxiety disorder may exhibit social withdrawal, apathy, sadness, or difficulty concentrating on work or play. Depending on their age, individuals may have fears of animals, monsters, the dark, muggers, burglars, kidnappers, car accidents, plane travel, and other situations that are perceived as presenting danger to the family or themselves. Some individuals become homesick and uncomfortable to the point of misery when away from home. Separation anxiety disorder in children may lead to school refusal, which in turn may lead to academic difficulties and social isolation. When extremely upset at the prospect of separation, chil- dren may show anger or occasionally aggression toward someone who is forcing separa- tion. When alone, especially in the evening or the dark, young children may report unusual perceptual experiences (e.g., seeing people peering into their room, frightening creatures reaching for them, feeling eyes staring at them). Children with this disorder may be de- scribed as demanding, intrusive, and in need of constant attention, and, as adults, may ap- pear dependent and overprotective. The individual’s excessive demands often become a source of frustration for family members, leading to resentment and conﬂict in the family.

The 12-month prevalence of separation anxiety disorder among adults in the United States is 0.9%—1.9%. In children, 6- to 12-month prevalence is estimated to be approximately 4%.

In adolescents in the United States, the 12-month prevalence is 1.6%. Separation anxiety is the most prevalent anxiety disorder in children younger than 12 years. In clinical sam- ples of children, the disorder is equally common in males and females. In the community, the disorder is more frequent in females.

the main cause of declining androgen levels. The term andropause has been used to denote age-related decline in testosterone concentrations; this term is a misnomer because there is no discrete time when testosterone concentrations decline abruptly. The approach to evaluating hypogonadism is summarized in Fig. 411-6.

In epidemiologic surveys, low total and bioavailable testosterone concentrations have been associated with decreased appendicular skeletal muscle mass and strength, decreased self-reported physical function, higher visceral fat mass, insulin resistance, and increased risk of coronary artery disease and mortality, although the associations are weak. An analysis of signs and symptoms in older men in the European Male Aging Study revealed a syndromic association of sexual symptoms with total testosterone levels below 320 ng/dL and free testosterone levels below 64 pg/mL in community-dwelling older men. In systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials, testosterone therapy of healthy older men with low or low-normal testosterone levels was associated with greater increments in lean body mass, grip strength, and self-reported physical function compared with placebo. Testosterone therapy also induced greater improvement in vertebral but not femoral bone mineral density. Testosterone therapy of older men with sexual dysfunction and unequivocally low testosterone levels improves libido, but testosterone effects on erectile function and response to selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors have been inconsistent. Testosterone therapy has not been shown to improve depression scores, fracture risk, cognitive function, response to phosphodiesterase inhibitors, or clinical outcomes in older men. Furthermore, neither the long-term risks nor clinical benefits of testosterone therapy in older men have been demonstrated in adequately powered trials. Although there is no evidence that testosterone causes prostate cancer, there is concern that testosterone therapy might cause subclinical prostate cancers to grow. Testosterone therapy is associated with increased risk of detection of prostate events (Fig. 411-7).

Primary hyperparathyroidism usually is a disease of adults and is much more common in women than in men (gender ratio of nearly 4:1). The most common manifestation of primary hyperparathyroidism is an increase in serum ionized calcium. In fact, primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of clinically silent hypercalcemia. Other conditions also may produce hypercalcemia (

Table 20.4 ). The most common cause of clinically apparent hypercalcemia

The prognosis for patients with malignancy-associated hypercalcemia is poor, because it often occurs in those with advanced cancers. In individuals with hypercalcemia caused by parathyroid hyperfunction, serum PTH is inappropriately elevated, whereas serum PTH is low to undetectable in those with hypercalcemia caused by nonparathyroid diseases, including malignancy. Other laboratory alterations referable to PTH excess include hypophosphatemia and increased urinary excretion of both calcium and phosphate.

Clinical Manifestations The typical presentation of HHM is a patient with a known malignancy who is found to be hypercalcemic on routine laboratory tests. Less often, hypercalcemia is the initial presenting feature of malignancy. Particularly when calcium levels are markedly increased (>3.5 mmol/L [>14 mg/dL]), patients may experience fatigue, mental status changes, dehydration, or symptoms of nephrolithiasis.

Diagnosis Features that favor HHM, as opposed to primary hyperparathyroidism, include known malignancy, recent onset of hypercalcemia, and very high serum calcium levels. Like hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia caused by PTHrP is accompanied by hypercalciuria and hypophosphatemia. Patients with HHM typically have metabolic alkalosis rather than hyperchloremic acidosis, as is seen in hyperparathyroidism. Measurement of PTH is useful to exclude primary hyperparathyroidism; the PTH level should be suppressed in HHM. An elevated PTHrP level confirms the diagnosis, and it is increased in ~80% of hypercalcemic patients with cancer. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D levels may be increased in patients with lymphoma.

Elderly individuals with reduced thirst and/or diminished access to fluids are at the highest risk of developing hypernatremia. Patients with hypernatremia may rarely have a central defect in hypothalamic osmoreceptor function, with a mixture of both decreased thirst and reduced AVP secretion. Causes of this adipsic diabetes insipidus include primary or metastatic tumor, occlusion or ligation of the anterior communicating artery, trauma, hydrocephalus, and inflammation.

FIguRE 63-6 The diagnostic approach to hypernatremia. ECF, extracellular fluid.

Hypernatremia can develop following the loss of water via both 303 renal and nonrenal routes. Insensible losses of water may increase in the setting of fever, exercise, heat exposure, severe burns, or mechanical ventilation. Diarrhea is, in turn, the most common gastrointestinal cause of hypernatremia. Notably, osmotic diarrhea and viral gastroenteritides typically generate stools with Na+ and K+ <100 mM, thus leading to water loss and hypernatremia; in contrast, secretory diarrhea typically results in isotonic stool and thus hypovolemia with or without hypovolemic hyponatremia.

Common causes of renal water loss include osmotic diuresis secondary to hyperglycemia, excess urea, postobstructive diuresis, or mannitol; these disorders share an increase in urinary solute excretion and urinary osmolality (see “Diagnostic Approach,” below). Hypernatremia due to a water diuresis occurs in central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI).

• Management of Second-Stage Labor

With full cervical dilation, which signiies the onset of the second stage, a woman typically begins to bear down. With descent of the presenting part, she develops the urge to defecate. Uterine contractions and the accompanying expulsive forces may now last 1 minute and recur at an interval no longer than 90 seconds. As discussed earlier, the median duration of the second stage is 50 minutes in nulliparas and 20 minutes in multiparas, although the interval can vary. Monitoring intervals of the fetal heart rate were discussed on page 436, and interpretation of second-stage electronic fetal heart rate patterns is discussed in Chapter 24 (p. 469).

In most cases, bearing down is reflexive and spontaneous during second-stage labor. Occasionally, a woman may not employ her expulsive forces to good advantage and coaching is desirable. Her legs should be half-flexed so that she can push with them against the mattress. When the next uterine contraction begins, she is instructed to exert downward pressure as though she were straining at stool. A woman is not encouraged to push beyond the completion of each contraction. Instead, she and her fetus are allowed to rest and recover. During this period of actively bearing down, the fetal heart rate auscultated during the contraction is likely to be slow but should recover to normal range before the next expulsive efort. Fetal and obstetrical outcomes appear to be unafected whether pushing is coached or uncoached during second-stage labor (Bloom, 2006; Tuuli, 2012). Bloom and colleagues (2006) studied efects of actively coaching expulsive eforts in women without epidural analgesia. hey reported that although the second stage was slightly shorter in coached women, no other maternal advantages were gained.

Notably, these risk projections assume that the woman is undergoing regular clinical breast examinations and screen-ing mammograms. Also of note is that this program underes-timates the risk for women who have already had a diagnosis of invasive or noninvasive breast cancer and does not take into account specific genetic predispositions such as mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. However, risk assessment tools such as this have been validated and are now in widespread clinical use.

Quickening, or appreciation of fetal movement: Typically occurs at 17–18 weeks.

Fetal heart tones: Can be heard at 10–12 weeks by Doppler.

Ultrasound: Measures fetal crown-rump length (CRL) at 5–12 weeks and measures biparietal diameter (BPD), femur length (FL), and abdominal circumference (AC) from 13 weeks. Ultrasound measurement of GA is most reliable during the f rst trimester.

Normal Physiology of Pregnancy

The normal physiologic changes that occur during pregnancy are graphically illustrated according to system in Figures 2.11-2 and 2.11-3.

Breast budding under the areola (thelarche) and fine straight pubic hair over the mons pubis (adrenarche or pubarche)are early pubertal changes occurring around 11 years of age (range, 8 to 13 years) (see Chapter 174). These changes mark the sexual maturity rating, or Tanner stage, II of pubertal development (Figs. 67-3 and 67-4). Completion of the Tanner stages should take 4 to 5 years. The peak growth spurt usually

Tanner, MD, Institute of Child Health, Department of Growth and Development, University of London, London, England.) occurs approximately 1 year after thelarche at sexual maturity rating stage III to IV breast development and before the onset of menstruation (menarche). Menarche is a relatively late pubertal event. Females grow only 2 to 5 cm in height before menarche (see Chapter 174).

Other important hormonal changes also occur in conjunction with puberty. Growth hormone (GH) levels increase early in puberty, stimulated in part by the pubertal increases in estrogen secretion. GH increases insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), which enhances linear growth. The growth spurt is generally less pronounced in girls than in boys, with a peak growth velocity of ~7 cm/year. Linear growth is ultimately limited by closure of epiphyses in the long bones as a result of prolonged exposure to estrogen. Puberty is also associated with mild insulin resistance.

Disorders of the Female Reproductive System length counted from the first day of menses to the first day of subsequent menses is ~28 days, with a range of 25–35 days. However, cycle-to-cycle variability for an individual

The differential diagnosis of precocious and delayed puberty is similar in boys (Chap. 411) and girls. However, there are differences in the timing of normal puberty and differences in the relative frequency of specific disorders in girls compared with boys.

Precocious Puberty Traditionally, precocious puberty has been defined as the development of secondary sexual characteristics before the age of 8 in girls based on data from Marshall and Tanner in British girls studied in the 1960s. More recent studies led to recommendations that girls be evaluated for precocious puberty if breast development or pubic hair is present at <7 years of age for white girls or <6 years for black girls.

Hemodialysis is the most effective and reliable method to reduce plasma K+ concentration; peritoneal dialysis is considerably less effective. Patients with acute kidney injury require temporary, urgent venous access for hemodialysis, with the attendant risks; in contrast, patients with ESRD or advanced chronic kidney disease may have a preexisting venous access. The amount of K+ removed during hemodialysis depends on the relative distribution of K+ between ICF and ECF (potentially affected by prior therapy for hyperkalemia), the type and surface area of the dialyzer used, dialysate and blood flow rates, dialysate flow rate, dialysis duration, and the plasma-to-dialysate K+ gradient.

Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalances and Acid-Base Disturbances: Case Examples David B. Mount, Thomas D. DuBose, Jr. CASE 1 64e

A 23-year-old woman was admitted with a 3-day history of fever, cough productive of blood-tinged sputum, confusion, and orthostasis. Past medical history included type 1 diabetes mellitus. A physical examination in the emergency department indicated postural hypo-tension, tachycardia, and Kussmaul respiration. The breath was noted to smell of “acetone.” Examination of the thorax suggested consolidation in the right lower lobe.

The diagnosis of the acid-base disorder should proceed in a stepwise fashion: 1.

The normal anion gap (AG) is 8–10 meq/L, but in this case, the AG is elevated (20 meq/L). Therefore, the change in AG (ΔAG) = ~10 meq/L.

A 32-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with weakness and hypokalemia. The patient had been very healthy until 2 months previously when he developed intermittent leg weakness. His review of systems was otherwise negative. He denied drug or laxative abuse and was on no medications. Past medical history was unremarkable, with no history of neuromuscular disease. Family history was notable for a sister with thyroid disease. Physical examination was notable only for reduced deep tendon reflexes.

This patient developed hypokalemia due to a redistribution of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular compartments; this pathophysiology was readily apparent following calculation of the TTKG. The TTKG is calculated as (P × U )/(P ×

U ). The expected values for the TTKG are <3 in the presence of hypokalemia and >7–8 in the presence of hyperkalemia (see also Case 2 and Case 8). Alternatively, a urinary K+-to-creatinine ratio of >13 mmol/g creatinine (>1.5 mmol/mmol creatinine) is compatible with excessive renal K+ excretion. In this case, the calculated TTKG was 2.5, consistent with appropriate renal conservation of K+ and a nonrenal cause for hypokalemia. In the absence of significant gastrointestinal loss of K+, the patient was diagnosed with a “redistributive” subtype of hypokalemia.

The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly.

The plasma Na+ concentration on admission was 113 meq/L, with a creatinine of 2.35 (Table 64e-1). At hospital hour 7, the plasma Na+ concentration was 120 meq/L, potassium 5.4 meq/L, chloride 90 64e-5 meq/L, bicarbonate 22 meq/L, BUN 32 mg/dL, creatinine 2.02 mg/dL, glucose 89 mg/dL, total protein 5.0, and albumin 1.9. The hematocrit was 33.9, white count 7.6, and platelets 405. A morning cortisol was 19.5, with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 1.7. The patient was treated with 1 μg of intravenous DDAVP, along with 75 mL/h of intravenous half-normal saline. After the plasma Na+ concentration dropped to 116 meq/L, intravenous fluid was switched to normal saline at the same infusion rate. The subsequent results are shown in Table 64e-1.

This patient presented with hypovolemic hyponatremia and a “prerenal” reduction in GFR, with an increase in serum creatinine. She had experienced diarrhea for some time and manifested an orthostatic tachycardia after a liter of normal saline. As expected for hypovolemic hyponatremia, the urine Na+ concentration was <20 meq/L in the absence of congestive heart failure or other causes of hypervolemic hyponatremia, and she responded to saline hydration with an increase in plasma Na+ concentration and a decrease in creatinine.

A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 36-hour history of lower abdominal pain that was sharp and initially intermittent, later becoming constant and severe. The patient also reported feeling nauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have diarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours before admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative.

On physical examination there was tenderness in the right iliac fossa with guarding. On vaginal examination a tender mass in the right adnexal region was felt. The patient subsequently underwent a transvaginal ultrasound examination for evaluation of adnexal pathology. The scan showed a markedly enlarged right ovary measuring up to 8 cm in long axis with echogenic stroma and peripherally distributed follicles. There was no internal vascularity when color Doppler was applied. A small amount of free fluid was seen in the pouch of Douglas. The diagnosis of ovarian torsion was made.

Ovarian torsion is the twisting of an ovary on its suspensory ligament, which contains arterial, venous, and lymphatic vessels (forming so-called vascular pedicle), leading to a compromised blood supply. Initially, the venous and lymphatic circulation is compromised, resulting in ovarian edema and enlargement. The arterial flow is maintained longer due to thicker and less compressible arterial walls. Prolonged torsion leads to increased internal ovarian pressure that eventually results in arterial thrombosis, ischemia of the ovarian tissue, and necrosis. If the correct diagnosis and treatment are delayed, the patient may develop generalized sepsis.

The symptoms are nonspecific, making the diagnosis of ovarian torsion challenging. There is often no significant past medical history.

Chronic ectopic pregnancy is a condition in which the pregnancy does not completely resorb during expectant management. The condition arises when there is persistence of the chorionic villi with bleeding into the tubal wall, which is distended slowly and does not rupture. It may arise from chronic bleeding from the fimbriated end of the fallopian tube with subsequent tamponade. In a series of 50 patients with a chronic ectopic pregnancy, pain was present in 86%, vaginal bleeding was present in 68%, and both symptoms were present in 58% (234). Ninety percent of the patients had amenorrhea ranging from 5 to 16 weeks (mean, 9.6 weeks). Most patients develop a pelvic mass that usually is symptomatic. The β-hCG level usually is low but may be absent; ultrasonography may be helpful in the diagnosis; rarely, bowel involvement or ureteral compression or obstruction exists (234,235).

This condition is treated surgically with removal of the affected tube. Often, the ovary must be removed because there is inﬂammation with subsequent adhesion development. A hematoma may be present secondary to chronic bleeding.

Cervical Pregnancy The incidence of cervical pregnancy in the United States ranges from

Pregnancy 1 in 2,400 to 1 in 50,000 pregnancies and accounts for less than 1% of ectopic pregnancies (236,237). The cause of cervical ectopic pregnancies is unknown and the rare occurrence prevents identification of known risk factors. The incidence does appear to be higher with in vitro fertilization procedures, accounting for 3.7% of IVF-related ectopic pregnancies (238).

The clinical criteria for diagnosing a cervical pregnancy include the following findings (239): 1.

Uterus is smaller than the surrounding distended cervix; 2.

3.

4.

Profuse bleeding on manipulation of cervix.

Patients classically present with painless vaginal bleeding, but reports of associated cramping and pain are published (240).

All women of reproductive age with acute pelvic pain should have a complete blood count with differential, ESR, urinalysis, and a sensitive qualitative urine or serum pregnancy test. If not diagnosed expeditiously, an acute process can often result in significant morbidity or mortality. For patients who have chronic pelvic pain and develop acute exacerbation, it is important to rule out a superimposed acute process. Symptoms of fever, chills, diaphoresis, abnormal vaginal bleeding, dizziness, syncope, emesis, significant diarrhea, obstipation, dysuria, hematuria, and hematochezia, and/or signs of elevated temperature, tachycardia, orthostasis, abdominal distention, abnormal bowel sounds, ascites, peritonitis, or abnormal pregnancy are all indicative of an acute process.

Laboratory tests for the evaluation of acute pelvic pain include a CBC with differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, clean catch midstream RUA, gonorrhea and chlamydia nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) from cervix or urine, and urine or serum pregnancy test. The sedimentation rate is nonspecific, but often is the only abnormal laboratory finding in women with subacute PID. If the pregnancy test is positive, a quantitative β-human chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG) should be ordered. Other studies that are recommended include transvaginal pelvic ultrasound, or if imaging is not available, culdocentesis. The ﬂuid from culdocentesis can be sent for hematocrit if bloody ﬂuid is obtained or Gram stain with culture if the ﬂuid is purulent. The presence of a mass in the cul-de-sac precludes culdocentesis. CT with and without contrast, abdominal x-rays, or upper or lower Gastrografin studies help rule out gastrointestinal pathology when gastrointestinal symptoms predominate. CT is useful for evaluation of retroperitoneal masses or abscesses related to the gastrointestinal tract. Pelvic MRI can be diagnostic if the pelvic ultrasound cannot determine whether a mass is uterine or adnexal.

Laboratory and Imaging Evaluation Patients should have routine blood chemistries and hematologic studies. Specific attention to the platelet count and PT/PTT/INR is important to identify coagulopathy. CT imaging reliably detects acute focal hemorrhages in the supratentorial space. Rarely very small pontine or medullary hemorrhages may not be well delineated because of motion and bone-induced artifact that obscure structures in the posterior fossa. After the first 2 weeks, x-ray attenuation values of clotted blood diminish until they become isodense with surrounding brain. Mass effect and edema may remain. In some cases, a surrounding

document (4) 

some cases, a surrounding rim of contrast enhancement appears after 2–4 weeks and may persist for months. MRI, although more sensitive for delineating posterior fossa lesions, is generally not necessary for primary diagnosis in most instances. Images of flowing blood on MRI scan may identify AVMs as the cause of the hemorrhage. MRI, CT angiography (CTA), and conventional x-ray angiography are used when the cause of intracranial hemorrhage is uncertain, particularly if the patient is young or not hypertensive and the hematoma is not in one of the usual sites for hypertensive hemorrhage. CTA

hypertensive hemorrhage. CTA or postcontrast CT imaging may reveal one or more small areas of enhancement within a hematoma; this “spot sign” is thought to represent ongoing bleeding. The presence of a spot sign is associated with an increased risk of hematoma expansion, increased mortality, and lower likelihood of favorable functional outcome. Some centers routinely perform CT with CTA and postcontrast CT at the time of initial imaging to rapidly identify any macrovascular etiology of the hemorrhage and provide prognostic information at the same time. Because patients typically have focal neurologic signs and obtundation and

Current Directions Many patients have multiple etiologies, and the interactions of HBV, HCV, alcohol, smoking, and aflatoxins are just beginning to be explored.

Symptoms These include abdominal pain, weight loss, weak ness, abdominal fullness and swelling, jaundice, and nausea (Table 111-3). Presenting signs and symptoms differ somewhat between highand low-incidence areas. In high-risk areas, especially in South African blacks, the most common symptom is abdominal pain; by contrast, only 40–50% of Chinese and Japanese patients present with abdominal pain. Abdominal swelling may occur as a consequence of ascites due to the underlying chronic liver disease or may be due to a rapidly expanding tumor. Occasionally, central necrosis or acute hemorrhage into the peritoneal cavity leads to death. In countries with an active surveillance program, HCC tends to be identified at an earlier stage, when symptoms may be due only to the underlying disease. Jaundice is usually due to obstruction of the intrahepatic ducts from underlying liver disease. Hematemesis may occur due to

Liver biopsy reveals periductal sclerosis (“onion skinning”).

Tx: High-dose ursodeoxycholic acid; endoscopic dilation and short-term stenting of bile duct strictures; liver transplantation. Patients are at ↑ risk for cholangiocarcinoma.

Liver diseases can be divided into distinct patterns based on LFT results:

Hepatocellular injury: ↑ AST and ALT.

Cholestasis: ↑ alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin.

Isolated hyperbilirubinemia: ↑ bilirubin; normal aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase.

Jaundice, which can be seen in any of the patterns outlined above, is a clinical sign that arises when excess bilirubin (> 2.5 mg/dL) is circulating in the blood.

Physical Findings Splenomegaly is the most common physical finding, occurring in 20–70% of patients depending on health care screening frequency. Other less common findings include hepatomegaly (10–20%), lymphadenopathy (5–10%), and extramedullary disease (skin or subcutaneous lesions). The latter indicates CML transformation if a biopsy confirms the presence of sheets of blasts. Other physical findings are manifestations of complications of high tumor burden described earlier (e.g., cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, bleeding). High basophil counts may be associated with histamine overproduction causing pruritus, diarrhea, flushing, and even gastrointestinal ulcers.

Hematologic and Marrow Findings In untreated CML, leukocytosis ranging from 10–500 × 109/L is common. The peripheral blood differential shows left-shifted hematopoiesis with predominance of neutrophils and the presence of bands, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, promyelocytes, and blasts (usually ≤5%). Basophils and/or eosinophils are frequently increased. Thrombocytosis is common, but thrombocytopenia is rare and, when present, suggests a worse prognosis, disease acceleration, or an unrelated etiology. Anemia is present in one-third of patients. Cyclic oscillations of counts are noted in 25% of patients without treatment. Biochemical abnormalities include a low leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score and high levels of vitamin B12, uric acid, lactic dehydrogenase, and lysozyme. The presence of unexplained and sustained leukocytosis, with or without splenomegaly, should lead to a marrow examination and cytogenetic analysis.

Although tests may direct the physician to a category of liver disease, additional radiologic testing and procedures are often necessary to make the proper diagnosis, as shown in Fig. 358-1. The most commonly used ancillary tests are reviewed here, as are the noninvasive tests available for assessing hepatic fibrosis.

Percutaneous Liver Biopsy Percutaneous biopsy of the liver is a safe procedure that can be easily performed at the bedside with local anesthesia and ultrasound guidance. Liver biopsy is of proven value in the following situations: (1) hepatocellular disease of uncertain cause, (2) prolonged hepatitis with the possibility of autoimmune hepatitis, (3) unexplained hepatomegaly, (4) unexplained splenomegaly, (5) hepatic filling defects by radiologic imaging, (6) fever of unknown origin, (7) and staging of malignant lymphoma. Liver biopsy is most accurate in disorders causing diffuse changes throughout the liver and is subject to sampling error in focal infiltrative disorders such as hepatic metastases. Liver biopsy should not be the initial procedure in the diagnosis of cholestasis. The biliary tree should first be assessed for signs of obstruction. Contraindications to performing a percutaneous liver biopsy include significant ascites and prolonged INR. Under these circumstances, the biopsy can be performed via the transjugular approach.

The early lesion is clinically indistinguishable from dermatitis, so histologic diagnosis is indicated for any dermatitis that is chronic and resistant to treatment.

Once clinical tumors have evolved, histology is useful for showing the type of cells present.

Stage I disease: Treat topically with steroids, retinoids, chemotherapy, or PUVA.

Stage II disease: Treat systemically with retinoids, interferon, monoclonal antibodies, or chemotherapy.

Photopheresis is the mainstay of treatment for many patients. For more extensive or advanced disease, radiation therapy is an effective option. Treatment modalities are often combined.

Disorders of Glucose Metabolism 114 TYPE 1 DIABETES MELLITUS 114 TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS 115 METABOLIC SYNDROME 117

Due to autoimmune pancreatic β-cell destruction leading to insulin deficiency and abnormal fuel metabolism.

Classically presents with polyuria (especially nocturia), polydipsia, polyphagia, and rapid, unexplained weight loss. Patients may also present with ketoacidosis.

Usually affects nonobese children or young adults.

Associated with HLA-DR3 and -DR4.

At least one of the following is required to make the diagnosis:

A fasting (> 8-hour) plasma glucose of ≥ 126 mg/dL on two separate occasions.

A random plasma glucose of ≥ 200 mg/dL plus symptoms.

A two-hour postprandial glucose of ≥ 200 mg/dL after a glucose tolerance test on two separate occasions if the results of initial testing are equivocal.

Insulin (see Table 2.3-1) and self-monitoring of blood glucose in the normal range (80–120 mg/dL). Higher blood glucose levels (≥ 200 mg/dL) can be tolerated, particularly in the very young, in light of the ↑ risk of hypoglycemia.

Routine HbA1c testing (with a goal HbA1c < 8 in children), frequent BP checks, foot checks, annual dilated-eye exams, annual microalbuminuria screening, and a lipid profile every 2–5 years.

Most exposure in children is due to lead-contaminated household dust from leaded paint. Screening should be routinely performed at 12 and 24 months for patients living in high-risk areas (pre-1950s homes or zip codes with high percentages of elevated blood lead levels).

Presents with irritability, hyperactivity or apathy, anorexia, intermittent abdominal pain, constipation, intermittent vomiting, and peripheral neuropathy (wrist or foot drop).

Acute encephalopathy (usually with levels > 70 μg/dL) is characterized by ↑ ICP, vomiting, confusion, seizures, and coma.

Blood lead level.

CBC and peripheral blood smear show microcytic, hypochromic anemia and basophilic stippling.

< 45 μg/dL and asymptomatic: Retest at 1–3 months; remove sources of lead exposure.

45–69 μg/dL: Chelation therapy (inpatient EDTA or outpatient oral succimer [DMSA]).

≥ 70 μg/dL: Chelation therapy (inpatient EDTA + BAL [IM dimercaprol]).

Buspirone is another drug, in addition to SSRIs, that should not be used with MAOIs.

Many OCD patients initially present to a nonpsychiatrist— e.g., they may consult a dermatologist with a skin complaint 2° to overwashing hands.

Uncontrollable, excessive anxiety or worry about activities or events in life that leads to signifcant impairment or distress.

The male-to-female ratio is 1:2; clinical onset is usually in the early 20s.

Hx/PE: Presents with anxiety on most days (six or more months) and with three or more somatic symptoms (restlessness, fatigue, diff culty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, disturbed sleep).

Tx:

Lifestyle changes, psychotherapy, medication. SSRIs, venlafaxine, and buspirone are most often used (see Table 2.14-1). Benzodiazepines may be used for immediate symptom relief.

General laboratory studies are not specific. Mild to moderate normocytic anemia is common, but frank hemolysis and hemoglobinuria do not develop. Leukocyte counts are usually in the normal range or only slightly elevated, and leukopenia can occur during the crisis. Platelet counts can fall below 50,000/µL. Laboratory evidence of hepatitis can be found, with elevated serum concentrations of unconjugated bilirubin and aminotransferases; the prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times may be moderately prolonged.

Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is indicated in cases of suspected relapsing fever with signs of meningitis or meningoencephalitis. The presence of mononuclear pleocytosis and mildly to moderately elevated protein levels justifies intravenous antibiotic therapy in TBRF.

The manifestations and course of B. miyamotoi infection remain incompletely characterized, but reports to date indicate that the sign most often reported by patients at presentation is fever without respi ratory symptoms starting 1–2 weeks after a tick bite and recurring once or twice in some cases. Meningoencephalitis with spirochetes in the CSF was documented in one immunodeficient adult.

Relapsing fever should be considered in a patient with the characteristic fever pattern and a history of recent exposure—i.e., within 1–2 weeks before illness onset—to body lice or soft-bodied ticks in geographic areas with documented current or past transmission.

Because of the longevity of the ticks and the transovarial transmission of the pathogen in the ticks, a case of relapsing fever may be diagnosed many years after the last case reported in that locale.

2023-11-29 14:12:29,388 query: A 35-year-old man returns to the clinic to follow up for his chronic stomach pain. At the last visit a few months ago, he explained that he had been experiencing discomfort in his upper abdomen for awhile. He had never vomited up any blood and had not had any substantial weight loss. He did not take any medications, did not smoke, and had no family history of gastric cancer. At that time, the doctor empirically started him on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Today, despite the PPI, the patient says he is still experiencing discomfort. Hearing this, the doctor decides to order a urease breath test. What is the most likely cause of this patient's chronic stomach pain?

and some patients with peptic ulcer do not have Helicobacter. This obviously suggests that there are other important pathogenetic factors involved in peptic ulcer. And even in the presence of active H pylori infection, strong acid suppression usually heals peptic ulcer, an observa-tion consistent with the old dictum “no acid, no ulcer.” But suc-cessful helicobacter treatment eliminates ulcer recurrence and the need for long-term PPI. And long-term PPI in patients with active Helicobacter infection may lead to corpus predominant gastritis, which leads to atrophic gastritis and increases the risk of

Patients presenting with the typical symp-toms of heartburn and/or regurgitation which have responded, at least partly, to PPI therapy, will generally do well following surgery, whereas patients with atypical symptoms have a less predictable response. Reflux should also be objectively con-firmed by either the presence of ulcerative esophagitis or an abnormal 24-hour pH study.The propulsive force of the body of the esophagus should be evaluated by esophageal manometry to determine if it has sufficient power to propel a bolus of food through a newly reconstructed valve.

Hepatobiliary disorders, including cholecystitis and biliary colic, may mimic acute cardiopulmonary diseases. Although the pain arising from these disorders usually localizes to the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, it is variable and may be felt in the epigastrium and radiate to the back and lower chest. This discomfort is sometimes referred to the scapula or may in rare cases be felt in the shoulder, suggesting diaphragmatic irritation. The pain is steady, usually lasts several hours, and subsides spontaneously, without symptoms between attacks. Pain resulting from pancreatitis is typically aching epigastric pain that radiates to the back.

Musculoskeletal and Other Causes (See also Chap. 393) Chest discomfort can be produced by any musculoskeletal disorder involving the chest wall or the nerves of the chest wall, neck, or upper limbs.

PART 2 Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases

Costochondritis causing tenderness of the costochondral junctions (Tietze’s syndrome) is relatively common. Cervical radiculitis may manifest as a prolonged or constant aching discomfort in the upper chest and limbs. The pain may be exacerbated by motion of the neck. Occasionally, chest pain can be caused by compression of the brachial plexus by the cervical ribs, and tendinitis or bursitis involving the left shoulder may mimic the radiation of angina. Pain in a dermatomal distribution can also be caused by cramping of intercostal muscles or by herpes zoster (Chap. 217).

Emotional and Psychiatric Conditions As many as 10% of patients who present to emergency departments with acute chest discomfort have a panic disorder or related condition (Table 19-1). The symptoms may include chest tightness or aching that is associated with a sense of anxiety and difficulty breathing. The symptoms may be prolonged or fleeting.

Recommended routine tests at the first prenatal encounter are listed in Table 9-1. Initial blood tests include a complete blood count, a determination of blood type with h status, and an antibody screen. The Institute of Medicine recommends universal human immunodeiciency virus (HIV) testing, with patient notiication and right of refusal, as a routine part of prenatal care. The CDC (Branson, 2006) as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (20 16f, 2017) continue to support this practice. If a woman declines testing, this is recorded in the prenatal record. All pregnant women are also screened for hepatitis B virus infection, syphilis, and immunity to rubella at the initial visit. Based on their prospective investigation of 1000 women, Murray and coworkers (2002) concluded that in the absence of hypertension, routine urinalysis beyond the irst prenatal visit was not necessary. A urine culture is recommended by most because treating bacteruria signiicantly reduces the likelihood of developing symptomatic urinary tract infections in pregnancy (Chap. 53, p. 1026).

Chlamydia trachomatis is isolated from the cervix in 2 to 13 percent of pregnant women. he American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017) recommend that all women be screened for chlamydia during the irst prenatal visit, with additional third-trimester testing for those at increased risk. Risk factors include unmarried status, recent change in sexual partner or multiple concurrent partners, age younger than 25 years, inner-city residence, history or presence of other sexually transmitted diseases, and little or no prenatal care. For those testing positive, treatment described in Chapter 65 (p. 1240) is followed by a second testing-a test of cure-3 to 4 weeks after treatment completion.

Maternal lead exposure has been associated with several adverse maternal and fetal outcomes across a range of maternal blood lead levels (Taylor, 2015). These include gestational hypertension, miscarriage, low birthweight, and neurodevelopmental impairments in exposed pregnancies (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2016c). The levels at which these risks rise remains unclear. However, recognizing that such exposure remains a significant health issue for reproductive-aged women, the CDC (201 Oa) has issued guidance for screening and managing exposed pregnant and lactating women. These guidelines, which have been endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2016c), recommend blood lead testing only if a risk factor is identified. If the levels are > 5 /Lg1 dL, then counseling is completed, and the lead source is sought and removed. Subsequent blood levels are obtained. Blood lead levels >45 Lg/dL are consistent with lead poisoning, and women in this group may be candidates for chelation therapy. Afected pregnancies are best managed in consultation with lead poisoning treatment experts. National and state resources are available at the CDC website: ww.cdc.gov/ncehllead/.

Pregnant women are encouraged to wear properly positioned three-point restraints as protection against automobile crash injury (Chap. 47, p. 927). The lap portion of the restraining belt is placed under the abdomen and across her upper thighs. The belt should be comfortably snug. The shoulder belt also is irmly positioned between the breasts. Airbags should not be disabled for the pregnant woman.

The clinical impetus for screening mammogra-phy came from the Health Insurance Plan study and the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project, which demonstrated a 33% reduction in mortality for women after72 screening mam-mography. Mammography was more accurate than clinical examination for the detection of early breast cancers, providing a true-positive rate of 90%. Only 20% of women with nonpal-pable cancers had axillary lymph node metastases, compared with 50% of women with palpable cancers.141 Current guide-lines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network suggest that normal-risk women ≥20 years of age should have a breast examination at

Congenital CMV infections pose a much greater problem than does rubella. There is no way of identifying the infected fetus prior to birth or to prevent inapparent infections in the pregnant woman. As indicated above, if the pregnant woman has measurable titers of antibodies to CMV at the time of conception, her infant is relatively protected. Moreover, some infected infants (with viruria) may appear normal at birth but develop neural deafness and developmental delay several years later. Viral replication in infected organs continues after the first year and health workers are at risk. A second child may be infected.

There is no known treatment. The difficulties in prenatal diagnosis of maternal infection preclude planned abortion. Routine serologic testing should be done on every young woman of childbearing age. Until an effective vaccine becomes available, pregnancy should be avoided if a sexual partner is infected.

In the United States, approximately 10 percent of cases of AIDS have occurred in women, almost all of them of childbearing age, and the rate of new cases is increasing at a faster rate among them than among men. The numbers are higher in many developing countries. In children, practically all instances of AIDS come from an HIV-infected mother (“vertical transmission”). The infection may be acquired in utero, during delivery, or from breast-feeding. The relative importance of each of these modes of transmission has not been settled.

Although suicidal and homicidal behaviors are absolute indications for referral, many physicians fear that questioning patients about these behaviors will provoke them. That is not the case (12). An open discussion of impulses to hurt oneself or someone else helps the patient to regain control, recognize the need for mental health care, or agree to emergency interventions such as psychiatric hospitalization, whereas avoiding the subject intensifies the patient’s feelings of isolation. The management of suicidal behavior is addressed later in this chapter in the section on mood disorders.

Likewise, the possibility of psychosis need not be avoided. Most patients with psychotic disorders have had previous experience with psychiatric referral. Their psychotic symptoms are often distressing, so treatment is an appealing option (19). They can discuss hallucinations and delusions quite matter-of-factly. The rare patient who comes to a gynecologist in the midst of a first episode of psychosis is likely to be frightened by her symptoms and willing to accept expert consultation.

Despite increasing public sophistication about mental illnesses and psychiatric care, some patients believe that any mention of mental health intervention implies that they are either “crazy” or that the referring physician is convinced that their physical symptoms are imaginary or feigned. It is helpful to state explicitly that this is not the case. Making the real reason for the referral clear and founded in signs and symptoms obvious to the patient will nearly always allay anxiety over a psychiatric referral (19).

It is not acceptable to refer a patient to a psychiatrist without informing her in advance and obtaining her consent, unless she is acutely psychotic, functionally incompetent, or in the throes of a suicidal or homicidal emergency. Even under those circumstances, it is highly preferable to be straightforward. A referral that begins with an unexpected clinical encounter with a psychiatrist is unfair to both the psychiatrist and the patient and is unlikely to result in a satisfactory outcome (17–19).

Individuals with histrionic personality disorder may have difficulty achieving emotional in- timacy in romantic or sexual relationships. Without being aware of it, they often act out a role (e.g., ”victim” or ”princess”) in their relationships to others. They may seek to control their partner through emotional manipulation or seductiveness on one level, while display- ing a marked dependency on them at another level. Individuals with this disorder often have impaired relationships with same—sex friends because their sexually provocative inter- personal style may seem a threat to their friends’ relationships. These individuals may also alienate friends with demands for constant attention. They often become depressed and up- set when they are not the center of attention. They may crave novelty, stimulation, and ex- citement and have a tendency to become bored with their usual routine. These individuals are often intolerant of, or frustrated by, situations that involve delayed gratification, and their actions are often directed at obtaining immediate satisfaction. Although they often ini- tiate a job or project with great enthusiasm, their interest may lag quickly. Longer-term re- lationships may be neglected to make way for the excitement of new relationships.

The actual risk of suicide is not known, but clinical experience suggests that individu- als with this disorder are at increased risk for suicidal gestures and threats to get attention and coerce better caregiving. Histrionic personality disorder has been associated with higher rates of somatic symptom disorder, conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder), and major depressive disorder. Borderline, narcissistic, antisocial, and dependent personality disorders often co—occur.

Data from the 2001—2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Condi- tions suggest a prevalence of histrionic personality of 1.84%.

Norms for interpersonal behavior, personal appearance, and emotional expressiveness vary widely across cultures, genders, and age groups. Before considering the various traits (e.g., emotionality, seductiveness, dramatic interpersonal style, novelty seeking, sociabil- ity, charm, impressionability, a tendency to somatization) to be evidence of histrionic per- sonality disorder, it is important to evaluate whether they cause clinically significant impairment or distress.

A physician who refers patients to a psychiatrist should know not only when doing so is appropriate but also how to refer, because societal misconceptions and the stigma of mental illness impede the process. Primary care physicians should base referrals to a psychiatrist on the presence of signs and symptoms of a mental disorder and not simply on the absence of a physical explanation for a patient’s complaint. The physician should discuss with the patient the reasons for requesting the referral or consultation and provide reassurance that he or she will continue to provide medical care and work collaboratively with the mental health professional. Consultation with a psychiatrist or transfer of care is appropriate when physicians encounter evidence of psychotic symptoms, mania, severe depression, or anxiety; symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); suicidal or homicidal preoccupation; or a failure to respond to first-order treatment. This chapter reviews the clinical assessment and treatment of some of the most common mental disorders presenting in primary care and is based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), the framework for categorizing psychiatric illness used in the United States. Eating disorders are discussed later in this chapter, and the biology of psychiatric and addictive disorders is discussed in Chap. 465e.

There is always a tendency to assume that mental function is normal if a patient complains only of anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, or vague somatic symptoms, and to label the patient as anxious. This will be avoided if one keeps in mind that these psychiatric disorders rarely have their onset in middle or late adult life.

Clues to the diagnosis of depression are the presence of frequent sighing, crying, loss of energy, psychomotor underactivity or its opposite, agitation with pacing, persecutory delusions, hypochondriasis, and a history of depression in the past and in the family. Although depressed patients may complain of memory failure, scrutiny of their complaints will show that they can usually remember the details of their illness and that little or no qualitative change in other intellectual functions has taken place. Their difficulty is either a lack of energy and interest or preoccupation with personal worries and anxiety, which prevents the focusing of attention on anything except their own problems. Even during mental tests, their performance may be impaired by “emotional blocking,” in much the same way as the worried student blocks during an examination. When such patients are calmed by reassurance and encouraged to try harder, their mental function improves, indicating that intellectual deterioration has not occurred. Conversely, it is helpful to remember that demented patients in the mid-stages of the process infrequently have sufficient insight to complain of mental deterioration; if they admit to poor memory, they do so without conviction or full appreciation of the degree of their disability. The physician must not rely on the patient’s statements alone in gauging the efficiency of mental function and should seek corroboration from family members. Yet another problem is that of the impulsive, cantankerous, and quarrelsome patient who is a constant source of distress to employer and family. Such changes in personality and behavior (as, e.g., in Huntington disease) may precede or mask early intellectual deterioration.

Patients typically have multiple somatic complaints, frequent ER visits, and unexplained injuries with delayed medical treatment. They may also avoid eye contact or act afraid or hostile.

Children may exhibit precocious sexual behavior, genital or anal trauma, STDs, UTIs, and psychiatric problems.

Other clues include a partner who answers questions for the patient or refuses to leave the exam room.

Tx: Perform a screening assessment of the patient’s safety domestically and in their close personal relationships. Provide medical care, emotional support, and counseling; educate the patient about support services and refer appropriately. Documentation is crucial.

Accounts for 30,000 deaths per year in the United States; the eighth overall cause of death in the United States. One suicide occurs every 20 minutes.

Risk factors include male gender, age greater than 45 years, psychiatric disorders (major depression, presence of psychotic symptoms), a history of an admission to a psychiatric institution, a previous suicide attempt, a history of violent behavior, ethanol or substance abuse, recent severe stressors, and a family suicide history (see the mnemonic SAD PERSONS).

Women are more likely to attempt suicide, whereas men are more likely to succeed by virtue of their ↑ use of more lethal methods.

Dx:

Perform a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation.

Ask about family history, previous attempts, ambivalence toward death, and hopelessness.

Ask directly about suicidal ideation, intent, and plan, and look for available means.

Tx: A patient who endorses suicidality requires emergent inpatient hospitalization even against his will. Suicide risk may ↑ after antidepressant therapy is initiated because a patient’s energy to act on suicidal thoughts can return before the depressed mood lifts.

The opioid antagonist naloxone may be given in a dose of 0.4–2 mg intravenously. Naloxone reverses respiratory and CNS depression due to all varieties of opioid drugs (see Chapter 31). It is useful to remember that these drugs cause death primarily by respiratory depression; therefore, if airway and breathing assistance have already been instituted, naloxone may not be necessary. Larger doses of naloxone may be needed for patients with overdose involving propoxyphene, codeine, and some other opioids. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (see Chapter 22) may be of value in patients with suspected benzodiazepine overdose, but it should not be used if there is a history of tricyclic antidepressant overdose or a seizure disorder, as it can induce convulsions in such patients.

Once the essential initial ABCD interventions have been instituted, one can begin a more detailed evaluation to make a specific diagnosis. This includes gathering any available history and performing a toxicologically oriented physical examination. Other causes of coma or seizures such as head trauma, meningitis, or metabolic abnormalities should be sought and treated.

Some common intoxications are described under Common Toxic Syndromes.

A. History

Oral statements about the amount and even the type of drug ingested in toxic emergencies may be unreliable. Even so, family members, police, and fire department or paramedical personnel should be asked to describe the environment in which the toxic emergency occurred and should bring to the emergency department any syringes, empty bottles, household products, or overthe-counter medications in the immediate vicinity of the possibly poisoned patient.

B. Physical Examination

A brief examination should be performed, emphasizing those areas most likely to give clues to the toxicologic diagnosis. These include vital signs, eyes and mouth, skin, abdomen, and nervous system.

About 20–25% of exposures require bedside health-professional evaluation, and 5% of all exposures require hospitalization. Poisonings account for 5–10% of all ambulance transports, emergency department visits, and intensive care unit admissions. Up to 30% of psychiatric admissions are prompted by attempted suicide via overdosage. Overall, the mortality rate is low: <1% of all exposures. It is much higher (1–2%) among hospitalized patients with intentional (suicidal) overdose, who account for the majority of serious poisonings. Acetaminophen is the pharmaceutical agent most often implicated in fatal poisoning. Overall, carbon monoxide is the leading cause of death from poisoning, but this prominence is not reflected in hospital or poison center statistics because patients with such poisoning are typically dead when discovered and are referred directly to medical examiners.

Although poisoning can mimic other illnesses, the correct diagnosis can usually be established by the history, physical examination, routine and toxicologic laboratory evaluations, and characteristic clinical course.

The history should include the time, route, duration, and circumstances (location, surrounding events, and intent) of exposure; the name and amount of each drug, chemical, or ingredient involved; the time of onset, nature, and severity of symptoms; the time and type of first-aid measures provided; and the medical and psychiatric history.

Pneumonia Pneumonia is defined as inﬂammation of the distal lung that includes terminal airways, alveolar spaces, and the interstitium. Pneumonia may have multiple causes, including viral and bacterial infections or aspiration. Aspiration pneumonia is usually the result of depressed awareness commonly associated with the use of drugs and alcohol or anesthesia. Viral pneumonias are caused by multiple infectious agents, including inﬂuenza A or B, parainﬂuenza virus, or respiratory syncytial virus. Most viral syndromes are spread by aerosolization associated with coughing, sneezing, and even conversation. Incubation is short, requiring only 1 to 3 days before the acute onset of fever, chills, headache, fatigue, and myalgias. Symptom intensity is directly related to intensity of the host febrile reaction. Pneumonia develops in only 1% of patients who have a viral syndrome, but mortality rates may reach 30% in immunocompromised individuals and the elderly. An additional risk is the development of secondary bacterial pneumonias after the initial viral insult. These infections are more common in elderly patients and may explain the high fatality in this group (8). Staphylococcal pneumonias, which often arise from a previous viral infection, are extremely lethal regardless of patient age. The best treatment for viral pneumonia is prevention by immunization. Treatment is supportive and consists mostly of administration of antipyretics and ﬂuids.

Bacterial pneumonia is classified as either community acquired or nosocomial, and in many cases the classification determines prognosis and antibiotic therapy. Risk factors that contribute to mortality are chronic cardiopulmonary diseases, alcoholism, diabetes, renal failure, malignancy, and malnutrition. Prognostic features associated with poor outcome include greater than two lobe involvement, respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths per minute on presentation, severe hypoxemia (<60 mm Hg on room air), hypoalbuminemia, and septicemia. Pneumonia is a common cause of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a mortality rate between 50% and 70% (9,10).

In the clinic

Pulled elbow is a disorder that typically occurs in children under 5 years of age. It is commonly caused by a sharp pull of the child’s hand, usually when the child is pulled up a curb. The not-yet-developed head of the radius and the laxity of the anular ligament of the radius allow the head to sublux from this cuff of tissue. Pulled elbow is extremely painful, but can be treated easily by simple supination and compression of the elbow joint by the clinician. When the radial head is relocated the pain subsides immediately and the child can continue with normal activity.

In the clinic

Fracture of the olecranon

Fractures of the olecranon can result from a direct blow to the olecranon or from a fall onto an outstretched hand (Fig. 7.74). The triceps inserts into the olecranon and injuries can cause avulsion of the muscle.

In the clinic

Developmental changes in the elbow joint

The elbow joint can be injured in many ways; the types of injuries are age dependent. When a fracture or soft tissue trauma is suspected, a plain lateral and an anteroposterior radiograph are obtained. In an adult it is usually not difficult to interpret the radiograph, but in children additional factors require interpretation.

As the elbow develops in children, numerous secondary ossification centers appear before and around puberty. It is easy to mistakenly interpret these as fractures. In addition, it is also possible for the epiphyses and apophyses to be “pulled off” or disrupted. Therefore, when interpreting a child’s radiograph of the elbow, the physician must know the child’s age (Fig. 7.75). Fusion occurs at around the time of puberty. An understanding of the normal epiphyses and apophyses and their normal relationship to the bones will secure a correct diagnosis. The approximate ages of appearance of the secondary ossification centers around the elbow joint are: capitulum—1 year, head (of radius)—5 years, medial epicondyle—5 years, trochlea—11 years, olecranon—12 years, and lateral epicondyle—13 years.

Fracture of the head of the radius

In most patients, the condition improves spontaneously 1–3 years after onset. While pain usually improves, many patients are left with some limitation of shoulder motion. Early mobilization of the arm following an injury to the shoulder may prevent the development of this disease. Physical therapy provides the foundation of treatment for adhesive capsulitis. Local injections of glucocorticoids and NSAIDs may also provide relief of symptoms. Slow but forceful injection of contrast material into the joint may lyse adhesions and stretch the capsule, resulting in improvement of shoulder motion. Manipulation under anesthesia may be helpful in some patients.

Lateral epicondylitis, or tennis elbow, is a painful condition involving the soft tissue over the lateral aspect of the elbow. The pain originates ator near the siteof attachment of the commonextensorsto the lateral epicondyle and may radiate into the forearm and dorsum of the wrist. The pain usually appears after work or recreational activities involving repeated motions of wrist extension and supination against resistance. Most patients with this disorder injure themselves in activities other than tennis, such as pulling weeds, carrying suitcases or briefcases, or using a screwdriver. The injury in tennis usually occurs when hitting a backhand with the elbow flexed. Shaking hands and opening doors can reproduce the pain. Striking the lateral elbow against a solid object may also induce pain.

document (2) 

The next step in the examination is observation of the spine, hips, and legs during certain motions. No advantage accrues from determining how much pain the patient can tolerate. More important is to determine when and under what conditions the pain begins or worsens. Observation of the patient’s gait may disclose a subtle limp, a pelvic tilt, a shortening of step, or a stiffness of bearing—indicative of a disinclination to bear weight on a painful leg. One looks for limitation of motion while the patient is standing, sitting, and reclining. When standing, the motion of forward bending normally produces flattening and reversal of the lumbar lordotic curve and exaggeration of the thoracic curve. With lesions of the lumbosacral region that involve the posterior ligaments, articular facets, or sacrospinalis muscles and with ruptured lumbar discs, protective reflexes prevent flexion, which stretches these structures (“splinting”). As a consequence, the sacrospinalis muscles remain taut and prevent motion in the lumbar part of the spine. Forward bending then occurs at the hips and at the thoracolumbar junction; also, the patient bends in such a way as to avoid tensing the hamstring muscles and putting undue leverage on the pelvis. In the presence of degenerative disc disease, straightening up from a flexed position is performed with difficulty.

Lateral bending is usually less instructive than forward bending but, in unilateral ligamentous or muscular strain, bending to the opposite side aggravates the pain by stretching the damaged tissues. With unilateral sciatica, the patient lists to one side and strongly resists bending to the opposite side, and the preferred posture in standing is with the leg slightly flexed at the hip and knee. When the herniated disc lies lateral to the nerve root and displaces it medially, tension on the root is reduced and pain is relieved by bending the trunk to the side opposite the lesion; with herniation medial to the root, tension is reduced by inclining the trunk to the side of the lesion.

Injuries in a Pediatric PatientLong bone diaphyseal fractures are generally treated closed. Pediatric patients are capable of extensive remodeling so that an angular deformity within the plane of an adjacent joint is often completely remodeled by the growth of the child. Older children do not remodel as well. A 10° angulation in both bones of the forearm in a child over an age of 10 years may cause significant limitation of rotation of the forearm. When internal fixation of a diaphyseal fracture is required, fixation through the physis is avoided.Fractures of the Pediatric HipFractures of the pediatric

The early detection of cerebral palsy is hampered by the fact that the corticospinal tract is not fully myelinated until 18 months of age, allowing only quasivoluntary movements up to this time. For this reason, a congenital hemiparesis may not be evident until many months after birth. Even then it is manifest only by subtle signs, such as holding the hand in a fisted posture or clumsiness in reaching for objects and in transferring them from one hand to the other. Later, the leg is seen to be less active as the infant crawls, steps, and places the foot. Early hand dominance should always raise the suspicion of a motor defect on the opposite side. In the upper limb, the characteristic catch and yielding resistance of spasticity is most evident in passive abduction of the arm, extension of the elbow, dorsiflexion of the wrist, and supination of the forearm; in the leg, the change in tone is best detected by passive flexion of the knee. However, the time of appearance and degree of spasticity are variable from child to child. The stretch reflexes are hyperactive, and the plantar reflex may be extensor on the affected side. With bilateral hemiplegia, the same abnormalities are detectable, but there is a greater likelihood of pseudobulbar manifestations, with delayed, poorly enunciated speech.

Later, intelligence is likely to be impaired (in 40 percent of hemiplegias and 70 percent of bilateral hemiplegias). In diparesis or diplegia, hypotonia gives way to spasticity and the same delay in motor development except that it predominates in the legs. Aside from the hereditary spastic paraplegias, which may become evident in the second and third years, the common causes of weak spastic legs are prematurity and matrix hemorrhages. These various forms of cerebral palsy are described in Chap. 37.

dislocation of the hips is noted at birth (arthrogryposis and its differential diagnosis is discussed in Chap. 45 in the section on the congenital neuromuscular disorders). The muscle weakness in these children is generalized from the beginning, and death comes early, usually within the first year. Other infants seem to develop normally for several months before the weakness becomes apparent. In these, the trunk, pelvic, and shoulder-girdle muscles are at first disproportionately affected, while the fingers and hands, toes and feet, and cranial muscles retain mobility. Hypotonia accompanies the weakness, and because passive displacement

Lesions of the vestibular component of cranial nerve VIII produce symptoms of vertigo, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, and nystagmus. Nystagmus is an involuntary beating eye movement with a rapid phase in one direction and a slow phase in the opposite direction. By convention, the direction of the nystagmus is defined by the fast phase and may be horizontal, vertical, or rotatory.

The gag reflex is brisk at all ages except the very immature neonate. An absent gag reflex suggests a lower motor neuron lesion of the brainstem, cranial nerves IX or X, neuromuscular junction, or pharyngeal muscles. Weak, breathy, or nasal speech; weak sucking; drooling and inability to handle secretions; gagging and nasal regurgitation of food are additional symptoms of cranial nerve X dysfunction.

Observing the infant’s posture and spontaneous activity assesses the functions of the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles. Head tilt and drooping of the shoulder suggest lesions involving cranial nerve XI. In later childhood, strength in these muscles can be tested directly and individually.

Atrophy and fasciculation of the tongue, usually indicating a lesion of the anterior horn cells (spinal muscular atrophy [SMA]), can be observed at any age and are assessed most reliably when the infant is asleep. The tongue deviates toward the weak side in unilateral lesions.

In infants, power is assessed by observation of spontaneous movements and movements against gravity. Arm and leg movements should be symmetrical, seen best when the infant is held supine with one hand supporting the buttocks and one supporting the shoulders. The limbs should easily lift up. Power is graded as follows: 5 Normal 4 Weak but able to provide resistance 3 Able to move against gravity but not against resistance 2 Unable to move against gravity

and because passive displacement of articulated parts in testing muscle tone is easier to judge than power of contraction at this early age, it may be singled out as the dominant clinical characteristic. As a rule, the tendon reflexes are unobtainable. Volume of muscle is diminished but is difficult to evaluate in the infant because of the coverings of adipose tissue. Fasciculations are seldom visible except sometimes in the tongue. Perception of tactile and painful stimuli is undiminished, and emotional and social development measures up to age.

Transition from the embryonic period to the fetal period occurs at 7 weeks after fertilization, corresponding to 9 weeks after onset of the last menses. At this time, the fetus approximates 24 mm in length, most organ systems have developed, and the fetus enters a period of growth and maturation. These phases are outlined in Figure 7-2.

The uterus usually is just palpable above the symphysis pubis. Fetal growth is rapid, and the fetal crown-rump length is 5 to 6 cm (Fig. 7-7). Centers of ossiication have appeared in most fetal bones, and the fingers and toes have become diferentiated. Skin and nails develop, and scattered rudiments of hair appear. he external genitalia are beginning to show deinitive signs of male or female gender. he fetus begins to make spontaneous movements.

Fetal growth slows at this time. The crown-rump length is 12 cm, and the fetal weight approximates 150 g (Hadlock, 1991). Practically speaing, the sonographic crown-rump length is not measured beyond 13 weeks, which corresponds to approximately 8.4 cm. Instead, biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length are measured. Fetal weight in the second and third trimesters is estimated from a combination of these measurements (Chap. 10, p. 184).

Eye movements begin at 16 to 18 weeks, coinciding with midbrain maturation. By 18 weeks in the female fetus, the uterus is formed and vaginal canalization begins. By 20 weeks in the male, testicles start to descend.

FIGURE 7-7 This image of a 12-week, 3-day embryo depicts measurement of the crown-rump length. The fetal profile, cranium, and a hand and foot are also visible in this image.

The first physical examination of a newborn may be a general physical examination of a well infant or an examination to confirm fetal diagnoses or to determine the cause of various manifestations of neonatal diseases. Problems in the transition from fetal to neonatal life may be detectable immediately in the delivery room or during the first day of life. Physical examination also may reveal effects of the labor and delivery resulting from asphyxia, drugs, or birth trauma. The first newborn examination is an important way to detect congenital malformations or deformations (Table 58-9). Significant congenital malformations may be present in 1% to 3% of all births.

Signs such as cyanosis, nasal flaring, intercostal retractions, and grunting suggest pulmonary disease. Meconium staining of the umbilical cord, nails, and skin suggest fetal distress and the possibility of aspiration pneumonia. The level of spontaneous activity, passive muscle tone, quality of the cry, and apnea are useful screening signs to evaluate the state of the nervous system.

The examination should proceed with an assessment of vital signs, particularly heart rate (normal rate, 120 to 160 beats/min); respiratory rate (normal rate, 30 to 60 breaths/min); temperature (usually done per rectum and later as an axillary measurement); and blood pressure (often reserved for sick infants). Length, weight, and head circumference should be measured and plotted on growth curves to determine whether growth is normal, accelerated, or retarded for the specific gestational age.

This is the midpoint of pregnancy as estimated from the LMP. The fetus now weighs somewhat more than 300 g, and weight increases substantially in a linear manner. From this point onward, the fetus moves approximately every minute and is active 10 to 30 percent of the day (DiPietro, 2005). Brown fat forms, and the fetal skin becomes less transparent. Downy lanugo covers its entire body, and some scalp hair can be seen. Cochlear function develops between 22 and 25 weeks, and its maturation continues for 6 months after delivery.

The fetus now weighs almost 700 g (Duryea, 2014). he skin is characteristically wrinkled, and fat deposition begins. The head is still comparatively large, and eyebrows and eyelashes are usually recognizable. By 24 weeks, the secretory type II pneumocytes have initiated surfactant secretion (Chap. 32, p. 607). The canalicular period of lung development, during which the bronchi and bronchioles enlarge and alveolar ducts develop, is nearly completed. Despite this, a fetus born at this time will attempt to breathe, but many will die because the terminal sacs, required for gas exchange, have not yet formed. The overall survival rate at 24 weeks is barely above 50 percent, and only approximately 30 percent survive without severe morbidity (Rysavy, 2015). By 26 weeks, the eyes open. Nociceptors are present over all the body, and the neural pain system is developed (Kadic, 2012). The fetal liver and spleen are important sites for hemopoiesis.

The crown-rump length approximates 25 cm, and the fetus weighs about 1100 g. The thin skin is red and covered with vernix caseosa. The pupillary membrane has just disappeared from the eyes. Isolated eye blinking peaks at 28 weeks. The bone marrow becomes the major site of hemopoiesis. he otherwise normal neonate born at this age has a 90-percent chance of survival.without physical or neurological impairment.

Gestational age (GA): The number of weeks and days measured from the frst day of the last menstrual period (LMP). GA can also be determined by:

Fundal height: At 20 weeks, the uterus is at the umbilicus and grows approximately 1 cm/week.

Quickening, or appreciation of fetal movement: Typically occurs at 17–18 weeks.

Fetal heart tones: Can be heard at 10–12 weeks by Doppler.

Ultrasound: Measures fetal crown-rump length (CRL) at 5–12 weeks and measures biparietal diameter (BPD), femur length (FL), and abdominal circumference (AC) from 13 weeks. Ultrasound measurement of GA is most reliable during the f rst trimester.

Fibroadenoma Fibroadenomas are the most common benign tumors of the breast. In one series, they accounted for 50% of all breast biopsies (141). They usually occur in young women (age 20 to 35 years) and may occur in teenagers (142). In women younger than 25 years, fibroadenomas are more common than cysts. They rarely occur after menopause, although occasionally they are found, often calcified, in postmenopausal women. For this reason, it is postulated that fibroadenomas are responsive to estrogen stimulation. A study reports the de novo occurrence of fibroadenoma in 51 women older than age 35 years who had no evidence of a palpable or mammographic visualized lesion in well-documented prior visits (143). Fibroadenomas may appear as single masses or as multiple lesions.

Clinically, a young woman usually notices a mass while showering or dressing. Most masses are 2 to 3 cm in diameter when detected, but they can become extremely large (i.e., the giant fibroadenoma). On physical examination, they are firm, smooth, and rubbery. They do not elicit an inﬂammatory reaction, are freely mobile, and cause no dimpling of the skin or nipple retraction. They are often bilobed, and a groove can be palpated on examination. On mammographic and ultrasonographic imaging, the typical features are of a well-defined, smooth, solid mass with clearly defined margins and dimensions that are longer than wide and craniocaudad dimensions that are less than the length.

Most episodes of fever in children younger than 3 years of age have a demonstrable source of infection elicited by history, physical examination, or a simple laboratory test. In this age group, the most commonly identified serious bacterial infection is a UTI. A blood culture to evaluate for occult bacteremia, and urinalysis and urine culture to evaluate for a UTI, should be considered for all children younger than 3 years of age with fever without localizing signs. Stool culture should be obtained in those with diarrhea marked by blood or mucous. Ill-appearing children should be admitted to the hospital and treated with empirical antibiotics.

Approximately 0.2% of well-appearing febrile children 3 to 36 months of age vaccinated against S. pneumoniae and

H. influenzae and without localizing signs have occult bacteremia. Risk factors for occult bacteremia include temperature of 102.2° F (39° C) or greater, WBC count of 15,000/mm3 or more, and elevated absolute neutrophil count, band count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or C-reactive protein. No combination of demographic factors (socioeconomic status, race, gender, and age), clinical parameters, or laboratory tests in these children reliably predicts occult bacteremia.

Chest pain in the pediatric patient often generates a significant amount of patient and parental concern. Although chest pain is rarely cardiac in origin in children, common knowledge about atherosclerotic heart disease raises concerns about a child experiencing chest pain. Most diagnosable chest pain in childhood is musculoskeletal in origin. A significant amount

remains idiopathic, however. Knowledge of the complete differential diagnosis is necessary to make an accurate assessment (Table 141-1).

Assessment of a patient with chest pain includes a thorough history to determine activity at the onset; the location, radiation, quality, and duration of the pain; what makes the pain better and worse during the time that it is present; and any associated symptoms. A family history and assessment of how much anxiety the symptom is causing are important and often revealing. A careful general physical examination should focus on the chest wall, heart, lungs, and abdomen. A history of chest pain associated with exertion, syncope, or palpitations or acute onset associated with fever suggests a cardiac etiology. Cardiac causes of chest pain are generally ischemic, inflammatory, or arrhythmic in origin.

Tests rarely are indicated based on the history. A chest x-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG), 24-hour Holter monitoring, echo-cardiogram, and exercise stress testing may be obtained based on history and examination. Referral to a pediatric cardiologist is based on the history, physical examination findings, family history, and, frequently, the level of anxiety in the patient or family members regarding the pain.

Substernal chest pain 2° to myocardial ischemia (O2 supply and demand mismatch). Prinzmetal’s (variant) angina mimics angina pectoris but is caused by vasospasm of coronary vessels. It classically affects young women at rest in the early morning and is associated with ST-segment elevation in the absence of cardiac enzyme elevation.

The classic triad consists of substernal chest pain or pressure (often described as a heaviness or pressure without pain), usually precipitated by stress or exertion and relieved by rest or nitrates.

Pain can radiate to the left arm, jaw, and neck and may be associated with shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, diaphoresis, or lightheadedness.

Examination of patients experiencing stable angina is generally unremarkable. Look for carotid and peripheral bruits suggesting atherosclerosis and hypertension.

Rule out pulmonary, GI, or other cardiac causes of chest pain.

Angina may be diagnosed from the history alone, but significant ST-segment changes on exercise stress test with ECG monitoring is diagnostic of CAD.

Women and diabetics classically experience “silent” ischemic events and present “atypically”; for this reason, it is necessary to maintain a high index of suspicion in this patient population.

Treat acute symptoms with ASA, O2 and/or IV nitroglycerin, and IV morphine, and consider IV β-blockers. The efficacy of nondihydropyridine CCBs (diltiazem, verapamil) and ACEIs has also been validated.

Patients with a suspected MI must be admitted and monitored until acute MI is ruled out by serial cardiac enzymes.

Treat chronic symptoms with nitrates, ASA, and β-blockers; CCBs are second-line agents for symptomatic control only.

Initiate risk factor reduction (e.g., smoking, cholesterol, hypertension). Hormone replacement therapy is not protective in postmenopausal women.

Women, diabetics, the elderly, and post–heart transplant patients may have atypical, clinically silent MIs.

Electrocardiographic The most widely used test for both the diagnosis of IHD and the estimation of risk and prognosis involves recording the 12-lead ECG before, during, and after exercise, usually on a treadmill (Fig. 293-2). The test consists of a standardized incremental increase in external workload (Table 293-2) while symptoms, the ECG, and arm blood pressure are monitored. Exercise duration is usually symptom-limited, and the test is discontinued upon evidence of chest discomfort, severe shortness of breath, dizziness, severe fatigue, ST-segment depression >0.2 mV (2 mm), a fall in systolic blood pressure >10 mmHg, or the development of a ventricular tachyarrhythmia. This test is used to discover any limitation in exercise performance, detect typical ECG signs of myocardial ischemia, and establish their relationship to chest discomfort. The ischemic ST-segment response generally is defined as flat or downsloping depression of the ST segment >0.1 mV below baseline (i.e., the PR segment) and lasting longer than 0.08 s (Fig. 293-1). Upsloping or junctional ST-segment changes are not considered characteristic of ischemia and do not constitute a positive test. Although T-wave abnormalities, conduction disturbances, and ventricular arrhythmias that develop during exercise should be noted, they are also not diagnostic. Negative exercise tests in which the target heart rate (85% of maximal predicted heart rate for age and sex) is not achieved are considered nondiagnostic.

In interpreting ECG stress tests, the probability that coronary artery disease (CAD) exists in the patient or population under study (i.e., pretest probability) should be considered. Overall, false-positive or false-negative results occur in one-third of cases. However, a positive result on exercise indicates that the likelihood of CAD is 98% in males who are >50 years with a history of typical angina pectoris and who develop chest discomfort during the test. The likelihood decreases if the patient has atypical or no chest pain by history and/or during the test.

document (3) 

History and Physical Examination The chest discomfort, often severe enough to be described as frank pain, is typically located in the sub-sternal region or sometimes in the epigastrium, and radiates to the left arm, left shoulder, and/or neck. Anginal “equivalents” such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension.

Electrocardiogram ST-segment depression occurs in 20 to 25% of patients; it may be transient in patients without biomarker evidence of myocardial necrosis, but may be persistent for several days in NSTEMI. T-wave changes are common but are less specific signs of ischemia, unless they are new and deep T-wave inversions (≥0.3 mV).

Maternal rubella is usually a mild febrile illness with a generalized maculopapular rash beginning on the face and spreading to the trunk and extremities. hat said, 25 to 50 percent of infections are asymptomatic. Other symptoms may include arthralgias or arthritis, head and neck lymphadenopathy, and conjunctivitis. he incubation period is 12 to 23 days. Viremia usually precedes clinical signs by about a week, and adults are infectious during viremia and through 7 days after the rash appears. Up to half of maternal infections are subclinical despite viremia that may cause devastating fetal infection (McLean, 2013).

Rubella virus may be isolated from the urine, blood, nasopharynx, and cerebrospinal fluid for up to 2 weeks after rash onset. The diagnosis is usually made, however, with serological analysis. In one study, 6 percent of nonimmune women seroconverted to rubella virus during pregnancy (Hutton, 2014). Specific IgM antibody can be detected using enzyme-linked immunoassay for 4 to 5 days after onset of clinical disease, but antibody can persist for up to 6 weeks after appearance of the rash. Importantly, rubella virus reinfection can give rise to transient low levels of IgM. With this, fetal infection can rarely occur, but no adverse fetal efects have been described. Serum IgG antibody titers peak 1 to 2 weeks after rash onset. his rapid antibody response may complicate serodiagnosis unless samples are initially collected within a few days after the onset of the rash. If, for example, the first specimen was obtained 10 days after the rash, detection of IgG antibodies would fail to diferentiate between very recent disease and preexisting immunity to rubella. IgG avidity testing is performed concomitant with the serological tests above. High-avidity IgG antibodies indicate an infection at least 2 months in the past.

Infections in dichorionic twins most 1ikely are nonconcordant (Egana-U grinovic, 2016).

Routine prenatal CMV serological screening is currently not recommended by the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (2016). An algorithm for management is shown in Figure 64-2. Pregnant women should be tested for CMV if they present with a mononucleosis-like illness or if congenital infection is suspected based on abnormal sonographic indings. Primary infection is diagnosed using CMV-speciic IgG testing of paired acute and convalescent sera. CMV IgM does not accurately relect timing of seroconversion because IgM antibody levels may be elevated for more than a year (Stagno, 1985). Moreover, CMV IgM may be found with reactivation disease or reinfection with a new strain. Thus, specific CMV IgG avidity testing is valuable

The incubation period for postnatal rubella is typically 16 to18 days (range, 14 to 21 days). The mild catarrhal symptomsof the prodromal phase of rubella may go unnoticed. The characteristic signs of rubella are retroauricular, posterior cervical,and posterior occipital lymphadenopathy accompanied by anerythematous, maculopapular, discrete rash. The rash beginson the face and spreads to the body, lasting for 3 days and lessprominent than that of measles. Rose-colored spots on the softpalate, known as Forchheimer spots, develop in 20% of patientsand may appear before the rash. Other manifestations of rubellainclude mild pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, anorexia, headache,malaise, and low-grade fever. Polyarthritis, usually of the hands,may occur, especially among adult females, but usually resolveswithout sequelae. Paresthesias and tendinitis may occur.

Routine laboratory findings are nonspecific and generally do not aid in diagnosis. The white blood cell count usually is normal or low, and thrombocytopenia rarely occurs. Diagnosis is confirmed by serologic testing for IgM antibodies (typically positive 5 days after symptom onset) or by a fourfold or greater increase in specific IgG antibodies in paired acute and convalescent sera. CRS cases can have detectable IgM until 3 months of age, and stable or rising IgG titers over the first 7 to 11 months of age. False-positive IgM results can occur. Cases of suspected congenital rubella syndrome and postnatal rubella infection should be reported to the local and state health department.

The rash must be differentiated from measles, roseola, enteroviral or adenoviral infection, infectious mononucleosis, toxoplasmosis, scarlet fever, rickettsial disease, Kawasaki disease, serum sickness, and drug rash.

There is no specific therapy for rubella. Routine supportive care includes maintaining adequate hydration and antipyretics.

Thrombocytopenia with purpura/ stenosis) petechiae (e.g., dermal erythropoiesis, or “blueberry muffin syndrome”) Eye defects (cataracts, cloudy cornea, microphthalmos, pigmentary reti-Hemolytic anemia nopathy, congenital glaucoma) Bony radiolucencies Microcephaly Intrauterine growth retardation Central nervous system sequelae Adenopathy (mental and motor delay, autism) Meningoencephalitis clinical presentations, and the high rates of subclinical and mild disease. Illnesses that may be similar to rubella in presentation include scarlet fever, roseola, toxoplasmosis, fifth disease, measles, and illnesses with suboccipital and postauricular lymphadenopathy. Thus laboratory documentation of rubella virus infection is considered the only reliable way to confirm acute disease.

Laboratory assessment of rubella infection is conducted by serologic and virologic methods. For acquired rubella, serologic diagnosis is most common and depends on the demonstration of IgM antibodies in an acute-phase serum specimen or a fourfold rise in IgG antibody titer between acuteand convalescent-phase specimens. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay IgM capture technique is considered most accurate for serologic diagnosis, but the indirect IgM assay also is acceptable. After rubella virus infection, IgM antibody may be detectable for up to 6 weeks. In case of a negative result for IgM in specimens taken earlier than day 5 after rash onset, serologic testing should be repeated. Although uncommon, reinfection with rubella virus is possible, and IgM antibodies may be present. To detect a rise in IgG antibody titer indicative of acute disease, the acute-phase serum specimen should be collected within 7–10 days after onset of illness and the convalescent-phase specimen ~14–21 days after the first specimen.

Wet mount microscopic examination, prepared by mixing vaginal secretions with normal saline solution, and culture may be used to confirm a specific diagnosis (see Table 115-1).Clue cells are vaginal epithelial cells that are covered with G. vaginalis and have a granular appearance. Vaginal cultures for

G. vaginalis are not useful. Candida may be identified by saline wet mount or by culture.

Noninfectious causes of vulvovaginitis include physicalagents (foreign body, sand), chemical agents (bubble bath,soap, detergent), and vulvar skin disease (atopic dermatitis, seborrhea, psoriasis). Physiologic vaginal discharge orphysiologic leukorrhea of desquamated vaginal cells andmucus occurs normally in girls soon after birth, with discharge lasting for about 1 week, and appears again at 6 to 12months before menarche. The discharge is minimal, clear,and thin without pruritus or inflammation. No treatment is necessary.

The treatment of vulvovaginitis depends on the etiology (see Table 115-1). Treatment of nonspecific vaginitisfocuses on improving perineal hygiene.

Figure 14.10 Vulvar aphthosis in prepubertal girl.

The symptom of vaginal discharge in the prepubertal age group is almost always caused by inﬂammation and irritation. In prepubertal girls, the primary site typically is the vulva, with vaginitis following secondarily, whereas in adolescents and adults, vaginitis typically is the primary finding with vulvitis occurring secondarily. Sexual abuse should always be considered in prepubertal children with vaginal discharge or a foreign body (47). Although the routine use of cultures to detect sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in girls with a history of sexual abuse was questioned, vaginal culture for gonorrhea and chlamydia should be performed in girls who have symptoms that include vaginal discharge (48). In prepubertal girls, vulvovaginitis is usually caused by multiple organisms that are present in the perineal area, although a single organism such as Streptococcus, or even rarely Shigella, may be causative (49). When the cause is related to poor perineal hygiene, cultures often reveal a mixture of bacterial organisms. In this situation, the typical history is intermittent symptoms of irritation, itching, discharge, and odor over many months to years. Treatment should be initiated with a focus on hygiene and cleansing measures (40). A short-term (less than 4 weeks) course of treatment with topical estrogens and broad-spectrum antibiotics may be necessary. The problem is frequently recurrent. In girls who have a relatively acute onset of vaginal discharge and vulvovaginal symptoms, a single bacterial organism is more likely to be the cause of their symptoms.

Behcet’s Disease This systemic condition is characterized by genital and oral ulcerations with ocular inﬂammation and many other manifestations (244). The cause and the most effective therapy are not well established, although anti-inﬂammatory and immunosuppressive therapies may be effective (245).

Lichen Planus This condition causes oral and genital ulcerations. Typically, there is desquamative vaginitis with erosion of the vestibule. Treatment is based on the use of both topical and systemic steroids. Plasma cell mucositis appears as erosions in the vulvar area, particularly the vestibule. Biopsy is essential in establishing the diagnosis.

Vaginal discharge is one of the most common vaginal symptoms. Conditions ranging from vaginal candidiasis to chlamydia cervicitis to bacterial vaginosis to cervical carcinoma may cause vaginal discharge. Infectious vaginal conditions are addressed more completely in Chapter 18. Vaginal lesions may occasionally be palpable to a woman. More commonly, vaginal lesions are discovered on examination by a clinician. They may contribute to symptoms (such as bleeding or discharge) or they may be entirely asymptomatic. Vaginitis, cervicitis, and vaginal or cervical lesions (including malignancies) can be causes of vaginal discharge. Other noninfectious causes of discharge are as follows: 1.

Retained foreign body—tampon, pessary 2.

Ulcerations—tampon-induced, lichen planus, herpes simplex infection 3.

The patient was hypothyroid.

Hypothyroidism refers to the clinical and biochemical state in which the thyroid gland is underactive (hyperthyroidism refers to an overactive thyroid gland). Some patients have thyroid masses and no clinical or biochemical abnormalities—these patients are euthyroid.

The hormone thyroxine controls the basal metabolic rate; therefore, low levels of thyroxine affect the resting pulse rate and may produce other changes, including weight gain, and in some cases depression.

The patient was insistent upon surgery.

After discussion about the risks and complications, a subtotal thyroidectomy was performed. After the procedure the patient complained of tingling in her hands and feet and around her mouth, and carpopedal spasm. These symptoms are typical of tetany and are caused by low serum calcium levels.

The etiology of the low serum calcium level was trauma and bruising of the four parathyroid glands left in situ after the operation. Undoubtedly the trauma of removal of such a large thyroid gland produced a change within the parathyroid gland, which failed to function appropriately. The secretion of parathyroid hormone rapidly decreased over the next 24 hours, resulting in increased excitability of peripheral nerves, manifest by carpopedal spasm and orofacial tingling. Muscle spasms can also be elicited by tapping the facial nerve [VII] as it emerges from the parotid gland to produce twitching of the facial muscles (Chvostek’s sign).

The patient recovered from these symptoms due to a low calcium level over the next 24 hours.

At her return to the clinic the patient was placed on supplementary oral thyroxine, which is necessary after removal of the thyroid gland.

The patient also complained of a hoarse voice.

The etiology of her hoarse voice was damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

The recurrent laryngeal nerve lies close to the thyroid gland. It may be damaged in difficult surgical procedures, and this may produce unilateral spasm of the ipsilateral vocal cord to produce a hoarse voice.

Since the thyroidectomy and institution of thyroxine treatment, the patient has lost weight and has no further complaints.

The etiology is multifactorial: smoking, LPR, hypothyroidism, and vocal misuse.40 This pathol-ogy is more common in women (because they present early due to a deep vocal pitch change in their voice) and heavy smokers. The physical examination findings are typically bilateral. Sur-gery typically involves microlaryngoscopy with removal of the gelatinous debris in Reinke’s space with trimming of the excess mucosa. However, smoking cessation and surgery do not

In the clinic

In emergency situations, when the airway is blocked above the level of the vocal folds, the median cricothyroid ligament can be perforated and a small tube inserted through the incision to establish an airway. Except for small vessels and the occasional presence of a pyramidal lobe of the thyroid gland, normally there are few structures between the median cricothyroid ligament and the skin.

In the clinic

A tracheostomy is a surgical procedure in which a hole is made in the trachea and a tube is inserted to enable ventilation.

A tracheostomy is typically performed when there is obstruction to the larynx as a result of inhalation of a foreign body, severe edema secondary to anaphylactic reaction, or severe head and neck trauma.

The typical situation in which a tracheostomy is performed is in the calm atmosphere of an operating theater. A small transverse incision is placed in the lower third of the neck anteriorly. The strap muscles are deviated laterally and the trachea can be easily visualized. Occasionally it is necessary to divide the isthmus of the thyroid gland. An incision is made in the second and third tracheal rings and a small tracheostomy tube inserted.

After the tracheostomy has been in situ for the required length of time, it is simply removed. The hole through which it was inserted almost inevitably closes without any intervention.

Patients with long-term tracheostomies are unable to vocalize because no air is passing through the vocal cords.

In the clinic

Laryngoscopy is a medical procedure that is used to inspect the larynx. The functions of laryngoscopy include the evaluation of patients with difficulty swallowing, assessment of the vocal cords, and assessment of the larynx for tumors, masses, and weak voice.

Chronic bronchitis is diagnosed on clinical grounds: it is defined by the presence of a persistent productive cough for at least 3 consecutive months in at least 2 consecutive years. It is common among cigarette smokers and urban dwellers in smog-ridden cities; some studies indicate that 20% to 25% of men in the 40to 65-year-old age group have the disease. In early stages of the disease, the cough raises mucoid sputum, but airflow is not obstructed. Some patients with chronic bronchitis have evidence of hyperresponsive airways, with intermittent bronchospasm and wheezing (asthmatic bronchitis), while other bronchitic patients, especially heavy smokers, develop chronic outflow obstruction, usually with associated emphysema (COPD).

The distinctive feature of chronic bronchitis is hypersecretion of mucus, beginning in the large airways.

Bronchiolitis is a leading cause of hospitalization of infants. Bronchiolitis occurs almost exclusively during the first 2 years of life, with a peak age at 2 to 6 months. Many healthy children with bronchiolitis can be managed as outpatients; however, premature infants and children with chronic lung disease of prematurity, hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease, neuromuscular weakness, or immunodeficiency are at increased risk of severe, potentially fatal disease. Children acquire infection after exposure to infected family members, who typically have symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection, or from infected children in day care. In the United States, annual peaks are usually in the late winter months from December through March.

Bronchiolitis caused by RSV has an incubation period of 4 to6 days. Bronchiolitis classically presents as a progressive respiratory illness similar to the common cold in its early phasewith cough and rhinorrhea. It progresses over 3 to 7 days tonoisy, raspy breathing and audible wheezing. There is usually a low-grade fever accompanied by irritability, which mayreflect the increased work of breathing. In contrast to the classic progression of disease, young infants infected with RSV may not have a prodrome and may have apnea as the first signof infection.

Physical signs of bronchiolar obstruction include prolongation of the expiratory phase of breathing, nasal flaring, intercostal retractions, suprasternal retractions, and air trapping with hyperexpansion of the lungs. During the wheezing phase, percussion of the chest usually reveals only hyperresonance, but auscultation usually reveals diffuse wheezes and crackles throughout the breathing cycle. With more severe disease, grunting and cyanosis may be present.

Routine laboratory tests are not required to confirm the diagnosis. It is important to assess oxygenation in severe cases of bronchiolitis. Pulse oximetry is adequate for monitoring oxygen saturation. Frequent, regular assessments and cardiorespiratory monitoring of infants are necessary because respiratory failure may develop precipitously in very tired infants even though blood gas values taken before rapid decompensation are reassuring.

asthma and allergy. Exacerbating factors include viral infections, exposure to allergens and irritants (e.g., smoke, strong odors, fumes), exercise, emotions, and change in weather/humidity. Nighttime symptoms are common. Rhinosinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (especially aspirin) can aggravate asthma. Treatment of these conditions may lessen the frequency and severity of the asthma.

During acute episodes, tachypnea, tachycardia, cough, wheezing, and a prolonged expiratory phase may be present. Physical findings may be subtle. Classic wheezing may not be prominent if there is poor air movement from airway obstruction. As the attack progresses, cyanosis, diminished air movement, retractions, agitation, inability to speak, tripod sitting position, diaphoresis, and pulsus paradoxus (decrease in blood pressure of >15 mm Hg with inspiration) may be observed. Physical examination may show evidence of other atopic diseases such as eczema or allergic rhinitis.

Objective measurements of pulmonary function (spirometry) help establish the diagnosis and direct the treatment of asthma. Spirometry is used to monitor response to treatment, assess degree of reversibility with therapeutic intervention, and measure the severity of an asthma exacerbation. Children older than 5 years of age can perform spirometry maneuvers. Variability in predicted peak flow reference values make spirometry preferred to peak flow measures in the diagnosis of asthma. For younger children who cannot perform spirometry maneuvers or peak flow, a therapeutic trial of controller medications helps in the diagnosis of asthma.

LABORATORY STUDIES Blood The smear shows large erythrocytes and a paucity of platelets and granulocytes. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is commonly increased. Reticulocytes are absent or few, and lymphocyte numbers may be normal or reduced. The presence of immature myeloid forms suggests leukemia or MDS; nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) suggest marrow fibrosis or tumor invasion; abnormal platelets suggest either peripheral destruction or MDS.

Bone Marrow The bone marrow is usually readily aspirated but dilute on smear, and the fatty biopsy specimen may be grossly pale on withdrawal; a “dry tap” instead suggests fibrosis or myelophthisis. In severe aplasia, the smear of the aspirated specimen shows only red cells, residual lymphocytes, and stromal cells; the biopsy (which should be >1 cm in length) is superior for determination of cellularity and shows mainly fat under the microscope, with hematopoietic cells occupying <25% of the marrow space; in the most serious cases, the biopsy is virtually all fat. The correlation between marrow cellularity and disease severity is imperfect, in part because marrow cellularity declines physiologically with aging. Additionally, some patients with moderate disease by blood counts will have empty iliac crest biopsies, whereas “hot spots” of hematopoiesis may be seen in severe cases. If an iliac crest specimen is inadequate, cells may also be obtained by aspiration from the sternum. Residual hematopoietic cells should have normal morphology, except for mildly megaloblastic erythropoiesis; megakaryocytes are invariably greatly reduced and usually absent. Granulomas may indicate an infectious etiology of the marrow failure.

The WBC count is usually elevated, but the cells are dysfunctional, and patients may be neutropenic with a history of frequent infection. If the WBC is very high (> 100,000), there is a risk of leukostasis (blasts occluding the microcirculation, leading to pulmonary edema, CNS symptoms, ischemic injury, and DIC).

The type of acute leukemia is further classified according to the FAB system (ALL: L1–L3; AML: M0–M7) and karyotype analysis. Prognosis varies with leukemic cytogenetics.

T AB LE 2.7 -6. Myeloblasts vs. Lymphoblasts

Size Larger (2–4 times RBC) Smaller (1.5–3.0 times RBC) Amount of cytoplasm More Less Nucleoli Conspicuous Inconspicuous Granules Common, f ne Uncommon, coarse Auer rods Present in 50% of cases Absent Myeloperoxidase

ALL and AML are treated primarily with chemotherapeutic agents, although transfusions, antibiotics, and colony-stimulating factors are also used. Patients with unfavorable genetics or those who do not achieve remission may be candidates for bone marrow transplantation.

Prior to therapy, patients should be well hydrated, and if their WBC counts are high, they may be started on allopurinol to prevent hyperuricemia and renal insufficiency resulting from blast lysis (tumor lysis syndrome).

Leukostasis syndrome may be treated with hydroxyurea +/– leukapheresis to rapidly ↓ WBC count.

Indicators of a poor prognosis are as follows:

ALL: Age < 1 year or > 10 years; an ↑ in WBC count to > 50,000; the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome t(9,22) (associated with B-cell cancer); CNS involvement at diagnosis; and L3 morphology (associated with Burkitt’s lymphoma).

document (2) 

Accelerated: A transition toward blast crisis, with an ↑ in peripheral and bone marrow blood counts. Should be suspected when the differential shows an abrupt ↑ in basophils and thrombocytopenia < 100,000.

Blast: Resembles acute leukemia; survival is 3–6 months.

■Diagnosed by the clinical picture, including labs; cytogenetic analysis usually reveals the Philadelphia chromosome.

TAB LE 2.7 -7. Clinical Staging of CLL (Rai Staging)

CBwC shows a very high WBC—often > 100,000 at diagnosis, and sometimes reaching > 500,000. Differential shows granulocytes in all stages of maturation. Rarely, the WBC count will be so elevated as to cause a hyperviscosity syndrome.

Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase is low; LDH, uric acid, and B12 levels are elevated.

Varies with disease phase and is undergoing rapid change, particularly since the introduction of targeted therapies:

Chronic: Imatinib. Younger patients can be treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation if a suitable matched sibling donor is available.

Blast: Therapy as for acute leukemia or dasatinib plus hematopoietic stem cell transplant or clinical trial.

A malignant disorder of well-differentiated B lymphocytes with an unclear cause. HCL is a rare disease that accounts for 2% of adult leukemia cases and most commonly affects older males.

Typically presents with pancytopenia, bone marrow infiltration, and splenomegaly.

Patients complain of weakness, fatigue, petechiae and bruising, infection (especially with atypical mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium avium– intracellulare), abdominal pain, early satiety, and weight loss. Symptoms are similar to those of CLL except that patients rarely have lymphadenopathy.

Diagnosed by the history, physical exam, and labs; confirmed through the identification of hairy cells in the blood, marrow, or spleen.

document (3) 

AML: Age > 60 years, CD34+ or MDR1+ phenotype, elevated LDH, mutations in chromosomes 5 or 7, t(6,9), trisomy 8 or a more complex karyotype, FLT3 gene mutation, and FAB M7 (acute megakaryocytic variant).

AML type (FAB) M3—acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)—has a good prognosis because it is responsive to all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) therapy. The mutation that causes this form of AML contains the retinoic acid receptor. ATRA is less toxic than conventional chemotherapy.

A malignant, clonal proliferation of functionally incompetent lymphocytes that accumulate in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. The most common type of leukemia. A rare form of T-cell CLL exists, but almost all cases involve well-differentiated B lymphocytes. The etiology is unknown, although there is some genetic contribution, as first-degree relatives of patients with CLL are three times more likely than others to develop a lymphoid malignancy. Primarily affects older adults (median age 65); the male-to-female ratio is 2:1.

Often asymptomatic, but many patients present with fatigue, malaise, and infection. Common physical findings are lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly.

Diagnosed by the clinical picture; may be confirmed by f ow cytometry demonstrating the presence of CD5—normally found only on T cells—on leukemic cells with the characteristic B-cell antigens CD20 and CD21.

CBC shows lymphocytosis (lymphocyte count > 5000) with an abundance of small, normal-appearing lymphocytes and ruptured smudge cells on peripheral smear. Granulocytopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia are common owing to marrow infiltration with leukemic cells. Abnormal function by the leukemic cells leads to hypogammaglobulinemia.

Bone marrow biopsy is rarely required for diagnosis or staging but may provide prognostic information and may help assess response to therapy.

2023-11-29 14:12:40,665 query: A 57-year-old man presents to the emergency department with confusion. His symptoms started a few days ago and have been gradually worsening. Initially, the patient had a fever and a cough which has progressed to abdominal pain, diarrhea, and confusion. His temperature is 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure is 127/68 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. Physical exam is notable for localized crackles and decreased breath sounds in the left lower lung field. The patient is confused and is answering questions inappropriately.

A 32-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with weakness and hypokalemia. The patient had been very healthy until 2 months previously when he developed intermittent leg weakness. His review of systems was otherwise negative. He denied drug or laxative abuse and was on no medications. Past medical history was unremarkable, with no history of neuromuscular disease. Family history was notable for a sister with thyroid disease. Physical examination was notable only for reduced deep tendon reflexes.

Sodium 139 143 meq/L Potassium 2.0 3.8 meq/L Chloride 105 107 meq/L Bicarbonate 26 29 meq/L BUN 11 16 mg/dL Creatinine 0.6 1.0 mg/dL Calcium 8.8 8.8 mg/dL Phosphate 1.2 mg/dL Albumin 3.8 meq/L TSH 0.08 μIU/L (normal 0.2–5.39) Free T4 41 pmol/L (normal 10–27)

This patient developed hypokalemia due to a redistribution of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular compartments; this pathophysiology was readily apparent following calculation of the TTKG. The TTKG is calculated as (P × U )/(P ×

U ). The expected values for the TTKG are <3 in the presence of hypokalemia and >7–8 in the presence of hyperkalemia (see also Case 2 and Case 8). Alternatively, a urinary K+-to-creatinine ratio of >13 mmol/g creatinine (>1.5 mmol/mmol creatinine) is compatible with excessive renal K+ excretion. In this case, the calculated TTKG was 2.5, consistent with appropriate renal conservation of K+ and a nonrenal cause for hypokalemia. In the absence of significant gastrointestinal loss of K+, the patient was diagnosed with a “redistributive” subtype of hypokalemia.

The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly.

The plasma Na+ concentration on admission was 113 meq/L, with a creatinine of 2.35 (Table 64e-1). At hospital hour 7, the plasma Na+ concentration was 120 meq/L, potassium 5.4 meq/L, chloride 90 64e-5 meq/L, bicarbonate 22 meq/L, BUN 32 mg/dL, creatinine 2.02 mg/dL, glucose 89 mg/dL, total protein 5.0, and albumin 1.9. The hematocrit was 33.9, white count 7.6, and platelets 405. A morning cortisol was 19.5, with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 1.7. The patient was treated with 1 μg of intravenous DDAVP, along with 75 mL/h of intravenous half-normal saline. After the plasma Na+ concentration dropped to 116 meq/L, intravenous fluid was switched to normal saline at the same infusion rate. The subsequent results are shown in Table 64e-1.

This patient presented with hypovolemic hyponatremia and a “prerenal” reduction in GFR, with an increase in serum creatinine. She had experienced diarrhea for some time and manifested an orthostatic tachycardia after a liter of normal saline. As expected for hypovolemic hyponatremia, the urine Na+ concentration was <20 meq/L in the absence of congestive heart failure or other causes of hypervolemic hyponatremia, and she responded to saline hydration with an increase in plasma Na+ concentration and a decrease in creatinine.

Hemodialysis is the most effective and reliable method to reduce plasma K+ concentration; peritoneal dialysis is considerably less effective. Patients with acute kidney injury require temporary, urgent venous access for hemodialysis, with the attendant risks; in contrast, patients with ESRD or advanced chronic kidney disease may have a preexisting venous access. The amount of K+ removed during hemodialysis depends on the relative distribution of K+ between ICF and ECF (potentially affected by prior therapy for hyperkalemia), the type and surface area of the dialyzer used, dialysate and blood flow rates, dialysate flow rate, dialysis duration, and the plasma-to-dialysate K+ gradient.

Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalances and Acid-Base Disturbances: Case Examples David B. Mount, Thomas D. DuBose, Jr. CASE 1 64e

A 23-year-old woman was admitted with a 3-day history of fever, cough productive of blood-tinged sputum, confusion, and orthostasis. Past medical history included type 1 diabetes mellitus. A physical examination in the emergency department indicated postural hypo-tension, tachycardia, and Kussmaul respiration. The breath was noted to smell of “acetone.” Examination of the thorax suggested consolidation in the right lower lobe.

Sodium 130 meq/L Potassium 5.0 meq/L Chloride 96 meq/L CO2 14 meq/L Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 20 mg/dL Creatinine 1.3 mg/dL Glucose 450 mg/dL

Pneumonic infiltrate, right lower lobe

The diagnosis of the acid-base disorder should proceed in a stepwise fashion: 1.

The normal anion gap (AG) is 8–10 meq/L, but in this case, the AG is elevated (20 meq/L). Therefore, the change in AG (ΔAG) = ~10 meq/L.

Occurs when the iris dilates and pushes against the lens of the eye, disrupting ﬂow of aqueous humor into the anterior chamber. Pressure in the posterior chamber then pushes the peripheral iris forward and blocks the angle.

Risk factors include family history, older age, Asian ethnicity, hyperopia, prolonged pupillary dilation (prolonged time in a dark area, stress, medications), anterior uveitis, and lens dislocation.

Hx/PE: Classically presents with extreme eye pain, blurred vision, headache, nausea, and vomiting. A hard, red eye is seen (from acute closure of a narrow anterior chamber angle); the pupil is dilated and nonreactive to light. IOP is ↑. If it resolves spontaneously prior to presentation (e.g., with pupillary constriction in sunlight), ophthalmologic examination may reveal narrow angles in one or both eyes.

Dx: Diagnosis is based on clinical history and examination. Those that resolve may mimic a migraine headache with blurred vision; the distinction is that the headaches and blurred vision are more likely to be triggered by darkness (due to pupillary dilation) rather than by bright lights (migraine).

An urgent surgical procedure was performed.

Burr holes were placed around the region of the hematoma and it was evacuated. The small branch of the middle meningeal artery was ligated and the patient spent a few days in the intensive care unit. Fortunately the patient made an uneventful recovery.

A 35-year-old man was involved in a fight and sustained a punch to the right orbit. He came to the emergency department with double vision.

The double vision was only in one plane.

Examination of the orbits revealed that when the patient was asked to look upward the right eye was unable to move superiorly when adducted. There was some limitation in general eye movement. Assessment of the lateral rectus muscle (abducent nerve [VI]), superior oblique muscle (trochlear nerve [IV]), and the rest of the eye muscles (oculomotor nerve [III]) was otherwise unremarkable.

The patient underwent a CT scan.

A CT scan of the facial bones demonstrated a fracture through the floor of the orbit (Fig. 8.293).

A careful review of this CT scan demonstrated that the inferior oblique muscle had been pulled inferiorly with the fragment of bone in the fracture. This produced a tethering effect, so when the patient was asked to gaze in the upward direction, the left eye was able to do so but the right eye was unable to because of the tethered inferior oblique muscle.

The patient underwent surgical exploration to elevate the small bony fragment and return the inferior oblique to its appropriate position. On follow-up the patient had no complications.

A 25-year-old man complained of significant swelling in front of his right ear before and around mealtimes. This swelling was associated with considerable pain, which was provoked by the ingestion of lemon sweets. On examination he had tenderness around the right parotid region and a hard nodule was demonstrated in the buccal mucosa adjacent to the right upper molar teeth.

A diagnosis of parotid duct calculus was made.

CN II (Optic) Check visual acuity (with eyeglasses or contact lens correction) using a Snellen chart or similar tool. Test the visual fields by confrontation, i.e., by comparing the patient’s visual fields to your own. As a screening test, it is usually sufficient to examine the visual fields of both eyes simultaneously; individual eye fields should be tested if there is any reason to suspect a problem of vision by the history or other elements of the examination, or if the screening test reveals an abnormality. Face the patient at a distance of approximately 0.6–1.0 m

approximately 0.6–1.0 m (2–3 ft) and place your hands at the periphery of your visual fields in the plane that is equidistant between you and the patient. Instruct the patient to look directly at the center of your face and to indicate when and where he or she sees one of your fingers moving. Beginning with the two inferior quadrants and then the two superior quadrants, move your index finger of the right hand, left hand, or both hands simultaneously and observe whether the patient detects the movements. A single small-amplitude movement of the finger is sufficient

the finger is sufficient for a normal response. Focal perimetry and tangent screen examinations should be used to map out visual field defects fully or to search for subtle abnormalities. Optic fundi should be examined with an ophthalmoscope, and the color, size, and degree of swelling or elevation of the optic disc noted, as well as the color and texture of the retina. The retinal vessels should be checked for size, regularity, arteriovenous nicking at crossing points, hemorrhage, exudates, etc.

Two-dimensional echocardiography is useful for measuring RV thickness and chamber dimensions. Location of the RV behind the sternum and its crescent shape challenge assessment of RV function by echocardiography, especially when parenchymal lung disease is present. Calculated measures of RV function (e.g., tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion [TAPSE] or the Tei Index) supplement more subjective assessments of RV function. The interventricular septum may move paradoxically during systole in the presence of pulmonary hypertension. As noted, Doppler echocardiography can be used to assess pulmonary artery pressures. MRI is also useful for assessing RV structure and function, particularly in patients who are difficult to image with 2-D echocardiography because of severe lung disease. Right-heart catheterization is useful for confirming the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension and for excluding elevated left-heart pressures (measured as the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) as a cause for right HF. BNP and N-terminal BNP levels are elevated in patients with cor pulmonale secondary to RV myocardial stretch and may be dramatically elevated in acute pulmonary embolism.

History and Physical Examination The chest discomfort, often severe enough to be described as frank pain, is typically located in the sub-sternal region or sometimes in the epigastrium, and radiates to the left arm, left shoulder, and/or neck. Anginal “equivalents” such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension.

Electrocardiogram ST-segment depression occurs in 20 to 25% of patients; it may be transient in patients without biomarker evidence of myocardial necrosis, but may be persistent for several days in NSTEMI. T-wave changes are common but are less specific signs of ischemia, unless they are new and deep T-wave inversions (≥0.3 mV).

Signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary depending on the infecting organism and the patient’s immune status. In typical pneumonias, the usual presentation is a patient with high fever, rigors, productive cough, chills, and pleuritic chest pain. Chest radiography often will show infiltrates (11). The following agents, listed in decreasing order, cause two-thirds of all bacterial pneumonias: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus inﬂuenza, Klebsiella pneumoniae, gram-negative organisms, and anaerobic bacteria. Atypical pneumonias are more insidious in onset than typical pneumonias. Patients have moderate fever without the characteristic rigors and chills. Additional symptoms include a nonproductive cough, headache, myalgias, and mild leukocytosis. Chest radiography reveals bronchopneumonia with a diffuse interstitial pattern; characteristically, the patient does not appear to be as ill as the x-ray suggests. Common causes of atypical pneumonia include viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia pneumoniae (also called the TWAR agent), and other rare agents.

A strong index of suspicion is required for diagnosis, especially in elderly and immunocompromised individuals, who have altered response mechanisms. This is true with “typical agents.” Subtle clues in the elderly include changes in mentation, confusion, and exacerbation of other illnesses. The febrile response may be entirely absent, and the results of the physical examination are not predictive of pneumonia. In high-risk groups, an increased respiratory rate of greater than 25 breaths per minute remains the most reliable sign of infection. Mortality in these high-risk groups of patients is strongly correlated with the ability of the host to mount normal defenses to the symptoms of fever, chills, and tachycardia.

All women suspected of having pneumonia should undergo chest radiography to establish the diagnosis and to detect alternate diagnoses such as congestive heart failure and tumors.

Examination of the chest includes inspection of the chest wall to identify asymmetry resulting from absence of the pectoralis muscle and inspection of the breast tissue to determine gestational age and detect a breast abscess. Boys and girls may have breast engorgement and produce milk; milk expression should not be attempted. Supernumerary nipples may be bilateral and may be associated with renal anomalies.

Examination of the lungs includes observations of the rate, depth, and nature of intercostal or sternal retractions. Breath sounds should be equal on both sides of the chest, and rales should not be heard after the first 1 to 2 hours of life. Diminished or absent breath sounds on one side suggest pneumothorax, collapsed lung, pleural effusion, or diaphragmatic hernia. Shift of the cardiac impulse away from a tension pneumothorax and diaphragmatic hernia and toward the collapsed lung is a helpful physical finding for differentiating these disorders. Subcutaneous emphysema of the neck or chest also suggests a pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum, whereas bowel sounds auscultated in the chest in the presence of a scaphoid abdomen suggest a diaphragmatic hernia.

The position of the heart in infants is more midline than in older children. The first heart sound is normal, whereas the second heart sound may not be split in the first day of life. Decreased splitting of the second heart sound is noted in PPHN, transposition of the great vessels, and pulmonary atresia. Heart murmurs in newborns are common in the delivery room and during the first day of life. Most of these murmurs are transient and are due to closure of the ductus arteriosus, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, or a small ventral septal defect. Pulses should be palpated in the upper and lower extremities (over the brachial and femoral arteries). Blood pressure in the upper and lower extremities should be measured in all patients with a murmur or heart failure. An upperto-lower extremity gradient of more than 10 to 20 mm Hg suggests coarctation of the aorta.

Patients with Aspergillus infection often present with pleuritic chest pain and fever, which are sometimes accompanied by cough. Hemoptysis may be an ominous sign. Chest x-rays may reveal new focal infiltrates or nodules. Chest CT may reveal a characteristic halo consisting of a mass-like infiltrate surrounded by an area of low attenuation. The presence of a “crescent sign” on chest x-ray or chest CT, in which the mass progresses to central cavitation, is characteristic of invasive Aspergillus infection but may develop as the lesions are resolving.

In addition to causing pulmonary disease, Aspergillus may invade through the nose or palate, with deep sinus penetration. The appearance of a discolored area in the nasal passages or on the hard palate should prompt a search for invasive Aspergillus. This situation is likely to require surgical debridement. Catheter infections with Aspergillus usually require both removal of the catheter and antifungal therapy.

Disease severity increases with age. St. Louis encephalitis virus infections that result in aseptic meningitis or mild encephalitis are concentrated among children and young adults, while severe and fatal cases primarily affect the elderly. Infection rates are similar in all age groups; thus the greater susceptibility of older persons to disease is a biologic consequence of aging. St. Louis encephalitis has an abrupt onset after an incubation period of 4–21 days, sometimes following a prodrome, and begins with fever, lethargy, confusion, and headache.

Examination of the chest includes inspection of the chest wall to identify asymmetry resulting from absence of the pectoralis muscle and inspection of the breast tissue to determine gestational age and detect a breast abscess. Boys and girls may have breast engorgement and produce milk; milk expression should not be attempted. Supernumerary nipples may be bilateral and may be associated with renal anomalies.

Examination of the lungs includes observations of the rate, depth, and nature of intercostal or sternal retractions. Breath sounds should be equal on both sides of the chest, and rales should not be heard after the first 1 to 2 hours of life. Diminished or absent breath sounds on one side suggest pneumothorax, collapsed lung, pleural effusion, or diaphragmatic hernia. Shift of the cardiac impulse away from a tension pneumothorax and diaphragmatic hernia and toward the collapsed lung is a helpful physical finding for differentiating these disorders. Subcutaneous emphysema of the neck or chest also suggests a pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum, whereas bowel sounds auscultated in the chest in the presence of a scaphoid abdomen suggest a diaphragmatic hernia.

The position of the heart in infants is more midline than in older children. The first heart sound is normal, whereas the second heart sound may not be split in the first day of life. Decreased splitting of the second heart sound is noted in PPHN, transposition of the great vessels, and pulmonary atresia. Heart murmurs in newborns are common in the delivery room and during the first day of life. Most of these murmurs are transient and are due to closure of the ductus arteriosus, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, or a small ventral septal defect. Pulses should be palpated in the upper and lower extremities (over the brachial and femoral arteries). Blood pressure in the upper and lower extremities should be measured in all patients with a murmur or heart failure. An upperto-lower extremity gradient of more than 10 to 20 mm Hg suggests coarctation of the aorta.

At each return visit, the well-being of mother and fetus are assessed (see Table 9-1). Fetal heart rate, growth, and activity and amnionic fluid volume are evaluated. Maternal blood pressure and weight and their extent of change are examined. Symptoms such as headache, altered vision, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, bleeding, vaginal luid leakage, and dysuria are sought. Mter 20 weeks' gestation, uterine examination measures size from the symphysis to the fundus. In late pregnancy, vaginal examination often provides valuable information that includes conirmation of the presenting part and its station, clinical estimation of pelvic capacity and configuration, amnionic luid volume adequacy, and cervical consistency, efacement, and dilatation (Chap. 22, p. 435).

Between 20 and 34 weeks' gestation, the height of the uterine fundus measured in centimeters correlates closely with gestational age in weeks Gimenez, 1983). his measurement is used to monitor fetal growth and amnionic fluid volume. It is measured along the abdominal wall from the top of the symphysis pubis to the top of the fundus. Importantly, the bladder must be emptied before fundal measurement (Worthen, 1980). Obesity or the presence of uterine masses such as leiomyomas may also limit fundal height accuracy. Moreover, using fundal height alone, fetal-growth restriction may be undiagnosed in up to a third of cases (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2015b; Haragan, 2015).

Instruments incorporating Doppler ultrasound are often used to easily detect fetal heart action, and in the absence of maternal obesity, heart sounds are almost always detectable by 10 weeks with such instruments (Chap. 10, p. 213). he fetal heart rate ranges from 11e0 to 160 beats per minute and is typically heard as a double sound. Using a standard nonampliied stethoscope, the fetal heart is audible by 20 weeks in 80 percent of women, and by 22 weeks, heart sounds are expected to be heard in all (Herbert, 1987). Because the fetus moves freely in amni onic fluid, the site on the maternal abdomen where fetal heart sounds can be heard best will vary.

If the heart rate remains � 100 bpm after 5 to 10 positive pressure breaths, the attempted ventilation is inadequate and corrective steps must be taken. These can be remembered by the pneumonic MR. SOPA (Table 32-1). The two most common problems are mask leak due to an inefective seal and malposition of the airway (Schmolzer, 2011). If corrective steps do not improve the heart rate, either intubation with an endotracheal tube or placement of a laryngeal mask airway is required.

If mask ventilation is inefective or prolonged, an alternative airway is placed. For tracheal intubation, a laryngoscope with a straight blade-size 0 for a preterm newborn and size 1 for a term neonate-is used. Gentle cricoid pressure may be useful. An increasing heart rate and ETC02 detection after several breaths are the primary methods of conirming intubation of the trachea and not the esophagus. One can also look for symmetrical chest wall motion; auscultate for equal breath sounds, especially in the axillae; and auscultate for the absence of breath sounds or gurgling over the stomach.

The Newborn 609

Once in place, the tube is used for tracheal suctioning only for a suspected obstructed airway. Otherwise, an appropriate positive-pressure device is attached to the endotracheal tube. Air pufs are delivered at a rate of 40 to 60 per minute with a force adequate to stabilize the heart rate. In term infants, opening pressures of 30 to 40 cm H20 typically will expand the alveoli without causing barotrauma. Once the lung is inflated, less pressure is typically needed (20 to 25 cm

H20). For preterm infants, pressures of 20 to 25 cm

Chronic cough is defined as a daily cough lasting longer than 3 weeks. Common causes of chronic cough are asthma, postnasal drip (allergic rhinitis, sinusitis), and postinfectious tussive syndromes. It can also be caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease, swallowing dysfunction (infants), anatomic abnormalities (tracheoesophageal fistula, tracheomalacia), and chronic infection. Persistent cough may also be caused by exposure to irritants (tobacco and wood stove smoke) or foreign body aspiration, or it may be psychogenic in origin.

During the first several years of life, children experience frequent viral respiratory infections, especially if they have multiple older siblings or attend day care or preschool. Cough that resolves promptly and is clearly associated with a viral infection does not require further diagnostic workup. However, cough persisting longer than 3 weeks warrants further evaluation.

Chest radiographs are useful in assessing respiratory disease in children. In addition to determining lung abnormalities, they provide information about the bony thorax (rib or vertebral abnormalities), the heart (cardiomegaly, pericardial effusion), and the great vessels (right aortic arch/vascular rings, rib notching). Chest radiographs should be obtained in both the posteroanterior (PA) and lateral projections and, if possible, following a full inspiration. Estimation of lung hyperinflation based on a single PA view is unreliable; flattened diaphragms and an increased AP diameter on lateral projection is a better indicator of hyperinflation. Crowding of the blood vessels with poor inspiration can be misinterpreted as increased markings or infiltrates. External skin folds, rotation, and motion may produce distorted or unclear images. Expiratory views and fluoroscopy may detect partial bronchial obstruction due to an aspirated foreign body that results in regional hyperinflation, because the affected lung or lobe does not deflate on exhalation. Fluoroscopy can also be used to evaluate diaphragm movement.

Laboratory Features The serum aminotransferases aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (previously designated SGOT and SGPT) increase to a variable degree during the prodromal phase of acute viral hepatitis and precede the rise in bilirubin level (Figs. 360-2 and 360-4). The level of these enzymes, however, does not correlate well with the degree of liver cell damage. Peak levels vary from 400–4000 IU or more; these levels are usually reached at the time the patient is clinically icteric and diminish progressively during the recovery phase of acute hepatitis. The diagnosis of anicteric hepatitis is based on clinical features and on aminotransferase elevations.

Jaundice is usually visible in the sclera or skin when the serum bilirubin value is >43 μmol/L (2.5 mg/dL). When jaundice appears, the serum bilirubin typically rises to levels ranging from 85–340 μmol/L (5–20 mg/dL). The serum bilirubin may continue to rise despite falling serum aminotransferase levels. In most instances, the total bilirubin is equally divided between the conjugated and unconjugated fractions. Bilirubin levels >340 μmol/L (20 mg/dL) extending and persisting late into the course of viral hepatitis are more likely to be associated with severe disease. In certain patients with underlying hemolytic anemia, however, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and sickle cell anemia, a high serum bilirubin level is common, resulting from superimposed hemolysis. In such patients, bilirubin levels >513 μmol/L (30 mg/dL) have been observed and are not necessarily associated with a poor prognosis.

Of pregnancy signs, changes in the lower reproductive tract, uterus, and breasts develop early. These are described in detail in Chapter 4 (p. 49).

Detection of hCG in maternal blood and urine is the basis for endocrine assays of pregnancy. Syncytiotrophoblast produces hCG in amounts that increase exponentially during the irst trimester following implantation. A main function of hCG is to prevent involution of the corpus luteum, which is the principal site of progesterone formation during the irst 6 weeks of pregnancy.

With a sensitive test, the hormone can be detected in maternal serum or urine by 8 to 9 days after ovulation. he doubling time of serum hCG concentration is 1.4 to 2.0 days. As shown in Figure 9-2, serum levels range widely and increase from the day of implantation. They reach peak levels at 60 to 70 days. Thereafter, the concentration declines slowly until a plateau is reached at approximately 16 weeks' gestation.

Measurement of hCG his hormone is a glycoprotein with high carbohydrate content. he general structure of hCG is a heterodimer composed of two dissimilar subunits, designated a and �, which are non covalently linked. The a-subunit is identical to those of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but the �-subunit is structurally distinct among these. hus, antibodies were developed with high speciicity for the hCG �-subunit.

FIGURE 9-2 Mean concentration (95% CI) of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in serum of This speciicity allows its detecwomen throughout normal pregnancy. tion, and numerous commercial immunoassays are available for measuring serum and urine hCG levels. Although each immunoassay detects a slightly diferent mixture of hCG variants, its free subunits, or its metabolites, all are appropriate for pregnancy testing (Braunstein, 2014).

Depending on the assay used, the sensitivity for the laboratory detection limit of hCG in serum is 1.0 mIU/mL or even lower (Wilcox, 2001).

The degree of clotting dysfunction also varies and can be serious and life threatening, especially if operative delivery is undertaken. Coagulopathy is caused by diminished hepatic procoagulant synthesis, although some evidence supports increased consumption from disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. As shown in Table 55-2, hypoibrinogenemia sometimes is profound. Of 51 women with fatty liver cared for at Parkland Hospital, almost a third had a plasma fibrinogen level nadir to < 100 mg/dL (Nelson, 2014). Modest level elevations of serum D-dimers or fibrin-split products indicate an element of consumptive coagulopathy. Although usually modest, occasionally thrombocytopenia is marked (see Table 55-2).

A 32-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with weakness and hypokalemia. The patient had been very healthy until 2 months previously when he developed intermittent leg weakness. His review of systems was otherwise negative. He denied drug or laxative abuse and was on no medications. Past medical history was unremarkable, with no history of neuromuscular disease. Family history was notable for a sister with thyroid disease. Physical examination was notable only for reduced deep tendon reflexes.

This patient developed hypokalemia due to a redistribution of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular compartments; this pathophysiology was readily apparent following calculation of the TTKG. The TTKG is calculated as (P × U )/(P ×

U ). The expected values for the TTKG are <3 in the presence of hypokalemia and >7–8 in the presence of hyperkalemia (see also Case 2 and Case 8). Alternatively, a urinary K+-to-creatinine ratio of >13 mmol/g creatinine (>1.5 mmol/mmol creatinine) is compatible with excessive renal K+ excretion. In this case, the calculated TTKG was 2.5, consistent with appropriate renal conservation of K+ and a nonrenal cause for hypokalemia. In the absence of significant gastrointestinal loss of K+, the patient was diagnosed with a “redistributive” subtype of hypokalemia.

A 65-year-old man has a history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease with baseline creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL. Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2–3+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?

Abnormalities in fluid volume and electrolyte composition are common and important clinical disorders. Drugs that block specific transport functions of the renal tubules are valuable clinical tools in the treatment of these disorders. Although various agents that increase urine volume (diuretics) have been described since antiquity, it was not until 1937 that carbonic anhydrase inhibitors were first described and not until 1957 that a much more useful and powerful diuretic agent (chlorothiazide) became available.

A 65-year-old man is referred to you from his primary care physician (PCP) for evaluation and management of pos-sible osteoporosis. He saw his PCP for evaluation of low back pain. X-rays of the spine showed some degenerative changes in the lumbar spine plus several wedge deformities in the thoracic spine. The patient is a long-time smoker (up to two packs per day) and has two to four glasses of wine with dinner, more on the weekends. He has chronic bronchitis, presumably from smoking, and has been treated on numerous occasions with oral prednisone for exacerba-tions of bronchitis. He is currently on 10 mg/d prednisone. Examination shows kyphosis of the thoracic spine, with some tenderness to fist percussion over the thoracic spine. The dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measure-ment of the lumbar spine is “within the normal limits,” but the radiologist noted that the reading may be misleading because of degenerative changes. The hip measurement shows a T score (number of standard deviations by which the patient’s measured bone density differs from that of a normal young adult) in the femoral neck of –2.2. What further workup should be considered, and what therapy should be initiated?

A 52-year-old woman visited her family physician with complaints of increasing lethargy and vomiting. The physician examined her and noted that compared to previous visits she had lost significant weight. She was also jaundiced, and on examination of the abdomen a well-defined 10-cm rounded mass was palpable below the liver edge in the right upper quadrant (Fig. 4.185).

The clinical diagnosis was carcinoma of the head of the pancreas.

It is difficult to appreciate how such a precise diagnosis can be made clinically when only three clinical signs have been described.

The patient’s obstruction was in the distal bile duct.

When a patient has jaundice, the causes are excessive breakdown of red blood cells (prehepatic), hepatic failure (hepatic jaundice), and posthepatic causes, which include obstruction along the length of the biliary tree.

The patient had a mass in her right upper quadrant that was palpable below the liver; this was the gallbladder.

In healthy individuals, the gallbladder is not palpable. An expanded gallbladder indicates obstruction either within the cystic duct or below the level of the cystic duct insertion (i.e., the bile duct).

The patient’s vomiting was related to the position of the tumor.

It is not uncommon for vomiting and weight loss (cachexia) to occur in patients with a malignant disease. The head of the pancreas lies within the curve of the duodenum, primarily adjacent to the descending part of the duodenum. Any tumor mass in the region of the head of the pancreas is likely to expand and may encase and invade the duodenum. Unfortunately, in this patient’s case, this happened, producing almost complete obstruction. Further discussion with the patient revealed that she was vomiting relatively undigested food soon after each meal.

A CT scan demonstrated further complications.

Substernal chest pain 2° to myocardial ischemia (O2 supply and demand mismatch). Prinzmetal’s (variant) angina mimics angina pectoris but is caused by vasospasm of coronary vessels. It classically affects young women at rest in the early morning and is associated with ST-segment elevation in the absence of cardiac enzyme elevation.

The classic triad consists of substernal chest pain or pressure (often described as a heaviness or pressure without pain), usually precipitated by stress or exertion and relieved by rest or nitrates.

Pain can radiate to the left arm, jaw, and neck and may be associated with shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, diaphoresis, or lightheadedness.

Examination of patients experiencing stable angina is generally unremarkable. Look for carotid and peripheral bruits suggesting atherosclerosis and hypertension.

Rule out pulmonary, GI, or other cardiac causes of chest pain.

Angina may be diagnosed from the history alone, but significant ST-segment changes on exercise stress test with ECG monitoring is diagnostic of CAD.

Women and diabetics classically experience “silent” ischemic events and present “atypically”; for this reason, it is necessary to maintain a high index of suspicion in this patient population.

Treat acute symptoms with ASA, O2 and/or IV nitroglycerin, and IV morphine, and consider IV β-blockers. The efficacy of nondihydropyridine CCBs (diltiazem, verapamil) and ACEIs has also been validated.

Patients with a suspected MI must be admitted and monitored until acute MI is ruled out by serial cardiac enzymes.

Treat chronic symptoms with nitrates, ASA, and β-blockers; CCBs are second-line agents for symptomatic control only.

Initiate risk factor reduction (e.g., smoking, cholesterol, hypertension). Hormone replacement therapy is not protective in postmenopausal women.

Women, diabetics, the elderly, and post–heart transplant patients may have atypical, clinically silent MIs.

Heart Rate Variation with Deep Breathing This tests the parasympathetic component of cardiovascular reflexes via the vagus nerve. Results are influenced by multiple factors including the subject’s position (recumbent, sitting, or standing), rate and depth of respiration (6 breaths per minute and a forced vital capacity [FVC] >1.5 L are optimal), age, medications, weight, and degree of hypocapnia. Interpretation of results requires comparison of test data with results from age-matched controls collected under identical test conditions. For example, the lower limit of normal heart rate variation with deep breathing in persons <20 years is >15–20 beats/min, but for persons over age 60 it is 5–8 beats/min. Heart rate variation with deep breathing (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) is abolished by the muscarinic ACh receptor antagonist atropine but is unaffected by sympathetic postganglionic blockade (e.g., propranolol).

Valsalva Response This response (Table 454-7) assesses the integrity of the baroreflex control of heart rate (parasympathetic) and BP (adrenergic). Under normal conditions, increases in BP at the carotid bulb trigger a reduction in heart rate (increased vagal tone), and decreases in BP trigger an increase in heart rate (reduced vagal tone). The Valsalva response is tested in the supine position. The subject exhales against a closed glottis (or into a manometer maintaining a constant expiratory pressure of 40 mmHg) for 15 s while measuring changes in heart rate and beat-to-beat BP. There are four phases of the BP and heart rate response to the Valsalva maneuver. Phases I and III are mechanical and related to changes in intrathoracic and intraabdominal pressure. In early phase II, reduced venous return results in a fall in stroke volume and BP, counteracted by a combination of reflex tachycardia and increased total peripheral resistance. Increased total peripheral resistance arrests the BP drop ~5–8 s after the onset of the maneuver. Late phase II begins with a progressive rise in BP toward or above baseline. Venous return and cardiac output return to normal in phase

The diagnosis is one of exclusion, and care should be taken to ensure that patients do not have intermittent dizziness due to TIA. In patients < 50 years of age, a history of recent trauma or of severe, abrupt-onset, or persistent pain (> 72 hours) should raise concern for vertebral artery dissection with TIAs.

A brain MRI with vascular imaging (e.g., MRA) is sometimes indicated to assess potential intracranial pathology, particularly cerebrovascular disease.

Episodic ataxia type 2 can be corroborated by genetic testing.

Presyncope is described as a feeling of imminent loss of consciousness without actual fainting. Commonly confused with seizures.

Hx/PE:

Patients may report a trigger (e.g., standing for long period of time, fear/sight of blood, Valsalva maneuver).

Ménière’s disease consists of recurrent episodes, but unlike BPPV, these usually last hours to days.

Unlike Ménière’s, vestibular migraine usually has no associated auditory or aural symptoms.

Rule out vertebral artery dissection in those with persistent head or neck pain and intermittent isolated dizziness or vertigo.

■Typically follows a prodrome of lightheadedness or dizziness, muff ed sounds, constricting vision, diffuse weakness, diaphoresis, or pallor. Leads to loss of consciousness and muscle tone for < 30 seconds and recovery within seconds.

Acute-onset abdominal pain has many potential etiologies and may require immediate medical or surgical intervention. Sharp, focal pain generally implies a parietal (peritoneal) etiology; dull, diffuse pain is commonly of visceral (organ) origin. Figure 2.17-2 identifies the common causes of acute abdomen.

Obtain a complete history, including the elements indicated in the mnemonic OPQRST.

Obtain a full gynecologic history for females (including last menstrual period, pregnancy, and any STD symptoms). If a female has abdominal pain with cervical motion tenderness, there should be a low threshold to treat for pelvic inﬂammatory disease (PID).

Perforation leads to sudden onset of diffuse, severe pain, usually with abdominal rigidity on exam.

Obstruction leads to acute onset of severe, radiating, colicky pain. Patients may complain of obstipation or bilious emesis.

Inﬂ ammation leads to gradual onset (over 10–12 hours) of constant, illdefined pain.

A 32-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with weakness and hypokalemia. The patient had been very healthy until 2 months previously when he developed intermittent leg weakness. His review of systems was otherwise negative. He denied drug or laxative abuse and was on no medications. Past medical history was unremarkable, with no history of neuromuscular disease. Family history was notable for a sister with thyroid disease. Physical examination was notable only for reduced deep tendon reflexes.

Sodium 139 143 meq/L Potassium 2.0 3.8 meq/L Chloride 105 107 meq/L Bicarbonate 26 29 meq/L BUN 11 16 mg/dL Creatinine 0.6 1.0 mg/dL Calcium 8.8 8.8 mg/dL Phosphate 1.2 mg/dL Albumin 3.8 meq/L TSH 0.08 μIU/L (normal 0.2–5.39) Free T4 41 pmol/L (normal 10–27)

This patient developed hypokalemia due to a redistribution of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular compartments; this pathophysiology was readily apparent following calculation of the TTKG. The TTKG is calculated as (P × U )/(P ×

U ). The expected values for the TTKG are <3 in the presence of hypokalemia and >7–8 in the presence of hyperkalemia (see also Case 2 and Case 8). Alternatively, a urinary K+-to-creatinine ratio of >13 mmol/g creatinine (>1.5 mmol/mmol creatinine) is compatible with excessive renal K+ excretion. In this case, the calculated TTKG was 2.5, consistent with appropriate renal conservation of K+ and a nonrenal cause for hypokalemia. In the absence of significant gastrointestinal loss of K+, the patient was diagnosed with a “redistributive” subtype of hypokalemia.

The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly.

The plasma Na+ concentration on admission was 113 meq/L, with a creatinine of 2.35 (Table 64e-1). At hospital hour 7, the plasma Na+ concentration was 120 meq/L, potassium 5.4 meq/L, chloride 90 64e-5 meq/L, bicarbonate 22 meq/L, BUN 32 mg/dL, creatinine 2.02 mg/dL, glucose 89 mg/dL, total protein 5.0, and albumin 1.9. The hematocrit was 33.9, white count 7.6, and platelets 405. A morning cortisol was 19.5, with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 1.7. The patient was treated with 1 μg of intravenous DDAVP, along with 75 mL/h of intravenous half-normal saline. After the plasma Na+ concentration dropped to 116 meq/L, intravenous fluid was switched to normal saline at the same infusion rate. The subsequent results are shown in Table 64e-1.

This patient presented with hypovolemic hyponatremia and a “prerenal” reduction in GFR, with an increase in serum creatinine. She had experienced diarrhea for some time and manifested an orthostatic tachycardia after a liter of normal saline. As expected for hypovolemic hyponatremia, the urine Na+ concentration was <20 meq/L in the absence of congestive heart failure or other causes of hypervolemic hyponatremia, and she responded to saline hydration with an increase in plasma Na+ concentration and a decrease in creatinine.

Hemodialysis is the most effective and reliable method to reduce plasma K+ concentration; peritoneal dialysis is considerably less effective. Patients with acute kidney injury require temporary, urgent venous access for hemodialysis, with the attendant risks; in contrast, patients with ESRD or advanced chronic kidney disease may have a preexisting venous access. The amount of K+ removed during hemodialysis depends on the relative distribution of K+ between ICF and ECF (potentially affected by prior therapy for hyperkalemia), the type and surface area of the dialyzer used, dialysate and blood flow rates, dialysate flow rate, dialysis duration, and the plasma-to-dialysate K+ gradient.

Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalances and Acid-Base Disturbances: Case Examples David B. Mount, Thomas D. DuBose, Jr. CASE 1 64e

A 23-year-old woman was admitted with a 3-day history of fever, cough productive of blood-tinged sputum, confusion, and orthostasis. Past medical history included type 1 diabetes mellitus. A physical examination in the emergency department indicated postural hypo-tension, tachycardia, and Kussmaul respiration. The breath was noted to smell of “acetone.” Examination of the thorax suggested consolidation in the right lower lobe.

The diagnosis of the acid-base disorder should proceed in a stepwise fashion: 1.

The normal anion gap (AG) is 8–10 meq/L, but in this case, the AG is elevated (20 meq/L). Therefore, the change in AG (ΔAG) = ~10 meq/L.

The clinical impetus for screening mammogra-phy came from the Health Insurance Plan study and the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project, which demonstrated a 33% reduction in mortality for women after72 screening mam-mography. Mammography was more accurate than clinical examination for the detection of early breast cancers, providing a true-positive rate of 90%. Only 20% of women with nonpal-pable cancers had axillary lymph node metastases, compared with 50% of women with palpable cancers.141 Current guide-lines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network suggest that normal-risk women ≥20 years of age should have a breast examination at

The standard screening modalities of mammography and physical examination are complementary. Approximately 10% to 50% of cancers detected mammographically are not palpable, whereas physical examination detects 10% to 20% of cancers not seen radiographically (17). The purpose of screening is to detect tumors when they are small (<1 cm) and have the highest potential for surgical cure. Most trials show a 20% to 30% reduction in breast cancer mortality for women age 50 and older who undergo annual screening mammography. Data on screening women younger than 40 years are more controversial. Results from the Gothenburg screening trial showed a 45% reduction in mortality for women screened between the ages of 40 and 49 (18). Because of these findings, it is recommended that all women undergo yearly screening mammography starting at age 40, along with clinical breast examination at least every 3 years (19). Monthly breast self-examination (BSE) is no longer recommended because there is little evidence to show that BSE is superior to heightened breast awareness such that any new symptoms related to the breast in daily activities would be reported promptly when noticed. BSE was not shown to improve survival. Women should be informed about the benefits and limitations of monthly BSE, mainly the risk of a false-positive result. Women who would still prefer to perform BSE should be instructed in the technique and occasionally have their technique reviewed. No other tests, including ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) scans, sestamibi scans, positron emission tomography (PET) scans, or serum blood markers, have been shown to be effective screening modalities. Screening guidelines recommended by the American College of Radiology and the American Cancer Society are presented in Table 40.1. In 2010, the ACS recommended annual screening mammography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) starting at age 30 for women with a known BRCA mutation and other high-risk genetic syndromes, women who are untested with a first-degree relative with the BRCA mutation and women with an approximately 20% to 25% or greater lifetime risk of breast cancer, or women who have been treated with radiation for Hodgkin’s lymphoma (19). Although breast MRI may prove to be advantageous for other women with an elevated risk of breast cancer, there

Menopause Although menopause was assumed for many years to be associated with an increased incidence of depression, empirical studies led to conﬂicting results and controversy. Menopause appears to have mood effects in some women that can be differentiated from the secondary effects, such as hot ﬂashes interfering with sleep. Psychosocial studies indicate that some patients are upset by their loss of fertility or the departure of grown children from the home (empty nest syndrome), but many women find menopause liberating (98,99). For some women the return of adult children to the maternal home, or responsibilities for the care of grandchildren, seems to be a precipitating factor for depression. Patients who suffered PMS or postpartum depression may be vulnerable to a recurrence of depression at this new time of hormonal change. Patients with depression at the time of menopause should be assessed for psychosocial precipitants and domestic abuse. There are conﬂicting reports on the effectiveness of hormones for treatment of mood symptoms during menopause (100–105). Treatment with SSRIs may ameliorate hot ﬂashes (106).

Depression in elderly patients can cause a pseudodementia, characterized by decreased activity and interest and what appears to be forgetfulness. Unlike patients with genuine dementia, these patients report memory loss rather than trying to compensate and cover up for it. The early stages of dementia can precipitate depression as patients react to the loss of cognitive abilities (107).

document (1) 

A sense of unreality

Fear of going crazy or dying

Chills or hot ﬂashes The attacks can recur with or without specific precipitating events (148). The patient is preoccupied with them and makes behavioral changes she hopes will avert future attacks: avoiding specific situations, assuring herself there is an escape route from certain situations, or refusing to be alone.

The symptoms of panic attacks are often confused with the symptoms of cardiac or pulmonary disease. They lead to many fruitless trips to the emergency department and to costly, even invasive, medical investigations. A careful history can establish the correct diagnosis in most cases (153–155).

Agoraphobia Agoraphobia is the avoidance of situations in which the patient fears she may be trapped, such as the center of a row in the theater or driving over a bridge. She fears that such a situation will trigger anxiety or a panic attack and therefore tends more and more to stay at home or limit her sphere of activity to an increasingly short list of venues. Agoraphobia and panic disorder can occur separately or together (150–154).

Specific Phobias Specific phobias are irrational fears of certain objects or situations, although the patient recognizes that the object or situation poses no real danger. Of particular concern in gynecology are fear of needles and fear of vomiting (150).

Social phobia causes the patient to fear and avoid situations in which the patient anticipates, without rational cause, that she will be perceived in a humiliating light. Such situations include giving a business-related presentation, making an announcement at a meeting, and having a casual dinner with friends. Patients may alter their lives to avoid these anxieties, interfering with their interpersonal relationships and their ability to carry out their responsibilities, or they may manage to carry on despite considerable psychological pain (150).

drug treatment should be avoided because it may prolong or aggravate delirium in some cases. The treatment of choice is low-dose haloperidol. It remains difficult to reduce delirium in patients with acute illness or other stressful conditions. Interventions based on dietary supplementation or careful use of pain medications and sedatives in preand postoperative older patients have been only partially successful.

document (3) 

Treatment of GERD is multifaceted with lifestyle modification and use of antacids and over-the-counter H2 receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors (PPI). Lifestyle modifications include smoking cessation, avoidance of eating late in the evening, avoidance of being supine after eating, weight loss, avoidance of tight clothing, and restriction of alcohol use. Dietary modifications are helpful but should not be draconian, which will ensure noncompliance. Key foods to try to minimize are fatty foods, chocolate, peppermint, and excessive alcohol. The patient can monitor her own symptoms for the foods that are most problematic for her.

Medications that reduce acid secretions are best and include H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors. They do not prevent the reﬂux but decrease the damage done by the acid when reﬂuxed. Medication needs to be titrated to the severity of the symptoms. H2 blockers commonly work well for acute pain but in placebo-controlled studies in chronic cases without resolution of heartburn after the common 6-week course, it was found that patients on PPI do better. Maintenance therapy is recommended for patients who have rapid recurrence of symptoms (in less than 2–3 months) after they stop their medication. Otherwise patients can be managed with episodic treatments. The linkage of Helicobacter pylori infections and GERD is poorly understood but seems to be mediated through increased gastric acid secretion. Treatment can initially worsen GERD and may not improve it (62). Benefits and risks should be discussed with the patient prior to testing and treating for H. pylori. The management of GERD during pregnancy is similar to the treatment in the nonpregnant patient.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the cluster of symptoms brought on by compression in the carpal tunnel of the median nerve. These are paresthesia, pain, and weakness. The symptoms are commonly worse at night and may wake the patient from sleep. It is thought women may be more likely to present with complaints of CTS because of their small wrists, repetitive motion injury at work (typing, holding telephone, and reading), and pregnancy with increased edema. The pain and paresthesia can be located in the wrist or hand or can be in the forearm. The weakness may cause a patient to have difficulty opening jars, lifting a plate, turning a doorknob, or holding a glass.

Predominantly a clinical diagnosis; routine cases do not need blood work or a CXR.

CXR may be obtained to rule out pneumonia and may show hyperinﬂ ation of the lungs with ﬂattened diaphragms, interstitial infiltrates, and atelectasis.

Nasopharyngeal aspirate to test for RSV is highly sensitive and specific but has little effect on management (infants should be treated for bronchiolitis regardless of whether RSV is or not).

Treatment is primarily supportive; treat mild disease with outpatient management using ﬂuids and nebulizers if needed.

Hospitalize in the setting of marked respiratory distress, O2 saturation of < 92%, toxic appearance, dehydration/poor oral feeding, a history of prematurity (< 34 weeks), age < 3 months, underlying cardiopulmonary disease, or unreliable parents.

Treat inpatients with contact isolation, hydration, and O2. A trial of aerosolized albuterol may be attempted; continue albuterol therapy only if effective.

RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis.

Ribavirin is an antiviral drug that has a controversial role in bronchiolitis treatment. It is sometimes used in high-risk infants with underlying heart, lung, or immune disease.

RSV prophylaxis with injectable polyor monoclonal antibodies (RespiGam or Synagis) is recommended in winter for high-risk patients ≤ 2 years of age (e.g., those with a history of prematurity, chronic lung disease, or congenital heart disease).

An acute viral inﬂammatory disease of the larynx, primarily within the subglottic space. Pathogens include parainf uenza virus type 1 (most common), 2, and 3; RSV; inﬂuenza; and adenovirus. Bacterial superinfection may progress to tracheitis.

Prodromal URI symptoms are typically followed by low-grade fever, mild dyspnea, inspiratory stridor that worsens with agitation, a hoarse voice, and a characteristic barking cough (usually at night).

Kernig’s sign (pain on knee extension when the hip is ﬂexed) and Brudzinski’s sign (pain with passive neck ﬂexion) are nonspecific signs of meningeal irritation.

Head CT to rule out ↑ ICP (risk of brain stem herniation).

Perform an LP; send cell count with differential, glucose and protein levels, Gram stain, and culture.

Empiric antibiotic therapy regimens (ceftriaxone, vancomycin, ampicillin) should be administered until bacterial meningitis can be excluded.

Neonates should receive ampicillin and cefotaxime or gentamicin. Consider acyclovir if there is concern for herpes encephalitis (e.g., if the mother had HSV lesions at the time of the infant’s birth).

Older children should receive ceftriaxone and vancomycin.

A bacterial infection caused by Bordetella pertussis (whooping cough), a grambacillus. The DTaP vaccine (given in five doses in early childhood) is protective, but immunity wanes by adolescence. Adolescents and young adults serve as the primary reservoir for pertussis. Pertussis can be life threatening for young infants but is generally a milder infection in older children and adults.

Has three stages: (1) catarrhal (mild URI symptoms; lasts 1–2 weeks), (2) paroxysmal (paroxysms of cough with inspiratory whoop and post-tussive emesis; lasts 2–3 months), and (3) convalescent (symptoms wane).

Patients most often present in the paroxysmal stage but are most contagious in the catarrhal stage.

The classic presentation is an infant < 6 months of age with post-tussive emesis and apnea.

The primary sign of laryngomalacia is inspiratory stridorwith little or no expiratory component. The stridor is typically loudest when the infant is feeding or active and decreases when the infant is relaxed or placed prone, or when the neck is flexed. Any condition that increases upper airway inflammation will exacerbate laryngomalacia, including viral respiratory infections, dysphagia (swallowing dysfunction), and gastroesophageal reflux. Laryngomalacia normally peaks by 3 to 5 months of age and resolves between 6 and 12 months of age. However, occasionally it can persist in otherwise normal children up until 24 months of age and even longer in children with underlying conditions, especially those with neurologic diseases affecting control of upper airway muscles (such as cerebral palsy).

In many infants with presumed laryngomalacia, the diagnosis can be tentatively established by history and physical examination. If the patient follows the typical course for laryngomalacia, then no further workup is necessary. However, to firmly establish the diagnosis, which is important in more severe or atypical cases, the patient should undergo flexible nasopharyngoscopy to assess the patency and dynamic movement (collapse) of the larynx and surrounding structures. This procedure can also identify vocal cord abnormalities and airway lesions above the vocal cords.

In most cases, no therapy is required for laryngomalacia. The infant should be observed closely during times of respiratory infection for evidence of respiratory compromise. Infants with severe laryngomalacia resulting in hypoventilation, hypoxia, or growth failure may benefit from a surgical procedure (aryepiglottoplasty) or, in extreme cases, a tracheostomy to bypass the upper airway.

Subglottic stenosis is the narrowing of the portion of the trachea immediately below the vocal cords. It may be congenital but more often is acquired. Endotracheal intubation, especially prolonged or repeated intubation required in some premature infants, can lead to inflammation and scarring of the subglottic space.

Clinical Manifestations and Diagnosis Epiglottitis typically presents more acutely in young children than in adolescents or adults. On presentation, most children have had symptoms for <24 h, including high fever, severe sore throat, tachycardia, systemic toxicity, and (in many cases) drooling while sitting forward. Symptoms and signs of respiratory obstruction also may be present and may progress rapidly. The somewhat milder illness in adolescents and adults often follows 1–2 days of severe sore throat and is commonly accompanied by dyspnea, drooling, and stridor. Physical examination of patients with acute epiglottitis may reveal moderate or

may reveal moderate or severe respiratory distress, with inspiratory stridor and retractions of the chest wall. These findings diminish as the disease progresses and the patient tires. Conversely, oropharyngeal examination reveals infection that is much less severe than would be predicted from the symptoms—a finding that should alert the clinician to a cause of symptoms and obstruction that lies beyond the tonsils. The diagnosis often is made on clinical grounds, although direct fiberoptic laryngoscopy is frequently performed in a controlled environment (e.g., an operating room) to visualize and culture the typical edematous “cherry-red”

typical edematous “cherry-red” epiglottis and facilitate placement of an endotracheal tube. Direct visualization in an examination room (i.e., with a tongue blade and indirect laryngoscopy) is not recommended because of the risk of immediate laryngospasm and complete airway obstruction. Lateral neck radiographs and laboratory tests can assist in the diagnosis but may delay the critical securing of the airway and cause the patient to be moved or repositioned more than is necessary, thereby increasing the risk of further airway compromise.

Bleeding from right colonic vascular ectasias in the elderly may be overt or occult; it tends to be chronic and only occasionally is hemodynamically significant. Endoscopic hemostatic therapy may be useful in the treatment of vascular ectasias, as well as discrete bleeding ulcers and postpolypectomy bleeding. Surgical therapy is generally required for major, persistent, or recurrent bleeding from the wide variety of colonic sources of GIB that cannot be treated medically, angiographically, or endoscopically.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT:

Measurement of the heart rate and blood pressure is the best way to initially assess a patient with GIB. Clinically significant bleeding leads to postural changes in heart rate or blood pressure, tachycardia, and, finally, recumbent hypotension. In contrast, the hemoglobin does not fall immediately with acute GIB, due to proportionate reductions in plasma and red cell volumes (i.e., “people bleed whole blood”). Thus, hemoglobin may be normal or only minimally decreased at the initial presentation of a severe bleeding episode. As extravascular fluid enters the vascular space to restore volume, the hemoglobin falls, but this process may take up to 72 h. Transfusion is recommended when the hemoglobin drops below 7 g/dL, based on a large randomized trial showing this restrictive transfusion strategy decreases rebleeding and death in acute UGIB compared with a transfusion threshold of 9 g/dL. Patients with slow, chronic GIB may have very low hemoglobin values despite normal blood pressure and heart rate. With the development of iron-deficiency anemia, the mean corpuscular volume will be low and red blood cell distribution width will increase.

The degree of clotting dysfunction also varies and can be serious and life threatening, especially if operative delivery is undertaken. Coagulopathy is caused by diminished hepatic procoagulant synthesis, although some evidence supports increased consumption from disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. As shown in Table 55-2, hypoibrinogenemia sometimes is profound. Of 51 women with fatty liver cared for at Parkland Hospital, almost a third had a plasma fibrinogen level nadir to < 100 mg/dL (Nelson, 2014). Modest level elevations of serum D-dimers or fibrin-split products indicate an element of consumptive coagulopathy. Although usually modest, occasionally thrombocytopenia is marked (see Table 55-2).

Primary therapy consists of clot dissolution with pharmacomechanical therapy that usually includes low-dose catheter-directed thrombolysis. This approach is reserved for patients with extensive femoral, iliofemoral, or upper extremity DVT. The open vein hypothesis postulates that patients who receive primary therapy will sustain less long-term damage to venous valves, with consequent lower rates of postthrombotic syndrome. A National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute–sponsored randomized controlled trial called ATTRACT (NCT00790335) is testing this hypothesis.

Anticoagulation or placement of an inferior vena caval filter constitutes secondary prevention of VTE. To lessen the severity of post-thrombotic syndrome of the legs, below-knee graduated compression stockings may be prescribed, 30–40 mmHg, for 2 years after the DVT episode. They should be replaced every 3 months because they lose their elasticity.

due to RV microinfarction portend a high risk of an adverse clinical outcome. When RV function remains normal in a hemodynamically stable patient, a good clinical outcome is highly likely with anticoagulation alone (Fig. 300-7).

A bleeding score has been validated as a tool to predict patients more likely to have type 1 VWD (International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis Bleeding Assessment Tool [www.isth .org/resource/resmgr/ssc/isth-ssc_bleeding_assessment.pdf ]). This is most useful tool in excluding the diagnosis of a bleeding disorder, and thus avoiding unnecessary testing. One study found that a low bleeding score (≤3) and a normal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) had 99.6% negative predictive value for the diagnosis of VWD. Bleeding symptoms that appear to be more common in patients with bleeding disorders include prolonged bleeding with surgery, dental procedures and extractions, and/or trauma, menorrhagia or postpartum hemorrhage, and large bruises (often described with lumps).

Easy bruising and menorrhagia are common complaints in patients with and without bleeding disorders. Easy bruising can also be a sign of medical conditions in which there is no identifiable coagulopathy; instead, the conditions are caused by an abnormality of blood vessels or their supporting tissues. In Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, there may be posttraumatic bleeding and a history of joint hyperextensibility. Cushing’s syndrome, chronic steroid use, and aging result in changes in skin and subcutaneous tissue, and subcutaneous bleeding occurs in response to minor trauma. The latter has been termed senile purpura.

A 52-year-old woman visited her family physician with complaints of increasing lethargy and vomiting. The physician examined her and noted that compared to previous visits she had lost significant weight. She was also jaundiced, and on examination of the abdomen a well-defined 10-cm rounded mass was palpable below the liver edge in the right upper quadrant (Fig. 4.185).

The clinical diagnosis was carcinoma of the head of the pancreas.

It is difficult to appreciate how such a precise diagnosis can be made clinically when only three clinical signs have been described.

The patient’s obstruction was in the distal bile duct.

When a patient has jaundice, the causes are excessive breakdown of red blood cells (prehepatic), hepatic failure (hepatic jaundice), and posthepatic causes, which include obstruction along the length of the biliary tree.

The patient had a mass in her right upper quadrant that was palpable below the liver; this was the gallbladder.

In healthy individuals, the gallbladder is not palpable. An expanded gallbladder indicates obstruction either within the cystic duct or below the level of the cystic duct insertion (i.e., the bile duct).

The patient’s vomiting was related to the position of the tumor.

It is not uncommon for vomiting and weight loss (cachexia) to occur in patients with a malignant disease. The head of the pancreas lies within the curve of the duodenum, primarily adjacent to the descending part of the duodenum. Any tumor mass in the region of the head of the pancreas is likely to expand and may encase and invade the duodenum. Unfortunately, in this patient’s case, this happened, producing almost complete obstruction. Further discussion with the patient revealed that she was vomiting relatively undigested food soon after each meal.

A CT scan demonstrated further complications.

Chronic hepatitis is an important late complication of acute hepatitis B occurring in a small proportion of patients with acute disease but more common in those who present with chronic infection without having experienced an acute illness, as occurs typically after neonatal infection or after infection in an immunosuppressed host (Chap. 362). The following clinical and laboratory features suggest progression of acute hepatitis to chronic hepatitis: (1) lack of complete resolution of clinical symptoms of anorexia, weight loss, fatigue, and the persistence of hepatomegaly; (2) the presence of bridging/interface or multilobular hepatic necrosis on liver biopsy during protracted, severe acute viral hepatitis; (3) failure of the serum aminotransferase, bilirubin, and globulin levels to return to normal within 6–12 months after the acute illness; and (4) the persistence of HBeAg for >3 months or HBsAg for >6 months after acute hepatitis.

Although acute hepatitis D infection does not increase the likelihood of chronicity of simultaneous acute hepatitis B, hepatitis D has the potential for contributing to the severity of chronic hepatitis B. Hepatitis D superinfection can transform inactive or mild chronic hepatitis B into severe, progressive chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis; it also can accelerate the course of chronic hepatitis B. Some HDV superinfections in patients with chronic hepatitis B lead to fulminant hepatitis. As defined in longitudinal studies over three decades, the annual rates of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic hepatitis D are 4% and 2.8%, respectively. Although HDV and HBV infections are associated with severe liver disease, mild hepatitis and even inactive carriage have been identified in some patients, and the disease may become indolent beyond the early years of infection.

Neoplasia Abnormal bleeding is the most frequent symptom of women with invasive cervical cancer. A visible cervical lesion should be evaluated by biopsy rather than awaiting the results of cervical cytology testing, because the results of cervical cytology testing may be falsely negative with invasive lesions as a result of tumor necrosis. Unopposed estrogen is associated with a variety of abnormalities of the endometrium, from cystic hyperplasia to adenomatous hyperplasia, hyperplasia with cytologic atypia, and invasive carcinoma. Although vaginal neoplasia is uncommon, the vagina should be evaluated carefully when abnormal bleeding is present. Attention should be directed to all surfaces of the vagina, including anterior and posterior areas that may be obscured by the vaginal speculum on examination.

For all women, the evaluation of excessive and abnormal menses includes a thorough medical and gynecologic history, the exclusion of pregnancy, the consideration of possible malignancy, and a careful gynecologic examination. For women of normal weight between the ages of approximately 20 and 35 years who do not have clear risk factors for STDs, who have no signs of androgen excess, who are not using exogenous hormones, and who have no other findings on examination, management may be based on a clinical diagnosis. Additional laboratory or imaging studies may be indicated if the diagnosis is not apparent on the basis of examination and history.

Laboratory Studies In any patient with heavy menstrual bleeding, an objective measurement of hematologic status should be performed with a complete blood count to detect anemia or thrombocytopenia. A pregnancy test should be performed to rule out pregnancy-related problems. In addition, because of the possibility of a primary coagulation problem, screening coagulation studies should be considered (Table 14.8). The consensus report of an international expert panel recommends measurement of CBC, platelet count and function, PT, activated PTT, VWF (measured with ristocetin cofactor activity and antigen, factor VIII) and fibrinogen to be assessed in collaboration with a hematologist (81).

The median presenting leukocyte count is about 15,000/μL. Between 25 and 40% of patients have counts <5000/μL, and 20% have counts >100,000/μL. Fewer than 5% have no detectable leukemic cells in the blood. The morphology of the malignant cell varies in different subsets. In AML, the cytoplasm often contains primary (nonspecific) granules, and the nucleus shows fine, lacy chromatin with one or more nucleoli characteristic of immature cells. Abnormal rod-shaped granules called Auer rods are not uniformly present, but when they are, myeloid lineage is virtually certain (Fig. 132-1). Poor neutrophil function may be noted functionally by impaired phagocytosis and migration and morphologically by abnormal lobulation and deficient granulation.

Platelet counts <100,000/μL are found at diagnosis in ~75% of patients, and about 25% have counts <25,000/μL. Both morphologic and functional platelet abnormalities can be observed, including large and bizarre shapes with abnormal granulation and inability of platelets to aggregate or adhere normally to one another.

Pretreatment Evaluation Once the diagnosis of AML is suspected, a rapid evaluation and initiation of appropriate therapy should follow. In addition to clarifying the subtype of leukemia, initial studies should evaluate the overall functional integrity of the major organ systems, including the cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, and renal systems (Table 132-4). Factors that have prognostic significance, either for achieving CR or for predicting the duration of CR, should also be assessed before initiating treatment, including cytogenetics and molecular markers (see above). Leukemic cells should be obtained from all patients and cryopreserved for future use as new tests and therapeutics become available. All patients should be evaluated for infection.

Most patients are anemic and thrombocytopenic at presentation. Replacement of the appropriate blood components, if necessary, should begin promptly. Because qualitative platelet dysfunction or the presence of an infection may increase the likelihood of bleeding, evidence of hemorrhage justifies the immediate use of platelet transfusion, even if the platelet count is only moderately decreased.

LABORATORY STUDIES Blood Anemia is present in most cases, either alone or as part of bi-or pancytopenia; isolated neutropenia or thrombocytopenia is more unusual. Macrocytosis is common, and the smear may be dimorphic with a distinctive population of large red blood cells. Platelets are also large and lack granules. In functional studies, they may show marked abnormalities, and patients may have bleeding symptoms despite seemingly adequate numbers. Neutrophils are hypogranulated; have hyposegmented, ringed, or abnormally segmented nuclei; contain Döhle bodies; and may be functionally deficient. Circulating myeloblasts usually correlate with marrow blast numbers, and their quantity is important for classification and prognosis. The total white blood cell count (WBC) is usually normal or low, except in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. As in aplastic anemia, MDS can be associated with a clonal population of PNH cells. Genetic testing is commercially available for constitutional syndromes.

Bone Marrow The bone marrow is usually normal or hypercellular, but in about 20% of cases, it is sufficiently hypocellular to be confused with aplasia. No single characteristic feature of marrow morphology distinguishes MDS, but the following are commonly observed: dyserythropoietic changes (especially nuclear abnormalities) and ringed sideroblasts in the erythroid lineage; hypogranulation and hyposegmentation in granulocytic precursors, with an increase in myeloblasts; and megakaryocytes showing reduced numbers of or disorganized aGood, normal, –Y, del(5q), del (20q); poor, complex (≥3 abnormalities) or chromosome 7 abnormalities; intermediate, all other abnormalities. bCytopenias defined as hemoglobin <100 g/L, platelet count <100,000/μL, and absolute neutrophil count <1500/μL.

Therapy for pneumonia includes supportive and specific treatment and depends on the degree of illness, complications, and knowledge of the infectious agent likely causing the pneumonia. Most cases of pneumonia in healthy children can be managed on an outpatient basis. However children with hypoxemia, inability to maintain adequate hydration, or moderate to severe respiratory distress should be hospitalized. Hospitalization should be considered in infants under 6 months with suspected bacterial pneumonia, those in whom there is a concern for a pathogen with increased virulence (e.g., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), or when concern exists about a family’s ability to care for the child and to assess symptom progression.

Because viruses cause most community-acquired pneumonias in young children, not all children require empirical antibiotic treatment for pneumonia. Recommended therapies in those without recent antibiotic exposure are listed in Table 110-1. Exceptional situations include lack of response to empirical therapy, unusually severe presentations, nosocomial pneumonia, and immunocompromised children susceptible to infections with opportunistic pathogens (Table 110-3). In contrast to pneumococcal meningitis, presumed pneumococcal pneumonia can be treated with high-dose cephalosporin therapy even with high-level penicillin resistance. Vancomycin can be used if the isolate shows high-level resistance and the patient is severely ill. For infants 4 to 18 weeks old with afebrile pneumonia most likely caused by C. trachomatis, a macrolide is the recommended treatment. Oseltamivir or zanamivir should be used if influenza is identified or suspected, ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset.

Initially, viral infection involves the ciliated 1211 columnar epithelial cells, but it may also involve other respiratory tract cells, including alveolar cells, mucous gland cells, and macrophages. In infected cells, virus replicates within 4–6 h, after which infectious virus is released to infect adjacent or nearby cells. In this way, infection spreads from a few foci to a large number of respiratory cells over several hours. In experimentally induced infection, the incubation period of illness has ranged from 18 to 72 h, depending on the size of the viral inoculum. Histopathologic study reveals degenerative changes, including granulation, vacuolization, swelling, and pyknotic nuclei in infected ciliated cells. The cells eventually become necrotic and desquamate; in some areas, previously columnar epithelium is replaced by flattened and metaplastic epithelial cells. The severity of illness is correlated with the quantity of virus shed in secretions; thus, the degree of viral replication itself may be an important factor in pathogenesis. Despite the frequent development of systemic signs and symptoms such as fever, headache, and myalgias, influenza virus has only rarely been detected in extrapulmonary sites (including the bloodstream). Evidence suggests that the pathogenesis of systemic symptoms in influenza may be related to the induction of certain cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor α, interferon α, interleukin 6, and interleukin 8, in respiratory secretions and in the bloodstream.

The well-known uncomplicated febrile seizure, specific to infants and children between 6 months and 5 years of age (peak incidence ages 9 to 20 months) and with a strong inherited tendency, is generally regarded as a benign condition. The frequency has been estimated to be approximately 4 per 1,000 children under the age of 5 but reportedly twice as high in Japanese children. It usually takes the form of a single, generalized motor seizure occurring as the patient’s core temperature rises or reaches its peak. Seldom does the seizure last longer than a few minutes and by the time an EEG can be obtained, there is no abnormality and recovery is complete. The seizures do not recur during the same episode of fever. The temperature is usually above 38°C (100.4°F).

Any viral or bacterial illness, or, rarely, an immunization, may be the precipitant of the fever; herpesvirus 6 is one of the common precipitants, probably because of its tendency to cause high fever. Prophylactic antiepileptic drugs have not been found to be helpful in preventing febrile seizures. Except for a presumed genetic relationship with benign epilepsy of childhood (Luders et al), which in itself is transient in nature, these patients’ risk of developing epilepsy in later life is only slightly greater than that of the general population. In some families, such as those studied by Nabbout and colleagues, febrile seizures alone, without generalized epilepsy, have been associated with a particular gene by linkage analysis. Presumably, when the gene products are identified, some insight into the nature of defects that lower the seizure threshold will be forthcoming.

Transmission of M. tuberculosis is from person to person, usually by respiratory droplets that become airborne when the ill individual coughs, sneezes, laughs, sighs, or breathes. Infected droplets dry and become droplet nuclei, which may remain suspended in the air for hours, long after the infectious person has left the environment.

Several patient-related factors are associated with an increased chance of transmission. Of these a positive acid-fast smear of the sputum most closely correlates with infectivity. Children with primary pulmonary tuberculosis disease rarely, if ever, infect other children or adults. Tubercle bacilli are relatively sparse in the endobronchial secretions of children with primary pulmonary tuberculosis, and a significant cough is usually lacking. When young children cough, they rarely produce sputum, lacking the tussive force necessary to project and suspend infectious particles of the requisite size. Hospitalized children with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis are placed initially in respiratory isolation. Most infectious patients become noninfectious within 2 weeks of starting effective treatment, and many become noninfectious within several days.

In North America, tuberculosis rates are highest in for-eign-born persons from high-prevalence countries, residents of prisons, residents of nursing homes, homeless persons, users of illegal drugs, persons who are poor and medically indigent, health care workers, and children exposed to adults in high-risk groups. Among U.S. urban dwellers with tuberculosis, persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and racial minorities are overrepresented. Most children are infected with M. tuberculosis from household contacts, but outbreaks of childhood tuberculosis centered in elementary and high schools, nursery schools, family day care homes, churches, school buses, and stores still occur. A high-risk adult working in the area has been the source of the outbreak in most cases.

The patient has been breastfed since birth, and usually feeds for 30 minutes every 2-3 hours. The patient’s mother is concerned that her milk production is not keeping up with the patient’s nutritional requirements. She reports that about two weeks ago the patient began regurgitating breastmilk through his nose and mouth after some feeds. She reports that he seems mildly upset during the episodes of regurgitation but usually settles down quickly and is hungry again soon afterwards. The patient’s mother has already tried limiting the volume of each feed, which seems to have reduced the frequency of the regurgitation. She denies any diarrhea, hematochezia, or family history of food allergies. Her older son had a similar problem with vomiting that resolved around 12 months of age. Four weeks ago, the patient’s height and weight were in the 40th and 34th percentiles, respectively. His height and weight are now respectively in the 37th and 36th percentiles.

In 2016, 81 percent of U.S. newborns were initially breastfed, 52 percent were still breastfed at 6 months, and 31 percent at 1 year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016). According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017 e), exclusive breastfeeding is preferred until 6 months. In many hospitals, breastfeeding begins in the delivery room. Most term newborns thrive best when fed 8 to 12 times daily for approximately 15 minutes each episode. Preterm or growth-restricted newborns require feedings at shorter intervals. Breastfeeding is discussed further in Chapter 36 (p. 656).

Because most neonates actually receive little nutriment for the first 3 or 4 days of life, they progressively lose weight until the flow of maternal milk is established or other feeding is instituted. Preterm neonates lose relatively more weight and regain their birthweight more slowly. Conversely, growth-restricted but otherwise healthy newborns regain their initial weight more quickly than those born preterm. With proper nourishment, birthweight of term newborns usually is regained by 10 days.

For the irst 2 or 3 days after birth, the colon contains sot, brown-green meconium. his consists of desquamated epithelial cells from the intestinal tract, mucus, epidermal cells, and lanugo (fetal hair) that have been swallowed along with amnionic luid.

The characteristic color results from bile pigments. During fetal life and for a few hours after birth, the intestinal contents are sterile, but bacteria quickly colonize the bowel contents.

Meconium stooling is seen in 90 percent of newborns within the irst 24 hours, and most of the rest within 36 hours. Usually, newborns irst void shortly ater birth but may not until the second day. Meconium and urine passage indicates patency of the gastro intestinal and urinary tracts, respectively. Failure of the newborn to stool or urinate ater these times suggests a congenital defect, such as Hirschsprung disease, imperforate anus, or posterior urethral valve. Ater the third or fourth day, as a result of milk ingestion, meconium is replaced by light-yellow, soter, homogenous feces.

Viewed from the perspective of cerebral palsy, just over half of the patients in the Swedish series of Hagberg and Hagberg with spastic diplegia had matrix hemorrhages, leukomalacia (see further on), or both. Congenital hemiplegia or quadriplegia was observed at a lower frequency. In another series of 20 cases of posthemorrhagic hydro-cephalus (Chaplin et al), 40 percent had significant motor deficits and more than 60 percent had IQ scores of less than 85. In an experience with 12 less severely affected surviving cases (mean birth weight 1.8 kg and gestational age of 32.3 weeks), R.D. Adams noted that only 1 had a residual spastic diplegia and 9 had IQs in the low-normal or normal range (personal communication).

The cause of matrix hemorrhage is not entirely clear. In all probability it is related to greatly increased pressure in the thin-walled veins of the germinal matrix coupled with a lack of adequate supporting tissue in these zones. During periods of unstable arterial or venous blood pressure that occur with the pulmonary disorders of immature infants, these thin-walled vessels rupture. These infants are also prone to the development of another characteristic lesion of the cerebral white matter (periventricular leukomalacia; see below), and the neurologic deficits resulting from these two lesions may be additive.

This is the midpoint of pregnancy as estimated from the LMP. The fetus now weighs somewhat more than 300 g, and weight increases substantially in a linear manner. From this point onward, the fetus moves approximately every minute and is active 10 to 30 percent of the day (DiPietro, 2005). Brown fat forms, and the fetal skin becomes less transparent. Downy lanugo covers its entire body, and some scalp hair can be seen. Cochlear function develops between 22 and 25 weeks, and its maturation continues for 6 months after delivery.

The fetus now weighs almost 700 g (Duryea, 2014). he skin is characteristically wrinkled, and fat deposition begins. The head is still comparatively large, and eyebrows and eyelashes are usually recognizable. By 24 weeks, the secretory type II pneumocytes have initiated surfactant secretion (Chap. 32, p. 607). The canalicular period of lung development, during which the bronchi and bronchioles enlarge and alveolar ducts develop, is nearly completed. Despite this, a fetus born at this time will attempt to breathe, but many will die because the terminal sacs, required for gas exchange, have not yet formed. The overall survival rate at 24 weeks is barely above 50 percent, and only approximately 30 percent survive without severe morbidity (Rysavy, 2015). By 26 weeks, the eyes open. Nociceptors are present over all the body, and the neural pain system is developed (Kadic, 2012). The fetal liver and spleen are important sites for hemopoiesis.

The crown-rump length approximates 25 cm, and the fetus weighs about 1100 g. The thin skin is red and covered with vernix caseosa. The pupillary membrane has just disappeared from the eyes. Isolated eye blinking peaks at 28 weeks. The bone marrow becomes the major site of hemopoiesis. he otherwise normal neonate born at this age has a 90-percent chance of survival.without physical or neurological impairment.

Vaccination has reduced the incidence of hepatitis by 95 percent since 1995. In 2014, the rate was 0.4 per 100,000 individuals (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016b). his 27-nm RNA picornavirus is transmitted by the fecal-oral route, usually by ingestion of contaminated food or water. The incubation period is approximately 4 weeks. Individuals shed virus in their feces, and during the relatively brief period of viremia, their blood is also infectious. Signs and symptoms are oten nonspecific and usually mild, although jaundice develops in most patients. Symptoms usually last less than 2 months, although 10 to 15 percent of patients may remain symptomatic or relapse for up to 6 months (Dienstag, 20 15a). Early serological testing identifies IgVl anti-AV antibody, which may persist for several months. During convlescence, IgG antibody predominates, and it persists and provides subsequent immunity. here is no chronic stage of hepatitis A.

Management of hepatitis A in pregnancy includes a balanced diet and diminished physical activity. Women with less severe illness may be managed as outpatients. In developed countries, the efects of hepatitis A on pregnancy outcomes are not dramatic (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2015, 2016). Both perinatal and maternal mortality rates, however, are substantively increased in resource-poor countries. Hepatitis A virus is not teratogenic, and transmission to the fetus is negligible. Preterm birth rates may be increased, and neonatal cholestasis has been reported (Urganci, 2003). Although hepatitis A RNA has been isolated in breast milk, no cases of neonatal hepatitis A have been reported secondary to breastfeeding (Daudi, 2012).

The pain of herniated intervertebral disc varies in severity from a mild aching discomfort to severe knife-like stabs that radiate the length of the leg and are superimposed on a constant intense ache. Sciatic pain is perceived by the patient as originating deep in the buttock and radiating to the posterolateral thigh; it may progress to the calf and ankle—to the medial malleolus (L4), lateral malleolus (L5), or heel (S1). Distal radiation to the foot is infrequent and should raise concern of an alternative process. Abortive forms of sciatica may produce aching discomfort only in the lower buttock or proximal thigh and occasionally only in the lower hamstring or upper calf. With the most severe pain, the patient is forced to stay in bed, avoiding the slightest movement; a cough, sneeze, or strain is intolerable. The most comfortable position is lying on the back with legs flexed at the knees and hips and the shoulders raised on pillows to obliterate the lumbar lordosis. For some patients, a lateral decubitus position is more comfortable. Free fragments of disc that find their way to a lateral and posterior position in the spinal canal may produce the opposite situation, one whereby the patient is unable to extend the spine and lie supine. Sitting and standing up from a sitting position are particularly painful. It is surprising to patients that a lumbar disc protrusion may cause little or no back pain. As a corollary, the presence of lumbar disc disease, even frank rupture, bears an inconsistent relationship to low back pain, as already emphasized.

In cases of root compression, pain is also characteristically provoked by pressure along the course of the sciatic nerve at the classic points of Valleix (sciatic notch, retrotrochanteric gutter, posterior surface of thigh, and head of fibula). Pressure at one point may cause radiation of pain and tingling down the leg.

Examination discloses varying degrees of motor, sensory, and reflex loss. As the symptoms suggest, the signs are symmetrical, and more severe in distal than in proximal portions of the limbs, and often confined to the legs. In some cases, the disproportionate affection of motor power may be striking, taking the form of a footand wrist-drop, but the proximal muscles are usually affected as well (indicated, for example, by climbing stairs or by difficulty in arising from a squatting position). In a few patients, the weakness appears to be most severe in the proximal muscles. Absolute paralysis of the legs had been observed in the past only rarely; immobility caused by contractures at the knees and ankles in neglected patients was a more common occurrence. Tenderness of muscles on deep pressure is a highly characteristic finding, elicited most readily in the muscles of the feet and calves. In the arms, tendon reflexes are sometimes retained despite a loss of strength in the hands. In patients in whom pain and dysesthesias are prominent and motor loss is slight, the reflexes at knee and ankle may be retained or even of greater than average briskness. This attests to the predominant affection of the small nerve fibers.

Excessive sweating of the soles and dorsal aspects of the feet and of the volar surfaces of the hands and fingers is a common manifestation of alcohol-induced nutritional neuropathy. Postural hypotension is also sometimes associated, indicative of involvement of the peripheral sympathetic nerve fibers.

Sensory loss or impairment may involve all the modalities, although one may be affected out of proportion to the others, usually pain and temperature. One cannot predict from the patient’s symptoms which mode of sensation might be affected disproportionately. In patients with impairment of superficial sensation (i.e., touch, pain, and temperature), the border between impaired and normal sensation is not sharp but shades off gradually over a considerable vertical extent of the limbs.

A 68-year-old man presents with a complaint of light-headedness on standing that is worse after meals and in hot environments. Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson’s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the α1 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension. Physical examination is otherwise unre-markable with no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or parkinsonian features. Laboratory examinations are negative except for plasma norepinephrine, which is low at 98 pg/mL (normal for his age 250–400 pg/mL). A diagnosis of pure autonomic failure is made, based on the clinical picture and the absence of drugs that could induce orthostatic hypoten-sion and diseases commonly associated with autonomic neuropathy (eg, diabetes, Parkinson’s disease). What precau-tions should this patient observe in using sympathomimetic drugs? Can such drugs be used in his treatment?

The sympathetic nervous system is an important regulator of virtually all organ systems. This is particularly evident in the regulation of blood pressure. As illustrated in the case study, the autonomic nervous system is crucial for the maintenance of blood pressure even under relatively minor situations of stress (eg, the gravitational stress of standing).

The American Diabetes Association criteria for acceptable control include an HbA1c of less than 7% (53 mmol/mol) and pre-meal glucose levels of 90–130 mg/dL (5–7.2 mmol/L) and less than 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L) one hour and 150 mg/dL (8.3 mmol/L) two hours after meals. While the HbA1c target is appropriate for individuals treated with lifestyle interventions and euglycemic therapy, it may need to be modified for individuals treated with insulin or insulin secretagogues due to their increased risk of hypoglycemia. Less stringent blood glucose control also is appropriate for children as well as patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, and significant microvascular and macrovascular disease. For the elderly frail patient an HbA1c greater than 8% may be appropriate.

Treatment must be individualized on the basis of the type of diabetes and specific needs of each patient.

A. Type 1 Diabetes

For most type 1 patients, at least 3 or 4 insulin injections a day are necessary for safe and effective control of glucose levels. A combination of rapidly acting insulin analogs and long-acting insulin analogs allow for more physiologic insulin replacement. Generally, for an adult with type 1 diabetes, the total daily insulin requirement in units is equal to the weight in pounds divided by four, or 0.55 times the person’s weight in kilograms. Approximately 40% of the total daily insulin dosage covers the background or basal insulin requirements, and the remainder covers meal and snack requirement and high blood sugar corrections. This is an approximate calculation and should be individualized. Examples of

Patients with a bileaﬂet aortic valve with no risk factors (atrial fibrillation, previous thromboembolism, left ventricular dysfunction, a hypercoagulable state, older generation thrombogenic valve) generally do not require anticoagulation bridging. Warfarin should be stopped 72 hours prior to the procedure and resumed 24 hours after the procedure. In contrast, patients with a mechanical aortic valve and any above mentioned risk factor, or a mechanical mitral valve, should be bridged with intravenous unfractionated heparin when the INR falls below 2. The heparin drip should be stopped approximately 6 to 8 hours before the procedure and restarted as soon as possible after surgery when the patient is deemed stable from postoperative bleeding risk. The heparin bridge can be stopped when the INR reaches therapeutic levels (207).

In the postoperative period, patients with mitral stenosis should be carefully monitored for pulmonary edema because they may not be able to compensate for the amount of intravenous ﬂuid administered during surgery. Prevention of tachycardia is important, as it may lead to pulmonary edema. Patients with mitral stenosis frequently have pulmonary hypertension and decreased airway compliance. They may require more pulmonary support and therapy postoperatively, including prolonged mechanical ventilation.

the cause of the hypotension is pursued. Shock in a trauma patient or postoperative patient should be presumed to be due to hemorrhage until proven otherwise. The clinical signs of shock may be evidenced by agitation, cool clammy extremities, tachy-cardia, weak or absent peripheral pulses, and hypotension. Such apparent clinical shock results from at least 25% to 30% loss of the blood volume. However, substantial volumes of blood may be lost before the classic clinical manifestations of shock are evident.

Pulmonary Function Testing (See also Chap. 307) The initial pulmonary function test obtained is spirometry. This study is an effort-dependent test used to assess for obstructive pathophysiology as seen in asthma, COPD, and bronchiectasis. A diminished-forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) (often defined as <70% of the predicted value) is diagnostic of obstruction. In addition to measuring FEV1 and FVC, the clinician should examine the flow-volume loop (which is effort-independent). A plateau of the inspiratory and expiratory curves suggests large-airway obstruction in extrathoracic and intrathoracic locations, respectively.

Spirometry with symmetric decreases in FEV1 and FVC warrants further testing, including measurement of lung volumes and the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). A total lung capacity <80% of the predicted value for a patient’s age, race, sex, and height defines restrictive pathophysiology. Restriction can result from parenchymal disease, neuromuscular weakness, or chest wall or pleural diseases. Restriction with impaired gas exchange, as indicated by a decreased DLCO, suggests parenchymal lung disease. Additional testing, such as measurements of maximal expiratory pressure and maximal inspiratory pressure, can help diagnose neuromuscular weakness. Normal spirometry, normal lung volumes, and a low DLCO should prompt further evaluation for pulmonary vascular disease.

Arterial blood gas testing is often helpful in assessing respiratory 1663 disease. Hypoxemia, while usually apparent with pulse oximetry, can be further evaluated with the measurement of arterial PO2 and the calculation of an alveolar gas and arterial blood oxygen tension difference ([A–a]DO2). Patients with diseases that cause ventilation-perfusion mismatch or shunt physiology have an increased (A–a) DO2 at rest. Arterial blood gas testing also allows the measurement of arterial PCO2. Hypercarbia can accompany severe airway obstruction (e.g., COPD) or progressive restrictive physiology, as in patients with neuromuscular weakness.

The respiratory system can be divided into two components: the lungs and the chest wall. Normally, respiratory system compliance is ~100 mL/cmH2O. Pathophysiologic processes such as pleural effusions, pneumothorax, and increased abdominal girth all reduce chest wall compliance. Lung compliance may be reduced by pneumonia, pulmonary edema, interstitial lung disease, or auto-PEEP. Accordingly, patients with abnormalities in compliance of the respiratory system (lungs and/or chest wall) typically have elevated peak and plateau airway pressures but a normal gradient between these two pressures. Auto-PEEP occurs when there is insufficient time for emptying of alveoli before the next inspiratory cycle. Since the alveoli have not decompressed completely, alveolar pressure remains positive at the end of exhalation (functional residual capacity). This phenomenon results most commonly from critical narrowing of distal airways in disease processes such as asthma and COPD. Auto-PEEP with resulting alveolar overdistention may result in diminished lung compliance, reflected by abnormally increased plateau airway pressures. Modern mechanical ventilators allow breath-to-breath display of pressure and flow, permitting detection of problems such as patient-ventilator dyssynchrony, airflow obstruction, and auto-PEEP (Fig. 321–6).

Oxygen delivery (QO2) is a function of cardiac output and the content of O2 in the arterial blood (CaO2). The CaO2 is determined by the hemoglobin concentration, the arterial hemoglobin saturation, and dissolved O2 not bound to hemoglobin. For normal adults:

QO2 = 50 dL/min × (1.39 × 15 g/dL [hemoglobin concentration] × 1.0 [hemoglobin % saturation] + 0.0031 × 100 [PaO2]) = 50 dL/min (cardiac output) × 21.6 mL O2 per dL blood (CaO2)

MUCUS HYPERSECRETION Increased mucus secretion contributes to the viscid mucous plugs that occlude asthmatic airways, particularly in fatal asthma. There is hyperplasia of submucosal glands that are confined to large airways and of increased numbers of epithelial goblet cells. IL-13 induces mucus hypersecretion in experimental models of asthma.

NEURAL REGULATION Various defects in autonomic neural control may contribute to AHR in asthma, but these are likely to be secondary to the disease, rather than primary defects. Cholinergic pathways, through the release of acetylcholine acting on muscarinic receptors, cause bronchoconstriction and may be activated reflexly in asthma.

predominant nonproductive cough (cough-variant asthma). There 1675 may be no abnormal physical findings when asthma is under control.

The diagnosis of asthma is usually apparent from the symptoms of variable and intermittent airways obstruction, but must be confirmed by objective measurements of lung function.

Lung Function Tests Simple spirometry confirms airflow limitation with a reduced FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, and PEF (Fig. 309-6). Reversibility is demonstrated by a >12% and 200-mL increase in FEV1 15 min after an inhaled short-acting β2-agonist or in some patients by a 2to 4-week trial of oral corticosteroids (OCS) (prednisone or prednisolone 30–40 mg daily). Measurements of PEF twice daily may confirm the diurnal variations in airflow obstruction. Flow-volume loops show reduced peak flow and reduced maximum expiratory flow. Further lung function tests are rarely necessary, but whole-body plethysmography shows increased airway resistance and may show increased total lung capacity and residual volume. Gas diffusion is usually normal, but there may be a small increase in gas transfer in some patients.

capacity of greater than 1.5 L. If a downward trend in these measurements is recognized and the vital capacity diminishes to below about 10 mL/kg, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are usually necessary (see further on). However, a fairly severe impairment of ventilation may occur before the first sign of dyspnea appears and before there is elevation of arterial carbon dioxide content. Incipient respiratory failure may be evident by tachypnea and a decrease in arterial oxygen tension (Po2 less than 85 mm Hg) reflecting pulmonary atelectasis. When respiratory failure arises gradually as the patient weakens

document (4) 

Measurement of maximal inspiratory force and expiratory vital capacity usually suffices for the bedside estimation of diaphragmatic strength and respiratory function. The trend of these measurements is a guide to the likelihood of respiratory failure. As had been observed in poliomyelitis, the strength of the neck muscles and trapezii, which share the same segmental innervation as the diaphragm, tends to parallel diaphragmatic power. A rough estimate of breathing capacity may be obtained by having the patient count quickly on one deep breath. The ability to reach 20 generally corresponds to a vital capacity of greater than

as the patient weakens over days, there is slight tachycardia, diaphoresis, restlessness, and tachypnea. Attempts to forestall intubation and positive-pressure ventilation by using negative-pressure cuirass-type devices have been unsatisfactory in our experience. Patients with oropharyngeal weakness require intubation even earlier so as to prevent aspiration, but full mechanical ventilation is not always necessary at the same time. Patients in these circumstances should obviously be admitted to an intensive care unit staffed by personnel skilled in maintaining ventilation and airway patency.

At each return visit, the well-being of mother and fetus are assessed (see Table 9-1). Fetal heart rate, growth, and activity and amnionic fluid volume are evaluated. Maternal blood pressure and weight and their extent of change are examined. Symptoms such as headache, altered vision, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, bleeding, vaginal luid leakage, and dysuria are sought. Mter 20 weeks' gestation, uterine examination measures size from the symphysis to the fundus. In late pregnancy, vaginal examination often provides valuable information that includes conirmation of the presenting part and its station, clinical estimation of pelvic capacity and configuration, amnionic luid volume adequacy, and cervical consistency, efacement, and dilatation (Chap. 22, p. 435).

Between 20 and 34 weeks' gestation, the height of the uterine fundus measured in centimeters correlates closely with gestational age in weeks Gimenez, 1983). his measurement is used to monitor fetal growth and amnionic fluid volume. It is measured along the abdominal wall from the top of the symphysis pubis to the top of the fundus. Importantly, the bladder must be emptied before fundal measurement (Worthen, 1980). Obesity or the presence of uterine masses such as leiomyomas may also limit fundal height accuracy. Moreover, using fundal height alone, fetal-growth restriction may be undiagnosed in up to a third of cases (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2015b; Haragan, 2015).

Instruments incorporating Doppler ultrasound are often used to easily detect fetal heart action, and in the absence of maternal obesity, heart sounds are almost always detectable by 10 weeks with such instruments (Chap. 10, p. 213). he fetal heart rate ranges from 11e0 to 160 beats per minute and is typically heard as a double sound. Using a standard nonampliied stethoscope, the fetal heart is audible by 20 weeks in 80 percent of women, and by 22 weeks, heart sounds are expected to be heard in all (Herbert, 1987). Because the fetus moves freely in amni onic fluid, the site on the maternal abdomen where fetal heart sounds can be heard best will vary.

Until recently, clinicians customarily calculated menstrual age with term pregnancy averaging approximately 280 days, or 40 weeks between the first day of the LMP and birth. This corresponds to 9 and 113 calendar months. However, menstrual cycle length variability among women renders many of these calculations inaccurate. This realization, combined with the frequent use of first-trimester sonography, has led to more accurate gestational age determination (Duryea, 2015). Much of this change hinges on the accuracy of early sonographic measurement. As a result, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (Reddy, 2014) together recommend the following: 1.

First-trimester sonography is the most accurate method to establish or reairm gestational age.

development, the testes descend from the intra-abdominal space into the scrotum in the third trimester. Their descent is guided by the gubernaculum through an evagination of the peritoneum, which protrudes through the inguinal canal and becomes the processus vaginalis. Between 36 and 40 weeks’ gestation, the processus vaginalis closes and eliminates the peritoneal open-ing at the internal inguinal ring.14 Failure of the peritoneum to close results in a patent processus vaginalis (PPV). In preterm babies, indirect inguinal hernias as a result of PPV is very high (Fig. 37-10). However,

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT:

The evaluation of the patient with anemia requires a careful history and physical examination. Nutritional history related to drugs or alcohol intake and family history of anemia should always be assessed. Certain geographic backgrounds and ethnic origins are associated with an increased likelihood of an inherited disorder of the hemoglobin molecule or intermediary metabolism. Glucose-6phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and certain hemoglobinopathies are seen more commonly in those of Middle Eastern or African origin, including African Americans who have a high frequency of G6PD deficiency. Other information that may be useful includes exposure to certain toxic agents or drugs and symptoms related to other disorders commonly associated with anemia. These include symptoms and signs such as bleeding, fatigue, malaise, fever, weight loss, night sweats, and other systemic symptoms. Clues to the mechanisms of anemia may be provided on physical examination by findings of infection, blood in the stool, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, or petechiae. Splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy suggest an underlying lymphoproliferative disease, whereas petechiae suggest platelet dysfunction. Past laboratory measurements are helpful to determine a time of onset.

In the anemic patient, physical examination may demonstrate a forceful heartbeat, strong peripheral pulses, and a systolic “flow” murmur. The skin and mucous membranes may be pale if the hemoglobin is <80–100 g/L (8–10 g/dL). This part of the physical examination should focus on areas where vessels are close to the surface such as the mucous membranes, nail beds, and palmar creases. If the palmar creases are lighter in color than the surrounding skin when the hand is hyperextended, the hemoglobin level is usually <80 g/L (8 g/dL).

Serum ferritin, ˜g/L

Certain clinical conditions carry an increased likelihood of iron deficiency. Pregnancy, adolescence, periods of rapid growth, and an intermittent history of blood loss of any kind should alert the clini-0 cian to possible iron deficiency. A cardinal rule is that the appearance of iron deficiency in an adult male means gastrointestinal blood loss until proven otherwise. Signs related to iron deficiency depend on the severity and chronicity of the anemia in addition to the usual signs of anemia—fatigue, pallor, and reduced exercise capacity. Cheilosis (fissures at the corners of the mouth) and koilonychia (spooning of the fingernails) are signs of advanced tissue iron deficiency. The diagnosis of iron deficiency is typically based on laboratory results.

Abnormalities in fluid volume and electrolyte composition are common and important clinical disorders. Drugs that block specific transport functions of the renal tubules are valuable clinical tools in the treatment of these disorders. Although various agents that increase urine volume (diuretics) have been described since antiquity, it was not until 1937 that carbonic anhydrase inhibitors were first described and not until 1957 that a much more useful and powerful diuretic agent (chlorothiazide) became available.

asthma and allergy. Exacerbating factors include viral infections, exposure to allergens and irritants (e.g., smoke, strong odors, fumes), exercise, emotions, and change in weather/humidity. Nighttime symptoms are common. Rhinosinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (especially aspirin) can aggravate asthma. Treatment of these conditions may lessen the frequency and severity of the asthma.

During acute episodes, tachypnea, tachycardia, cough, wheezing, and a prolonged expiratory phase may be present. Physical findings may be subtle. Classic wheezing may not be prominent if there is poor air movement from airway obstruction. As the attack progresses, cyanosis, diminished air movement, retractions, agitation, inability to speak, tripod sitting position, diaphoresis, and pulsus paradoxus (decrease in blood pressure of >15 mm Hg with inspiration) may be observed. Physical examination may show evidence of other atopic diseases such as eczema or allergic rhinitis.

Objective measurements of pulmonary function (spirometry) help establish the diagnosis and direct the treatment of asthma. Spirometry is used to monitor response to treatment, assess degree of reversibility with therapeutic intervention, and measure the severity of an asthma exacerbation. Children older than 5 years of age can perform spirometry maneuvers. Variability in predicted peak flow reference values make spirometry preferred to peak flow measures in the diagnosis of asthma. For younger children who cannot perform spirometry maneuvers or peak flow, a therapeutic trial of controller medications helps in the diagnosis of asthma.

A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 36-hour history of lower abdominal pain that was sharp and initially intermittent, later becoming constant and severe. The patient also reported feeling nauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have diarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours before admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative.

On physical examination there was tenderness in the right iliac fossa with guarding. On vaginal examination a tender mass in the right adnexal region was felt. The patient subsequently underwent a transvaginal ultrasound examination for evaluation of adnexal pathology. The scan showed a markedly enlarged right ovary measuring up to 8 cm in long axis with echogenic stroma and peripherally distributed follicles. There was no internal vascularity when color Doppler was applied. A small amount of free fluid was seen in the pouch of Douglas. The diagnosis of ovarian torsion was made.

Ovarian torsion is the twisting of an ovary on its suspensory ligament, which contains arterial, venous, and lymphatic vessels (forming so-called vascular pedicle), leading to a compromised blood supply. Initially, the venous and lymphatic circulation is compromised, resulting in ovarian edema and enlargement. The arterial flow is maintained longer due to thicker and less compressible arterial walls. Prolonged torsion leads to increased internal ovarian pressure that eventually results in arterial thrombosis, ischemia of the ovarian tissue, and necrosis. If the correct diagnosis and treatment are delayed, the patient may develop generalized sepsis.

The symptoms are nonspecific, making the diagnosis of ovarian torsion challenging. There is often no significant past medical history.

A 52-year-old woman visited her family physician with complaints of increasing lethargy and vomiting. The physician examined her and noted that compared to previous visits she had lost significant weight. She was also jaundiced, and on examination of the abdomen a well-defined 10-cm rounded mass was palpable below the liver edge in the right upper quadrant (Fig. 4.185).

The clinical diagnosis was carcinoma of the head of the pancreas.

It is difficult to appreciate how such a precise diagnosis can be made clinically when only three clinical signs have been described.

The patient’s obstruction was in the distal bile duct.

When a patient has jaundice, the causes are excessive breakdown of red blood cells (prehepatic), hepatic failure (hepatic jaundice), and posthepatic causes, which include obstruction along the length of the biliary tree.

The patient had a mass in her right upper quadrant that was palpable below the liver; this was the gallbladder.

In healthy individuals, the gallbladder is not palpable. An expanded gallbladder indicates obstruction either within the cystic duct or below the level of the cystic duct insertion (i.e., the bile duct).

The patient’s vomiting was related to the position of the tumor.

It is not uncommon for vomiting and weight loss (cachexia) to occur in patients with a malignant disease. The head of the pancreas lies within the curve of the duodenum, primarily adjacent to the descending part of the duodenum. Any tumor mass in the region of the head of the pancreas is likely to expand and may encase and invade the duodenum. Unfortunately, in this patient’s case, this happened, producing almost complete obstruction. Further discussion with the patient revealed that she was vomiting relatively undigested food soon after each meal.

A CT scan demonstrated further complications.

Principal health concerns of menopausal women include vasomotor symptoms, urogenital atrophy, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, cancer, cognitive decline, and sexual problems. Options for caring for menopausal women have increased greatly since hormone therapy was first introduced in the 1960s. With respect to hormone use, there are many choices of hormone type, dose, and method of administration. In addition to hormones, estrogen agonistantagonists, centrally acting agents, and bisphosphonates are available to treat menopausal health concerns. Women are requesting more information on complementary and alternative therapies, which are being studied more carefully. The many options now available make caring for the postmenopausal woman more challenging and more rewarding.

Vasomotor symptoms affect up to 75% of perimenopausal women. Symptoms last for 1 to 2 years after menopause in most women, but may continue for up to 10 years or longer in others. Hot ﬂashes are the primary reason women seek care at menopause. Hot ﬂashes disturb women at work, interrupt daily activities and disrupt sleep (5). Many women report difficulty concentrating and emotional lability during the menopausal transition. Treatment of vasomotor symptoms should improve these cognitive and mood symptoms if they are secondary to sleep disruption and its resulting daytime fatigue. The incidence of thyroid disease increases as women age; therefore, thyroid function tests should be performed if vasomotor symptoms are atypical or resistant to therapy.

IBS is a disorder that affects all ages, although most patients have their first symptoms before age 45. Older individuals have a lower reporting frequency. Women are diagnosed with IBS two to three times as often as men and make up 80% of the population with severe IBS. As indicated in Table 352-1, pain or abdominal discomfort is a key symptom for the diagnosis of IBS. These symptoms should be improved with defecation and/or have their onset associated with a change in frequency or form of stool. Painless diarrhea or constipation does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria to be classified as IBS. Supportive symptoms that are not part of the diagnostic criteria include defecation straining, urgency or a feeling of incomplete bowel movement, passing mucus, and bloating.

Abdominal Pain According to the current IBS diagnostic criteria, abdominal pain or discomfort is a prerequisite clinical feature of IBS. Abdominal pain in IBS is highly variable in intensity and location. It is frequently episodic and crampy, but it may be superimposed on a background of constant ache. Pain may be mild enough to be ignored or it may interfere with daily activities. Despite this, malnutrition due to inadequate caloric intake is exceedingly rare with IBS. Sleep deprivation is also unusual because abdominal pain is almost uniformly present only during waking hours. However, patients with severe IBS frequently wake repeatedly during the night; thus, nocturnal pain is a poor discriminating factor between organic and functional bowel disease. Pain is often exacerbated by eating or emotional stress and improved by passage of flatus or stools. In addition, female patients with IBS commonly report worsening symptoms during the premenstrual and menstrual phases.

(valine for glutamic acid at the β6 position), sickle hemoglobin crystallizes and forms a gel in the deoxygenated state. When reoxygenated, the sickle hemoglobin is normally soluble. The so-called reversible sickle cell is capable of entering the microcirculation. As the oxygen is extracted and saturation declines, sickling may occur, occluding the microvasculature. The surrounding tissue undergoes infarction, inducing pain and dysfunction. This sickling phenomenon is exacerbated by hypoxia, acidosis, fever, hypothermia, and dehydration.

Clinical Manifestations and Treatment. A child with sickle cell anemia is vulnerable to life-threatening infection by 4 months of age. By that time, splenic dysfunction is caused by sickling of the RBCs within the spleen, resulting in an inability to filter microorganisms from the bloodstream in most patients. Splenic dysfunction is followed, eventually, by splenic infarction, usually by 2 to 4 years of age. The loss of normal splenic function makes the patient susceptible to overwhelming infection by encapsulated organisms, especially Streptococcus pneumoniae and other pathogens (Table 150-8).The hallmark of infection is fever. A febrile patient with a sickle cell syndrome (temperature >38.5°C) must be evaluated immediately (see Chapter 96). Current precautions to prevent infections include prophylactic daily oral penicillin begun at diagnosis and vaccinations against pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis B virus, and influenza virus.

The anemia of hemoglobin SS disease is usually a chronic, moderately severe, hemolytic anemia that is not routinely transfusion dependent. The severity depends in part on the patient’s phenotype. Manifestations of chronic anemia include jaundice, pallor, variable splenomegaly in infancy, a cardiac flow murmur, and delayed growth and sexual maturation. Decisions about transfusion should be made on the basis of the patient’s clinical condition, the hemoglobin level, and the reticulocyte count.

Bleeding from right colonic vascular ectasias in the elderly may be overt or occult; it tends to be chronic and only occasionally is hemodynamically significant. Endoscopic hemostatic therapy may be useful in the treatment of vascular ectasias, as well as discrete bleeding ulcers and postpolypectomy bleeding. Surgical therapy is generally required for major, persistent, or recurrent bleeding from the wide variety of colonic sources of GIB that cannot be treated medically, angiographically, or endoscopically.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT:

Measurement of the heart rate and blood pressure is the best way to initially assess a patient with GIB. Clinically significant bleeding leads to postural changes in heart rate or blood pressure, tachycardia, and, finally, recumbent hypotension. In contrast, the hemoglobin does not fall immediately with acute GIB, due to proportionate reductions in plasma and red cell volumes (i.e., “people bleed whole blood”). Thus, hemoglobin may be normal or only minimally decreased at the initial presentation of a severe bleeding episode. As extravascular fluid enters the vascular space to restore volume, the hemoglobin falls, but this process may take up to 72 h. Transfusion is recommended when the hemoglobin drops below 7 g/dL, based on a large randomized trial showing this restrictive transfusion strategy decreases rebleeding and death in acute UGIB compared with a transfusion threshold of 9 g/dL. Patients with slow, chronic GIB may have very low hemoglobin values despite normal blood pressure and heart rate. With the development of iron-deficiency anemia, the mean corpuscular volume will be low and red blood cell distribution width will increase.

Megakaryocytes are giant, multinucleated cells derivedfrom the primitive stem cell and are polyploid (16 to 32 timesthe normal DNA content) because of nuclear but not cytoplasmic cell division. Platelets form by invagination of themegakaryocytic cell membrane and bud off from the periphery. Thrombopoietin is the primary regulator of plateletproduction. Platelets adhere to damaged endothelium andsubendothelial surfaces via specific receptors for the adhesive proteins, von Willebrand factor (vWF), and fibrinogen.Platelets also have specific granules that readily release theircontents after stimulation and trigger the process of plateletaggregation. Platelets circulate for 7 to 10 days and have nonucleus.

Lymphocytes are particularly abundant in the bone marrow of young children. These are primarily B lymphocytes arising in the spleen and lymph nodes, but T lymphocytes also are present.

The diagnosis of anemia is determined by comparison of thepatient’s hemoglobin level with age-specific and sex-specific normal values (see Table 149-2). The production ofandrogens at the onset of puberty in boys causes males tomaintain a normal hemoglobin value about 1.5 to 2 g/dLhigher than girls. The easiest quantitative definition of anemia is any hemoglobin or hematocrit value that is 2 standard deviations (SDs) (95% confidence limits) below themean for age and gender. However, in certain pathologicstates, anemia may be present with a normal hemoglobinlevel (e.g., cyanotic cardiac or pulmonary disease or abnormally high hemoglobin affinity for oxygen). This is a physiologic definition of anemia. Anemia is often a manifestationof some other primary process and may accentuate otherorgan dysfunction.

The physical examination of patients with blood disordersfirst focuses on hemodynamic stability. Acute episodes ofanemia may be life-threatening, presenting with impairment of perfusion and cognitive status. The two mostcommon findings of anemia include pallor and jaundice. The presence of petechiae, purpura, or deeper sites of bleeding, including generalized hemorrhage, indicatesabnormalities of platelets, coagulation factors, or both.Growth parameters point to whether anemia is an acuteor chronic process. Severe types of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia often are associated with congenital anomalies and a pattern of growth delay. Organsystem involvement (especially hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy) or systemic illness point to a generalized illness as the cause for hematologic abnormalities(Table 149-1).

Diagnosis of pediatric blood disorders requires a detailed knowledge of normal hematologic values and varies according to ageand, after puberty, according to sex (Table 149-2). Directed bythe history, physical examination, and screening laboratorystudies, specific diagnostic testing can confirm the diagnosis.

Diagnosis of Vitamin D Deficiency, Rickets, and Osteomalacia The most specific screening test for vitamin D deficiency in otherwise healthy individuals is a serum 25(OH)D level. Although the normal ranges vary, levels of 25(OH)D <37 nmol/L (<15 ng/mL) are associated with increasing PTH levels and lower bone density. The Institute of Medicine has defined vitamin D sufficiency as a vitamin D level >50 nmol/L (>20 ng/mL), although higher levels may be required to 2466 optimize intestinal calcium absorption in the elderly and those with underlying disease states.

Glucose tolerance is classified into three broad categories: normal glucose homeostasis, DM, or impaired glucose homeostasis. Glucose tolerance can be assessed using the fasting plasma glucose (FPG), the response to oral glucose challenge, or the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). An FPG <5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL), a plasma glucose <140 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) following an oral glucose challenge, and an HbA1c <5.7% are considered to define normal glucose tolerance. The International Expert Committee with members appointed by the ADA, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, and the International Diabetes Federation have issued diagnostic criteria for DM (Table 417-2) based on the following premises: (1) the FPG, the response to an oral glucose challenge (oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT]), and HbA1c differ among individuals, and (2) DM is defined as the level of glycemia at which diabetes-specific complications occur rather than on deviations from a population-based mean. For example, the prevalence of retinopathy in Native Americans (Pima Indian population) begins to increase at an FPG >6.4 mmol/L (116 mg/dL) (Fig. 417-3).

An FPG ≥7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL), a glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) 2 h after an oral glucose challenge, or an HbA1c ≥6.5% warrants the diagnosis of DM (Table 417-2). A random plasma glucose

B. Diabetic Coma 1. Diabetic ketoacidosis—Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening medical emergency caused by inadequate or absent insulin replacement, which occurs in people with type 1 diabetes and infrequently in those with type 2 diabetes. It typically occurs in newly diagnosed type 1 patients or in those who have experienced interrupted insulin replacement, and rarely in people with type 2 diabetes who have concurrent unusually stressful conditions such as sepsis or pancreatitis or are on high-dose steroid therapy. DKA occurs more frequently in patients on insulin pumps. Poor compliance—either for psychological reasons or because of inadequate education—is one of the most common causes of DKA, particularly when episodes are recurrent.

Signs and symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, deep slow (Kussmaul) breathing, change in mental status (including coma), elevated blood and urinary ketones and glucose, an arterial blood pH lower than 7.3, and low bicarbonate (15 mmol/L).

The fundamental treatment for DKA includes aggressive intravenous hydration and insulin therapy and maintenance of potassium and other electrolyte levels. Fluid and insulin therapy is based on the patient’s individual needs and requires frequent reevaluation and modification. Close attention must be given to hydration and renal status, sodium and potassium levels, and the rate of correction of plasma glucose and plasma osmolality. Fluid therapy generally begins with normal saline. Regular human insulin should be used for intravenous therapy with a usual starting dosage of about 0.1 U/kg/h.

Physical Findings Splenomegaly is the most common physical finding, occurring in 20–70% of patients depending on health care screening frequency. Other less common findings include hepatomegaly (10–20%), lymphadenopathy (5–10%), and extramedullary disease (skin or subcutaneous lesions). The latter indicates CML transformation if a biopsy confirms the presence of sheets of blasts. Other physical findings are manifestations of complications of high tumor burden described earlier (e.g., cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, bleeding). High basophil counts may be associated with histamine overproduction causing pruritus, diarrhea, flushing, and even gastrointestinal ulcers.

Hematologic and Marrow Findings In untreated CML, leukocytosis ranging from 10–500 × 109/L is common. The peripheral blood differential shows left-shifted hematopoiesis with predominance of neutrophils and the presence of bands, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, promyelocytes, and blasts (usually ≤5%). Basophils and/or eosinophils are frequently increased. Thrombocytosis is common, but thrombocytopenia is rare and, when present, suggests a worse prognosis, disease acceleration, or an unrelated etiology. Anemia is present in one-third of patients. Cyclic oscillations of counts are noted in 25% of patients without treatment. Biochemical abnormalities include a low leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score and high levels of vitamin B12, uric acid, lactic dehydrogenase, and lysozyme. The presence of unexplained and sustained leukocytosis, with or without splenomegaly, should lead to a marrow examination and cytogenetic analysis.

Pulmonary involvement is frequently prominent; 35% of patients have a hacking, nonproductive cough, and 23% of patients who undergo chest radiography have pulmonary densities due to interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and pleural effusions. Bibasilar rales are the most common pulmonary sign. Less common clinical manifestations include abdominal pain, confusion, stupor, seizures, ataxia, coma, and jaundice. Clinical laboratory studies frequently reveal anemia and leukopenia early in the course, leukocytosis late in the course, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, hypoalbuminemia, mildly increased serum hepatic aminotransferases, and prerenal azotemia. Complications can include respiratory failure, hematemesis, cerebral hemorrhage, and hemolysis. Severe illness necessitates the admission of 10% of hospitalized patients to an intensive care unit. Greater severity is generally associated with old age, underlying disease, and treatment with a sulfonamide; the case-fatality rate is 1%. In a study of children with murine typhus, 50% suffered only nocturnal fevers, feeling well enough for active daytime play.

Diagnosis and Treatment Serologic studies of acuteand convalescent-phase sera can provide a diagnosis, and an immunohistochemical method for identification of typhus group-specific antigens in biopsy samples has been developed. Cultivation and PCR are used only infrequently and are not widely available. Nevertheless, most patients are treated empirically with doxycycline (100 mg bid orally for 7–15 days) on the basis of clinical suspicion. Ciprofloxacin provides an alternative if doxycycline is contraindicated.

Anteroposterior and frog-leg radiographs of the hip are usually normal. Ultrasonography may reveal a joint effusion. It is mandatory to rule out septic arthritis in the presence of effusion with a joint aspiration and cell count.

The mainstay of treatment is bed rest and minimal weight bearing until the pain resolves. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication is usually sufficient to decrease pain. Limiting strenuous activity and exercise for 1 to 2 weeks following recovery is helpful. Follow-up will help ensure that there is no deterioration. Lack of improvement necessitates further evaluation for more serious disorders.

Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCPD) is idiopathic avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis) of the capital epiphysis of the femoral head. The etiology is unclear, but it is likely caused by an interruption of the blood supply to the capital femoral epiphysis. There may be an associated hypercoagulability state (factor V Leiden).

LCPD commonly presents in patients 3 to 12 years of age, with a mean age of 7 years. It is four to five times more common in boys.

Patients may not present for several weeks because of minimaldiscomfort; the classic presentation is a child with an atraumatic, painless limp. There may be mild or intermittent hip/groin, anterior thigh, or knee pain. Decreased internal rotationand abduction with some discomfort, thigh muscle spasm, andanterior thigh muscular atrophy may be present. Patients havedelayed bone age.

P. aeruginosa, or (rarely) S. pneumoniae. Aspiration pneumonia is typically a polymicrobial infection involving both aerobes and anaerobes. A significant pleural effusion should be tapped for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. If the fluid has a pH of <7, a glucose level of <2. 2 mmol/L, and a lactate dehydrogenase concentration of >1000 U/L or if bacteria are seen or cultured, then it should be completely drained; a chest tube is often required and video-assisted thoracoscopy may be needed for late treatment or difficult cases.

Follow-Up Fever and leukocytosis usually resolve within 2–4 days in otherwise healthy patients with CAP, but physical findings may persist longer. Chest radiographic abnormalities are slowest to resolve (4–12 weeks), with the speed of clearance depending on the patient’s age and underlying lung disease. Patients may be discharged from the hospital once their clinical conditions, including comorbidities, are stable. The site of residence after discharge (nursing home, home with family, home alone) is an important discharge timing consideration, particularly for elderly patients. For a hospitalized patient, a follow-up radiograph ∼4–6 weeks later is recommended. If relapse or recurrence is documented, particularly in the same lung segment, the possibility of an underlying neoplasm must be considered.

The prognosis of CAP depends on the patient’s age, comorbidities, and site of treatment (inpatient or outpatient). Young patients without comorbidity do well and usually recover fully after ~2 weeks. Older patients and those with comorbid conditions can take several weeks longer to recover fully. The overall mortality rate for the outpatient group is <1%. For patients requiring hospitalization, the overall mortality rate is estimated at 10%, with ~50% of deaths directly attributable to pneumonia.

The main preventive measure is vaccination (Chap. 148). Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices should be followed for influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.

MRI has significantly advanced the ability to image musculoskeletal structures. MRI has the advantages of providing multiplanar images with fine anatomic detail and contrast resolution (Fig. 393-8) that allows for the superior ability to visualize bone marrow and soft tissue periarticular structures. Although more costly with a longer proceduraltimethanCT,theMRIhasbecomethepreferredtechniquewhen evaluating complex musculoskeletal disorders.

MRI can image fascia, vessels, nerve, muscle, cartilage, ligaments, tendons, pannus, synovial effusions, and bone marrow. Visualization of particular structures can be enhanced by altering the pulse sequence to produce either T1-or T2-weighted spin echo, gradient echo, or inversion recovery (including short tau inversion recovery [STIR]) images. Because of its sensitivity to changes in marrow fat, MRI is a sensitivebutnonspecificmeansofdetectingosteonecrosis,osteomyelitis, and marrow inflammation indicating overlying synovitis or osteitis (Fig. 393-8). Because of its enhanced soft tissue resolution, MRI is more sensitive than arthrography or CT in the diagnosis of soft tissue injuries (e.g., meniscal and rotator cuff tears); intraarticular derangements; marrow abnormalities (osteonecrosis, myeloma); and spinal cord or nerve root damage, synovitis, or cartilage damage or loss.

In knees, buckling may occur, in part, due to weakness of muscles crossing the joint. Mechanical symptoms, such as buckling, catching, or locking, could also signify internal derangement, such as meniscal tears, and need to be evaluated. In the knee, pain with activities requiring knee flexion, such as stair climbing and arising from a chair, often emanates from the patellofemoral compartment of the knee, which does not actively articulate until the knee is bent ~35°.

OA is the most common cause of chronic knee pain in persons over age 45, but the differential diagnosis is long. Inflammatory arthritis is likely if there is prolonged morning stiffness and many other joints are affected. Bursitis occurs commonly around knees and hips. A physical examination should focus on whether tenderness is over the joint line (at the junction of the two bones around which the joint is articulating) or is outside of it. Anserine bursitis, medial and distal to the knee, is an extremely common cause of chronic knee pain that may respond to a glucocorticoid injection. Prominent nocturnal pain in the absence of end-stage OA merits a distinct workup. For hip pain, OA can be detected by loss of internal rotation on passive movement, and pain isolated to an area lateral to the hip joint usually reflects the presence of trochanteric bursitis.

No blood tests are routinely indicated for workup of patients with OA unless symptoms and signs suggest inflammatory arthritis.

Examination of the synovial fluid is often more helpful diagnostically than an x-ray. If the synovial fluid white count is >1000/μL, inflammatory arthritis or gout or pseudogout is likely, the latter two being also identified by the presence of crystals.

Acute arthritis is the most common early clinical manifestation of gout. Usually, only one joint is affected initially, but polyarticular acute gout can occur in subsequent episodes. The metatarsophalangeal joint of the first toe often is involved, but tarsal joints, ankles, and knees also are affected commonly. Especially in elderly patients or in advanced disease, finger joints may be involved. Inflamed Heberden’s or Bouchard’s nodes may be a first manifestation of gouty arthritis.

Early attacks tend to subside spontaneously within 3–10 days, and most patients have intervals of varying length with no residual symptoms until the next episode. Several events may precipitate acute gouty arthritis: dietary excess, trauma, surgery, excessive ethanol ingestion, hypouricemic therapy, and serious medical illnesses such as myocardial infarction and stroke.

The spectrum of normal sexual response varies from one woman to another and throughout a woman’s lifetime (1–3). Physicians should be aware of their patients’ sexual values, attitudes about specific practices, and concerns about their sexuality. Maintaining open communication with patients about their sexuality allows the physician to counsel them about sexual issues and problems and other aspects of their reproductive health.

Sexual Activity Sexual activity among adolescents in the United States increased during the past 20 years (3). The average age for first intercourse for both men and women is 16 years. By 19 years of age, as many as three-quarters of women have had intercourse. Most young men and young women have multiple serial sexual partners but use condoms inconsistently, thereby exposing themselves to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and unintended pregnancies. A recent study of North American women, using a large and diverse community-based sample, shows that of the 3,205 women aged 30 to 79 years almost one-half were not sexually active in the previous 4 weeks, with 52% of those citing lack of interest and 61% citing lack of partner as the major reasons. Of those who were sexually active recently, 13.7% noted sexual problems and dissatisfaction with their overall sexual lives (4).

After an incubation period that generally lasts 2–7 days (range, 1–14 days), SARS usually begins as a systemic illness marked by the onset of fever, which is often accompanied by malaise, headache, and myalgias and is followed in 1–2 days by a nonproductive cough and dyspnea. Approximately 25% of patients have diarrhea. Chest x-rays can show a variety of infiltrates, including patchy areas of consolidation—most frequently in peripheral and lower lung fields—or interstitial infiltrates, which can progress to diffuse involvement. In severe cases, respiratory function may worsen during the second week of illness and progress to frank adult respiratory distress syndrome accompanied by multiorgan dysfunction. Risk factors for severe disease include an age of >50 years and comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hepatitis. Illness in pregnant women may be particularly severe, but SARS-CoV infection appears to be milder in children than in adults.

Information regarding the clinical manifestations of MERS-CoV is limited. The case–fatality rate has been high in the initial cases, but this may represent an ascertainment bias, and it is clear that mild cases occur as well. The median incubation period has been estimated to be 5.2 days, and a secondary case was estimated to have an incubation period of 9–12 days. Cases have been reported that begin with cough and fever and progress to acute respiratory distress and respiratory failure within a week. Other cases have manifested as mild upper respiratory symptoms only. Renal failure has been noted, and DPP-4, the host cell receptor for MERS-CoV, is expressed at high levels in the kidney; these findings suggest that direct viral infection of the kidney may lead to renal dysfunction. Diarrhea and vomiting are also common in MERS, and pericarditis has been reported.

to clinical effect while antivenom is administered. The patient must be monitored very closely during such therapy, preferably in an intensive care setting. Serum sickness typically develops 1–2 weeks after antivenom administration and may present as fever, chills, urticaria, myalgias, arthralgias, lymphadenopathy, and renal or neurologic dysfunction. Treatment of serum sickness consists of systemic glucocorticoids (e.g., oral prednisone, 1–2 mg/kg daily) until all symptoms have resolved, followed by a taper over 1–2 weeks. Oral antihistamines and analgesics may provide additional relief of symptoms.

Perform an LP; send cell count with differential, glucose and protein levels, Gram stain, and culture.

Empiric antibiotic therapy regimens (ceftriaxone, vancomycin, ampicillin) should be administered until bacterial meningitis can be excluded.

Neonates should receive ampicillin and cefotaxime or gentamicin. Consider acyclovir if there is concern for herpes encephalitis (e.g., if the mother had HSV lesions at the time of the infant’s birth).

Older children should receive ceftriaxone and vancomycin.

A bacterial infection caused by Bordetella pertussis (whooping cough), a grambacillus. The DTaP vaccine (given in five doses in early childhood) is protective, but immunity wanes by adolescence.

One-third of the patients were troubled by vertigo associated with nausea, vomiting, and pressure in the ear. The vertiginous symptoms differed from those of Ménière disease in that discrete attacks separated by periods of normalcy were rare. The vertigo coincided more or less with hearing loss and tinnitus (most often a unilateral high-pitched ringing, sometimes a machinery-like roaring or hissing sound, like that of a steam kettle).

An abdominal mass may be present in the lower abdomen. When the symptoms have been present for more than 4 or 5 days, and an abscess is suspected, it is reasonable to obtain a computerized tomogram of the abdo-men and pelvis with IV, oral, and rectal contrast in order to visu-alize the appendix and the presence of an associated abscess, phlegmon, or fecalith (Fig. 39-21).An individualized approach is necessary for the child who presents

Table 126-2 lists the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain in children. The urgent task of the clinician is to rule out surgical emergencies. In young children, malrotation with volvulus, incarcerated hernia, congenital anomalies, and intussusception are common concerns. In older children and teenagers, appendicitis is more common. An acute surgical abdomen is characterized by signs of peritonitis, including tenderness, abdominal wall rigidity, guarding, and absent or diminished bowel sounds. Helpful characteristics of onset, location, referral, and quality of pain are noted in Table 126-3.

Recurrent abdominal pain is a common problem, affecting more than 10% of all children. The peak incidence occurs between ages 7 and 12 years. Although the differential diagnosis of recurrent abdominal pain is fairly extensive (Table 126-4),most children do not have a serious (or even identifiable) underlying illness causing the pain.

often inconsistent; patients may move a paralyzed extremity when they think that no one is watching.

Nonepileptic seizures, sometimes described as pseudoseizures, resemble epileptic seizures but are not associated withthe electroencephalographic abnormalities or a clinical coursecharacteristic of true epilepsy. Most cases resolve within 3months of diagnosis. Referring to nonclassic presentations for seizures as spells can help avoid medicalization of these symptoms.

The course of the condition is often benign, although20% to 25% of patients experience a recurrence. Goodprognostic characteristics include symptoms of paralysis, aphonia, blindness; acute onset; above-average intelligence; presence of an identifiable stressor; and earlydiagnosis and psychiatric treatment. Poor prognostic characteristics include tremor and pseudoseizures. The rate ofmisdiagnosis of conversion symptoms averages 4%. Myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, dystonias, and dyskinesias(abnormal movements) are conditions commonly mistakenfor conversion disorder.

Pain disorder is diagnosed instead of a conversion disorder if pain is the predominant physical symptom. The DSM-IV divides pain disorders into those associated with psychological factors, those with both psychological and medical factors, and those in which the medical condition is the major factor in the pain symptom (Table 16-5). The diagnosis is considered acute if the condition lasts less than 6 months and chronic when it lasts 6 months or more.

RAP is the most common recurrent pain complaint of childhood and accounts for 2% to 4% of pediatric office visits. It is defined by intermittent pain with full recovery between episodes lasting more than 3 months. There is a strong relation between RAP and anxiety in children. Approximately 90% of pediatric patients have no clinical findings to account for their abdominal pain.

Ostium primum defects present in early childhood with findings of a murmur or fatigue with exertion. Ostium secundum defects (most common) tend to present in late childhood or early adulthood. Symptom onset and severity depend on the size of the defect.

Symptoms of easy fatigability, frequent respiratory infections, and FTT can be observed, but patients are frequently asymptomatic.

ASD has a f xed, widely split S2.

■Exam reveals a right ventricular heave; a wide and fxed, split S2; and a systolic ejection murmur at the upper left sternal border (from ↑ ﬂ ow across the pulmonary valve). There may also be a mid-diastolic rumble at the left lower sternal border.

Echocardiogram with color ﬂow Doppler reveals blood ﬂow between the atria (diagnostic), paradoxical ventricular wall motion, and a dilated right ventricle.

ECG most commonly shows right axis deviation and RVH, although other patterns are possible depending on the type of defect. PR prolongation is common.

CXR reveals cardiomegaly and ↑ pulmonary vascular markings.

Most lesions are small defects that may close spontaneously and do not require treatment.

Surgical closure is indicated in infants with CHF and in patients with more than a 2:1 ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood ﬂow. Early correction prevents complications such as arrhythmias, right ventricular dysfunction, and Eisenmenger’s syndrome.

Failure of the ductus arteriosus to close in the first few days of life, leading to a left-to-right shunt from the aorta to the pulmonary artery. Risk factors include maternal first-trimester rubella infection, prematurity, and female gender.

Typically asymptomatic; patients with large defects may present with FTT, recurrent lower respiratory tract infections, lower extremity clubbing, and CHF.

Exam reveals a wide pulse pressure; a continuous “machinery murmur” at the second left intercostal space at the sternal border; a loud S2; and bounding peripheral pulses.

Total anomalous pulmonary venous return accounts for about 1% of congenital heart disease (Fig. 144-5). Disruption of the development of normal pulmonary venous drainage during the third week of gestation results in one of four abnormalities. All of the pulmonary veins fail to connect to the left atrium and return abnormally via the right side of the heart. They may have supracardiac, infracardiac, cardiac, or mixed drainage. An atrial-level communication is required for systemic cardiac output and survival.

The most important determinant of presentation is the presenceor absence of obstruction to the pulmonary venous drainage.Infants without obstruction have minimal cyanosis and may beasymptomatic. There is a hyperactive right ventricular impulse with a widely split S2 (owing to increased right ventricular volume) and a systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternalborder. There is usually a mid-diastolic murmur at the lowerleft sternal border from the increased flow across the tricuspidvalve. Growth is relatively poor. Infants with obstruction present with cyanosis, marked tachypnea and dyspnea, and signs ofright-sided heart failure including hepatomegaly. The obstruction results in little, if any, increase in right ventricular volume,so there may be no murmur or changes in S2.

For infants without obstruction, the ECG is consistent with right ventricular volume overload. Cardiomegaly with

increased pulmonary blood flow is seen on chest x-ray. Infants with obstructed veins have right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy on ECG. On chest x-ray, the heart is normal or mildly enlarged with varying degrees of pulmonary edema that can appear similar to hyaline membrane disease or pneumonia. Echocardiography shows the volume-overloaded right side of the heart, right-to-left atrial level shunting, and common pulmonary vein site of drainage and degree of obstruction.

A 42-year-old woman has heterozygous familial hyper-cholesterolemia (HeFH) but is otherwise well and has no symptoms of coronary or peripheral vascular disease. A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother’s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?

Plasma lipids are transported in complexes called lipoproteins. Metabolic disorders that involve elevations in any lipoprotein species are termed hyperlipoproteinemias or hyperlipidemias. Hyperlipemia denotes increased levels of triglycerides.

The major clinical sequelae of hyperlipidemias are acute pancreatitis and atherosclerosis. The former occurs in patients with marked hyperlipemia. Control of triglycerides can prevent recurrent attacks of this life-threatening disease.

An HDL > 60 mg/dL counts as a “negative” risk factor and removes one risk factor from the total score.

■LDL > 130 mg/dL or HDL < 40 mg/dL, even if total serum cholesterol is < 200 mg/dL, is diagnostic of dyslipidemia.

Based on risk stratification (see Table 2.1-11). Risk factors include diabetes (considered a CAD risk equivalent), smoking, hypertension, HDL < 40 mg/dL, age > 45 (males), age > 55 (females), and early CAD in first-degree relatives (males < 55 and females < 65).

The first intervention should be a 12-week trial of diet and exercise in a patient with no known atherosclerotic vascular disease. Commonly used lipid-lowering agents are listed in Table 2.1-12.

and reduced saturated fats and cholesterol (Chap. 421). According to guidelines of the ADA, the target lipid values in diabetic individuals (age >40 years) without CVD should be as follows: LDL <2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL); HDL >1 mmol/L (40 mg/ dL) in men and >13 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) in women; and triglycerides <1.7 mmol/L (150 mg/dL). In patients >40 years, the ADA recommends addition of a statin, regardless of the LDL level, in patients with CHD and those without CHD who have CHD risk factors. Recently released guidelines

The relationship of various factors to the risk of atherosclerosis is described in Chap. 291e. Older age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, tobacco smoking, abnormal blood cholesterol (particularly, low high-density lipoprotein [HDL] and/or elevated low-density lipoprotein [LDL]), and other factors are either proven or probable risk factors for ischemic stroke, largely by their link to atherosclerosis. Risk of stroke is much greater in those with prior stroke or TIA. Many cardiac conditions predispose to stroke, including atrial fibrillation and recent MI. Oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy increase stroke risk, and although rare, certain inherited and acquired hypercoagulable states predispose to stroke.

Hypertension is the most significant of the risk factors; in general, all hypertension should be treated to a target of less than 140– 150/90 mmHg. However, many vascular neurologists recommend that guidelines for secondary prevention of stroke should aim for blood pressure reduction to 130/80 mmHg or lower. The presence of known cerebrovascular disease is not a contraindication to treatment aimed at achieving normotension. Also, the value of treating systolic hypertension in older patients has been clearly established. Lowering blood pressure to levels below those traditionally defining hypertension appears to reduce the risk of stroke even further. Data are particularly strong in support of thiazide diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

factors. Recently released guidelines by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) differ slightly and recommend that diabetic individuals aged 40–75 without CHD and a LDL of 70–189 mg/dl receive “moderate” intensity statin therapy (Chap. 291e). Improvement in glycemic control will lower triglycerides and have a modest beneficial effect by raising HDL.

document (5) 

Based on the guidelines provided by the ADA, priorities in the treatment of dyslipidemia are as follows: (1) lower the LDL cholesterol, (2) raise the HDL cholesterol, and (3) decrease the triglycerides. A treatment strategy depends on the pattern of lipoprotein abnormalities. Initial therapy for all forms of dyslipidemia should include dietary changes, as well as the same lifestyle modifications recommended in the nondiabetic population (smoking cessation, blood pressure control, weight loss, increased physical activity). The dietary recommendations for individuals with DM include increased monounsaturated fat and carbohydrates and reduced saturated fats

4. In a chronic delusional-hallucinatory state in a chronic alcoholic patient (chronic alcoholic hallucinosis) it will usually be disclosed that the illness began when alcohol was withdrawn, after a period of sustained drinking, and at first took the form of an acute auditory hallucinosis characterized by threatening, exteriorized auditory hallucinations to which the patient’s emotional reaction was appropriate. Only later do a few of these patients drift into a quiet hallucinatory, mildly paranoid state, with rather bland affect. Evidence of the prepsychotic schizoid personality cannot be detected and there is usually no family history of schizophrenia. Cases of this type with which we are familiar had their onset between 45 and 50 years of age, that is, much later than the usual age of onset of schizophrenia.

5. A patient who is confused or stuporous and seemingly catatonic-negativistic, refusing or unable to speak, to execute commands, or to be activated in any way. If signs of focal cerebral or brainstem disease are absent, one is tempted to make a diagnosis of catatonic schizophrenia, not appreciating that catatonia as a phenomenon may be indistinguishable from akinetic mutism (see Chap. 15). It may also appear with widespread disease of the associational cortices and as mentioned earlier, with severe depression, certain confusional states, and hysteria. The authors have seen cases of hypoxic and other metabolic encephalopathies, Schilder disease, certain storage diseases, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease mistaken for schizophrenia because of failure to adhere to this principle.

6. A patient with temporal lobe epilepsy who, apart from intermittent psychomotor seizures, has long periods (weeks or months) of hallucinations, delusions, bizarre behavior, and disorganization of thinking. Such a mental disturbance reflects the presence of a persistent state of temporal lobe seizures (temporal lobe status epilepticus), which in some cases has been demonstrated by depth electrodes to originate in the amygdaloid or other medial temporal areas. The nature of the disturbances of emotionality and mentation in such patients, a somewhat controversial subject, is discussed in Chaps. 15 and 24.

Anxiety disorder is a chronic state, some would say a disease, punctuated by recurrent attacks of acute anxiety or panic. The acute attacks are the hallmark of the disease and some psychiatrists are reluctant to make a diagnosis of anxiety neurosis in their absence. Because of the clinical features of panic attacks and particularly their episodic nature, simulating an acute medical condition, they are of special interest to neurologists and general physicians. While anxiety may be inferred from observing the activities of young children, and is reported as a form of nervousness by older children and adolescents, more often there are physical complaints at times of transition or stress during the day or year.

Panic attacks in their full form are prone to begin after this age and are almost as dramatic as seizures. They often begin with distressing feelings of dread and foreboding. The patient is assailed by a sense of strangeness, as though his body had changed or the surroundings were unreal. He is frightened, sometimes by the prospect of imminent death (angor animi) or of losing his mind or self-control. There may be a feeling of smothering. “I am dying” or “I can’t breathe” are characteristic expressions of alarm and panic. The heart races, breathing comes in rapid gasps, the pupils may be dilated, and the patient may sweat or tremble. The palpitation and breathing difficulties are so prominent that a cardiologist is often consulted. Some of our psychiatric colleagues identify breathlessness or a suffocating feeling as central to the diagnosis of panic (and attribute psychologic meaning to the symptom), but this is not sustained in our observations of affected patients. The symptoms abate spontaneously after 15 to 30 min, leaving the patient shaken, tense, perplexed, and often embarrassed. There is no confusion, and after the episode there is full memory of the event.

In chronic subdural hematoma, the traumatic etiology is often less clear. The head injury, especially in elderly persons and in those taking anticoagulant drugs, may have been trivial and forgotten. A period of weeks then follows when headaches (not invariable), light-headedness, slowness in thinking, apathy and drowsiness, unsteady gait, and occasionally a seizure are the main symptoms. The initial impression may be that the patient has a vascular lesion or brain tumor or is suffering from drug intoxication, a depressive illness, or Alzheimer disease. Gradual expansion of the hematoma by one of several mechanisms

document (3) 

one of several mechanisms discussed further on is believed to cause the progression of symptoms. As with acute subdural hematoma, the disturbances of mentation and consciousness (drowsiness, inattentiveness, and confusion) are more prominent than focal or lateralizing signs, and they may fluctuate. Focal signs, when present, consist of mild hemiparesis and, rarely, an aphasic disturbance. Homonymous hemianopia is seldom observed, probably because the geniculocalcarine pathway is deep and not easily compressed; similarly, hemiplegia, that is, complete paralysis of one arm and leg, is usually indicative of a lesion within the cerebral hemisphere

document (4) 

within the cerebral hemisphere rather than a compressive lesion on its surface. Hemiparesis from subdural hematoma may sometimes be ipsilateral to the clot, the result of compression of the contralateral cerebral peduncle against the free edge of the tentorium (Kernohan-Woltman sign; see “Pathoanatomy of Brain Displacement and Herniations” in Chap. 16). If the condition progresses, the patient becomes stuporous or comatose. But this course is often interrupted by striking fluctuations of awareness.

excitement, or certain sustained motor activities. An evoked train of myoclonic jerks may progress to a generalized seizure with loss of consciousness. As the disease advances, the myoclonus interferes increasingly with the patient’s motor activities until voluntary function is seriously impaired. Speech may be marred, much as it is in chorea. Close examination may also reveal an alteration in muscle tone and a slight degree of cerebellar ataxia. At this time, or even before the onset of myoclonus and seizures, the patient may experience visual hallucinations or exhibit irritability, odd traits of character, uninhibited or

document (6) 

Beginning in late childhood and adolescence (11 to 18 years) in a previously normal individual, the disease announces itself by a seizure, a burst of myoclonic jerks, or both. In about half the cases there are focal (often occipital) seizures. The illness may at first be mistaken for ordinary epilepsy, but within a few months it becomes evident that something far more serious is occurring. The myoclonus becomes widespread and can be evoked as a startle by noise, an unexpected tactile stimulus (even the tap of a reflex hammer), and also by excitement, or certain sustained

in the United States take NSAIDs on a regular basis; perhaps even more regularly take aspirin. Persons who take NSAIDs also have a higher hospitalization rate for serious GI events than those who do not.Factors that clearly put patients at increased risk for NSAID-induced GI complications include age >60, prior GI event, high NSAID dose, concurrent steroid intake, and con-current anticoagulant intake. Proton pump inhibitors have been shown to significantly decrease upper GI bleeding risk in patients on chronic warfarin, low dose aspirin, and/or antiplate-let agents.101-103 ANY patient taking NSAIDs or aspirin who has

Mechanism of Action Aspirin produces its antithrombotic effect by irreversibly acetylating and inhibiting platelet cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 (Fig. 143-3), a critical enzyme in the biosynthesis of thromboxane A2. At high doses (~1 g/d), aspirin also inhibits COX-2, an inducible COX isoform found in endothelial cells and inflammatory cells. In endothelial cells, COX-2 initiates the synthesis of prostacyclin, a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation.

Indications Aspirin is widely used for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular disease. Compared with placebo, aspirin produces a 25% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke. Aspirin is also used for primary prevention in patients whose estimated annual risk of MI is >1%, a point where its benefits are likely to outweigh harms. This includes patients older than age 40 years with two or more major risk factors for cardiovascular disease or men older than age 45 years and women over the age of 55 years with one or more such risk factors. Aspirin is equally effective in men and women. In men, aspirin mainly reduces the risk of MI, whereas in women, aspirin lowers the risk of stroke.

Dosages Aspirin is usually administered at doses of 75–325 mg once daily. Higher doses of aspirin are not more effective than lower aspirin doses, and some analyses suggest reduced efficacy with higher doses. Because the side effects of aspirin are dose-related, daily aspirin doses of 75–100 mg are recommended for most indications. When rapid

is similar in men and women. On average, gastric ulcer patients are older than duodenal ulcer patients, and the incidence is increasing in the elderly, perhaps because of increasing NSAID and aspirin.DiagnosisIn the young patient with dyspepsia and without alarm symp-toms, it may be appropriate to initiate empirical PPI therapy for PUD without upper endoscopy or upper GI series. NSAIDs and aspirin should be stopped if the patient is taking these drugs, and Helicobacter should be ruled out with testing and treated if pres-ent. It is prudent to discuss with the patient the

Liver biopsy reveals periductal sclerosis (“onion skinning”).

Tx: High-dose ursodeoxycholic acid; endoscopic dilation and short-term stenting of bile duct strictures; liver transplantation. Patients are at ↑ risk for cholangiocarcinoma.

Liver diseases can be divided into distinct patterns based on LFT results:

Hepatocellular injury: ↑ AST and ALT.

Cholestasis: ↑ alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin.

Isolated hyperbilirubinemia: ↑ bilirubin; normal aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase.

Jaundice, which can be seen in any of the patterns outlined above, is a clinical sign that arises when excess bilirubin (> 2.5 mg/dL) is circulating in the blood. Figures 2.6-9 and 2.6-10 summarize the clinical approaches toward cholestasis and isolated hyperbilirubinemia. Hepatocellular injury is described in the section that follows.

causes of chronic hepatitis include viruses (e.g., HBV, HCV, HDV), alcoholic hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, ischemic hepatitis, and hereditary etiologies (e.g., Wilson’s disease, hemochromatosis, α1-antitrypsin deficiency).

HAV and HEV are transmitted by the fecal-oral route.

Laboratory Features The serum aminotransferases aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (previously designated SGOT and SGPT) increase to a variable degree during the prodromal phase of acute viral hepatitis and precede the rise in bilirubin level (Figs. 360-2 and 360-4). The level of these enzymes, however, does not correlate well with the degree of liver cell damage. Peak levels vary from 400–4000 IU or more; these levels are usually reached at the time the patient is clinically icteric and diminish progressively during the recovery phase of acute hepatitis. The diagnosis of anicteric hepatitis is based on clinical features and on aminotransferase elevations.

Jaundice is usually visible in the sclera or skin when the serum bilirubin value is >43 μmol/L (2.5 mg/dL). When jaundice appears, the serum bilirubin typically rises to levels ranging from 85–340 μmol/L (5–20 mg/dL). The serum bilirubin may continue to rise despite falling serum aminotransferase levels. In most instances, the total bilirubin is equally divided between the conjugated and unconjugated fractions. Bilirubin levels >340 μmol/L (20 mg/dL) extending and persisting late into the course of viral hepatitis are more likely to be associated with severe disease. In certain patients with underlying hemolytic anemia, however, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and sickle cell anemia, a high serum bilirubin level is common, resulting from superimposed hemolysis. In such patients, bilirubin levels >513 μmol/L (30 mg/dL) have been observed and are not necessarily associated with a poor prognosis.

Critically ill patients with alcoholic hepatitis have short-term (30-day) mortality rates >50%. Severe alcoholic hepatitis is heralded by coagulopathy (prothrombin time increased >5 s), anemia, serum albumin concentrations <25 g/L (2.5 mg/dL), serum bilirubin levels >137 μmol/L (8 mg/dL), renal failure, and ascites. A discriminant function calculated as 4.6 X (the prolongation of the prothrombin time above control [seconds]) + serum bilirubin (mg/dL) can identify patients with a poor prognosis (discriminant function >32). A Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score (Chap. 368) ≥21 also is associated with significant mortality in alcoholic hepatitis. The presence of ascites, variceal hemorrhage, deep encephalopathy, or hepatorenal syndrome predicts a dismal prognosis. The pathologic stage of the injury can be helpful in predicting prognosis. Liver biopsy should be performed whenever possible to establish the diagnosis and to guide the therapeutic decisions.

amplification assays remain reactive well below the current 103–104 IU/ mL threshold for infectivity and liver injury. These markers are useful in following the course of HBV replication in patients with chronic hepatitis B receiving antiviral chemotherapy (Chap. 362). Except for the early decades of life after perinatally acquired HBV infection (see above), in immunocompetent adults with chronic hepatitis B, a general correlation exists between the level of HBV replication, as reflected by the level of serum HBV DNA, and the degree of liver injury. High-serum HBV DNA levels, increased expression of viral antigens, and necroinflammatory activity in the liver go hand in hand unless immunosuppression interferes with cytolytic T cell responses to virus-infected cells; reduction of HBV replication with antiviral drugs tends to be accompanied by an improvement in liver histology. Among patients with chronic hepatitis B, high levels of HBV DNA increase the risk of cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma (see “Complications and Sequelae”).

Pituitary Lesions Hypopituitarism is rare because a large portion of the gland must be destroyed before decreased hormonal secretion affects the patient clinically. The pituitary gland may be destroyed by tumors (nonfunctioning or hormone secreting), infarction, or infiltrating lesions such as lymphocytic hypophysitis, granulomatous lesions, and surgical or radiologic ablations. Sheehan syndrome is associated with postpartum necrosis of the pituitary resulting from a hypotensive episode that, in its severe form (pituitary apoplexy), presents with the patient in shock. The patient may develop a localized, severe, retro-orbital headache or abnormalities in visual fields and visual acuity. Patients with a mild form of postpartum pituitary necrosis cannot lactate, lose pubic and axillary hair, and do not menstruate after delivery.

Diabetic vasculitis and sickle cell anemia rarely manifest as pituitary failure. Hypopituitarism is associated with hyposecretion of ACTH and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and gonadotropins; therefore, thyroid and adrenal function must be evaluated. If hypopituitarism occurs before puberty, menses and secondary sexual characteristics will not develop.

Growth hormone (GH), TSH, ACTH, and prolactin are secreted by the pituitary, and the excess production of each by pituitary tumors causes menstrual abnormalities. The menstrual abnormalities are caused by adverse effects of these hormones on the GnRH pulse generator and not by direct effects on the ovary. Prolactinomas are the most common hormone-secreting tumors in the pituitary, as described above.

Clinical Features Manifestations of hypothyroidism include a broad range of signs and symptoms: fatigue, lethargy, cold intolerance, nightmares, dry skin, hair loss, constipation, periorbital carotene deposition (causing a yellow discoloration), carpal tunnel syndrome, weight gain (usually less than 5–10 kg), depression, irritability, hyperlipidemia, and impaired memory. Menstrual dysfunction is common, either as menorrhagia or amenorrhea. Infertility may arise from anovulation, but exogenous thyroid hormone is not useful for anovulatory euthyroid women. The finding of hyperlipidemia may be the first indication of hypothyroidism, especially the presence of high triglycerides. Empirical use of thyroid extract should be discouraged.

Hypothyroidism is not a cause of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), but worsening PMS may be a subtle manifestation of hypothyroidism (44). Hypothyroidism may cause precocious or delayed puberty. Hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea are unusual manifestations of hypothyroidism; however, assessment of thyroid function should be considered. To distinguish primary hypothyroidism from a prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma, TSH levels should be assessed in women who have amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and hyperprolactinemia.

Diagnosis Recommendations for screening for thyroid disorders in women range from every 5 years starting at age 35 in women (American Thyroid Association), to age 50 (American College of Physicians), to periodically in older women (American Academy of Family Physicians and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologist), to evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against screening (United States Preventive Services Task Force) (45–49).

Assessment of Estrogen Status

The presence of vaginal dryness or hot ﬂashes increases the likelihood of a diagnosis of hypoestrogenism. A sample of vaginal secretions can be obtained during the physical examination, and mucosal estrogen response can be demonstrated by the presence of superficial cells. A serum estradiol level higher than 40 pg/mL is considered indicative of significant estrogen production, but interassay discrepancies often exist and serum estrogen levels can vary greatly on a day-today basis for a given woman. Vaginal ultrasound demonstrating a thin endometrium suggests that a patient is hypoestrogenic, unless there is reason to suspect that the patient lacks functional endometrium. A DEXA (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) scan to determine bone mineral density should be considered for a patient in whom long-term hypoestrogenism is suspected.

There is little utility in routine performance of a progestogen challenge test to determine the patient’s estrogen status. False positives and false negatives are common.

Consideration should be given to thyroid disorders and hyperprolactinemia in women with amenorrhea because of the relatively common incidence of these conditions.

1. Sensitive TSH assays can be used to evaluate hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.

Further evaluation of a thyroid disorder is required if abnormalities in TSH levels are found. Mild degrees of thyroid dysfunction are unlikely to cause amenorrhea. Given the general health implications of thyroid dysfunction and readily available treatments, routine assessment of TSH is reasonable for women with amenorrhea.

2. Prolactin is most accurately obtained in a patient who is fasting and who has not had any recent breast stimulation to avoid concluding that a patient is hyperprolactinemic on the basis of a transient prolactin elevation. If a patient still has some menstrual cycles, it is advisable to obtain the prolactin level in the follicular phase.

When sleepiness is severe, automatic behaviors may occur, with the individual continuing his or her activities in a semi-automatic, hazelike fashion without memory or conscious- ness. Approximately 20%—60% of individuals experience vivid hypnagogic hallucinations before or upon falling asleep or hypnopompic hallucinations just after awakening. These hallucinations are distinct from the less Vivid, nonhallucinatory dreamlike mentation at sleep onset that 6ccurs in normal sleepers. Nightmares and vivid dreaming are also fre- quent in narcolepsy, as is REM sleep behavior disorder. Approximately 20%—60% of indi- viduals experience sleep paralysis upon falling asleep or awakening, leaving them awake but unable to move or speak. However, many normal sleepers also report sleep paralysis, especially with stress or sleep deprivation. Nocturnal eating may occur. Obesity is com- mon. Nocturnal sleep disruption with frequent long or short awakenings is common and can be disabling.

Individuals may appear sleepy or fall asleep in the waiting area or during clinical ex- amination. During cataplexy, individuals may slump in a chair and have slurred speech or drooping eyelids. If the clinician has time to check reﬂexes during cataplexy (most attacks are less than 10 seconds), reﬂexes are abolished—an important finding distinguishing gen— uine cataplexy from conversion disorder.

Narcolepsy-cataplexy affects 0.02%—0.04% of the general population in most countries.

IBS is a disorder that affects all ages, although most patients have their first symptoms before age 45. Older individuals have a lower reporting frequency. Women are diagnosed with IBS two to three times as often as men and make up 80% of the population with severe IBS. As indicated in Table 352-1, pain or abdominal discomfort is a key symptom for the diagnosis of IBS. These symptoms should be improved with defecation and/or have their onset associated with a change in frequency or form of stool. Painless diarrhea or constipation does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria to be classified as IBS. Supportive symptoms that are not part of the diagnostic criteria include defecation straining, urgency or a feeling of incomplete bowel movement, passing mucus, and bloating.

Abdominal Pain According to the current IBS diagnostic criteria, abdominal pain or discomfort is a prerequisite clinical feature of IBS. Abdominal pain in IBS is highly variable in intensity and location. It is frequently episodic and crampy, but it may be superimposed on a background of constant ache. Pain may be mild enough to be ignored or it may interfere with daily activities. Despite this, malnutrition due to inadequate caloric intake is exceedingly rare with IBS. Sleep deprivation is also unusual because abdominal pain is almost uniformly present only during waking hours. However, patients with severe IBS frequently wake repeatedly during the night; thus, nocturnal pain is a poor discriminating factor between organic and functional bowel disease. Pain is often exacerbated by eating or emotional stress and improved by passage of flatus or stools. In addition, female patients with IBS commonly report worsening symptoms during the premenstrual and menstrual phases.

The stiffness, slowness of movement, difficulty in turning and sitting down, and hypomimia may suggest a diagnosis of Parkinson disease. However, the facial expression of the PSP patient is more a matter of tonic grimace than of lack of movement, and the lack of tremor, the erect rather than stooped posture, and prominence of oculomotor abnormalities serve to distinguish the two disorders. The signs of pseudobulbar palsy are eventually prominent, and this feature, along with the eye movements, distinguishes the process most conspicuously from other degenerative conditions. The face becomes less expressive (“masked”), speech is slurred in a slowed spastic fashion, quite different from Parkinson disease, the mouth tends to be held open, and swallowing is difficult. Many patients complain of sleep disturbances. The total sleep time and REM sleep are reduced, and spontaneous awakenings during the night are more frequent and longer than in normal individuals of the same age. Complaints of urinary frequency and urgency have also been frequent in advanced cases under our care. Dubois and colleagues proposed an “applause sign” as distinctive to this disease; the patient fails to stop clapping after being asked to do so only 3 times.

The diagnosis often proves difficult to make if the main ocular features are not outstanding. Other features, such as tremor, palilalia, myoclonus, chorea, orofacial dyskinesias, and disturbances of vestibular function, are observed in some cases. Finally the patient becomes anarthric, immobile, and quite helpless. Dementia of some degree is probably present in many cases, but is mild in most. Some patients do become forgetful and appear apathetic and slow in thinking; many others are irritable or at times euphoric.

Onset is typically in children and adolescents/young adults but rarely in older adults.

Two peaks of onset are suggested, at ages 15—25 years and ages 30—35 years. Onset can be abrupt or progressive (over years). Severity is highest when onset is abrupt in children, and then decreases with age or with treatment, so that symptoms such as cataplexy can oc- casionally disappear. Abrupt onset in young, prepubescent children can be associated with obesity and premature puberty, a phenotype more frequently observed since 2009. In adolescents, onset is more difficult to pinpoint. Onset in adults is often unclear, with some individuals reporting having had excessive sleepiness since birth. Once the disorder has manifested, the course is persistent and lifelong.

In 90% of cases, the first symptom to manifest is sleepiness or increased sleep, followed by cataplexy (within 1 year in 50% of cases, within 3 years in 85%). Sleepiness, hypnagogic hallucinations, vivid dreaming, and REM sleep behavior disorder (excessive movements during REM sleep) are early symptoms. Excessive sleep rapidly progresses to an inability to stay awake during the day, and to maintain good sleep at night, without a clear increase in total 24—hour sleep needs. In the first months, cataplexy may be atypical, especially in children. Sleep paralysis usually develops around puberty in children with prepubertal onset. Exacerbations of symptoms suggest lack of compliance with medications or devel- opment of a concurrent sleep disorder, notably sleep apnea.

Young children and adolescents with narcolepsy often develop aggression or behav- ioral problems secondary to sleepiness and / or nighttime sleep disruption. Workload and social pressure increase through high school and college, reducing available sleep time at night. Pregnancy does not seem to modify symptoms consistently. After retirement, indi- viduals typically have more opportunity for napping, reducing the need for stimulants.

Maintaining a regular schedule benefits individuals at all ages.

Temperamental. Parasomnias, such as sleepwalking, bruxism, REM sleep behavior dis- order, and enuresis, may be more common in individuals who develop narcolepsy. Indi- viduals commonly report that they need more sleep than other family members.

In children, it is often an idiopathic condition and treated nonsurgically by radiological reduction.Intussusceptions are far less common and usually have a distinct pathologic lead point, which can be malignant in up to one-half of cases.72 They commonly present with a history of intermittent abdominal pain and signs and symptoms of bowel obstruction.

Intussusception is the “telescoping” of a segment of proximalbowel (the intussusceptum) into downstream bowel (the intussuscipiens). Most cases occur in infants 1 to 2 years old; in this age group, nearly all cases are idiopathic. Viral-induced lymphoidhyperplasia may produce a lead point in these children. In olderchildren, the proportion of cases caused by a pathologic leadpoint increases. In young children, ileocolonic intussusceptionis common; the ileum invaginates into the colon, beginning at ornear the ileocecal valve. When pathologic lead points are present,the intussusception may be ileoileal, jejunoileal, or jejunojejunal.

Available @ StudentConsult.com

An infant with intussusception has sudden onset of crampy abdominal pain; the infant’s knees draw up, and the infant cries out and exhibits pallor with a colicky pattern occurring every 15 to 20 minutes. Feedings are refused. As the intussusception progresses, and obstruction becomes prolonged, bilious vomiting becomes prominent, and the dilated, fatigued intestine generates less pressure and less pain. As the intussuscepted bowel is pulled further and further into the downstream intestine by motility, the mesentery is pulled with it and becomes stretched and compressed. The venous outflow from the intussusceptum is obstructed, leading to edema, weeping of fluid, and congestion with bleeding. Third space fluid losses and “currant jelly” stools result. Another unexpected feature of intussusception is lethargy. Between episodes of pain, the infant is glassy-eyed and groggy and appears to have been sedated. A sausage-shaped mass caused by the swollen, intussuscepted bowel may be palpable in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium.

A 32-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with weakness and hypokalemia. The patient had been very healthy until 2 months previously when he developed intermittent leg weakness. His review of systems was otherwise negative. He denied drug or laxative abuse and was on no medications. Past medical history was unremarkable, with no history of neuromuscular disease. Family history was notable for a sister with thyroid disease. Physical examination was notable only for reduced deep tendon reflexes.

Sodium 139 143 meq/L Potassium 2.0 3.8 meq/L Chloride 105 107 meq/L Bicarbonate 26 29 meq/L BUN 11 16 mg/dL Creatinine 0.6 1.0 mg/dL Calcium 8.8 8.8 mg/dL Phosphate 1.2 mg/dL Albumin 3.8 meq/L TSH 0.08 μIU/L (normal 0.2–5.39) Free T4 41 pmol/L (normal 10–27)

This patient developed hypokalemia due to a redistribution of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular compartments; this pathophysiology was readily apparent following calculation of the TTKG. The TTKG is calculated as (P × U )/(P ×

U ). The expected values for the TTKG are <3 in the presence of hypokalemia and >7–8 in the presence of hyperkalemia (see also Case 2 and Case 8). Alternatively, a urinary K+-to-creatinine ratio of >13 mmol/g creatinine (>1.5 mmol/mmol creatinine) is compatible with excessive renal K+ excretion. In this case, the calculated TTKG was 2.5, consistent with appropriate renal conservation of K+ and a nonrenal cause for hypokalemia. In the absence of significant gastrointestinal loss of K+, the patient was diagnosed with a “redistributive” subtype of hypokalemia.

The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly.

The plasma Na+ concentration on admission was 113 meq/L, with a creatinine of 2.35 (Table 64e-1). At hospital hour 7, the plasma Na+ concentration was 120 meq/L, potassium 5.4 meq/L, chloride 90 64e-5 meq/L, bicarbonate 22 meq/L, BUN 32 mg/dL, creatinine 2.02 mg/dL, glucose 89 mg/dL, total protein 5.0, and albumin 1.9. The hematocrit was 33.9, white count 7.6, and platelets 405. A morning cortisol was 19.5, with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 1.7. The patient was treated with 1 μg of intravenous DDAVP, along with 75 mL/h of intravenous half-normal saline. After the plasma Na+ concentration dropped to 116 meq/L, intravenous fluid was switched to normal saline at the same infusion rate. The subsequent results are shown in Table 64e-1.

This patient presented with hypovolemic hyponatremia and a “prerenal” reduction in GFR, with an increase in serum creatinine. She had experienced diarrhea for some time and manifested an orthostatic tachycardia after a liter of normal saline. As expected for hypovolemic hyponatremia, the urine Na+ concentration was <20 meq/L in the absence of congestive heart failure or other causes of hypervolemic hyponatremia, and she responded to saline hydration with an increase in plasma Na+ concentration and a decrease in creatinine.

Hemodialysis is the most effective and reliable method to reduce plasma K+ concentration; peritoneal dialysis is considerably less effective. Patients with acute kidney injury require temporary, urgent venous access for hemodialysis, with the attendant risks; in contrast, patients with ESRD or advanced chronic kidney disease may have a preexisting venous access. The amount of K+ removed during hemodialysis depends on the relative distribution of K+ between ICF and ECF (potentially affected by prior therapy for hyperkalemia), the type and surface area of the dialyzer used, dialysate and blood flow rates, dialysate flow rate, dialysis duration, and the plasma-to-dialysate K+ gradient.

Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalances and Acid-Base Disturbances: Case Examples David B. Mount, Thomas D. DuBose, Jr. CASE 1 64e

A 23-year-old woman was admitted with a 3-day history of fever, cough productive of blood-tinged sputum, confusion, and orthostasis. Past medical history included type 1 diabetes mellitus. A physical examination in the emergency department indicated postural hypo-tension, tachycardia, and Kussmaul respiration. The breath was noted to smell of “acetone.” Examination of the thorax suggested consolidation in the right lower lobe.

The diagnosis of the acid-base disorder should proceed in a stepwise fashion: 1.

The normal anion gap (AG) is 8–10 meq/L, but in this case, the AG is elevated (20 meq/L). Therefore, the change in AG (ΔAG) = ~10 meq/L.

A 65-year-old man has a history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease with baseline creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL. Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2–3+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?

Abnormalities in fluid volume and electrolyte composition are common and important clinical disorders. Drugs that block specific transport functions of the renal tubules are valuable clinical tools in the treatment of these disorders. Although various agents that increase urine volume (diuretics) have been described since antiquity, it was not until 1937 that carbonic anhydrase inhibitors were first described and not until 1957 that a much more useful and powerful diuretic agent (chlorothiazide) became available.

The cardinal signs are colicky abdominal pain, abdominal distention, emesis, and obstipation. More intraluminal fluid accumulates in patients with distal obstruction, which typically leads to greater distention, more discomfort, and delayed emesis. This emesis is feculent when there is bacterial overgrowth. Patients with more proximal obstruction commonly present with less abdominal distention but more pronounced vomiting. Elements of the history that might be helpful include any prior history of surgery, including herniorrhaphy, as well as any history of cancer or inflammatory bowel disease.

Most patients, even with simple obstruction, appear to be critically ill. Many may be oliguric, hypotensive, and tachycardic because of severe intravascular volume depletion. Fever is worrisome for strangulation or systemic inflammatory changes. Bowel sounds and bowel functional activity are notoriously difficult to interpret. Classically, many patients with early small-bowel obstruction will have high-pitched, “musical” tinkling bowel sounds and peristaltic “rushes” known as borborygmi. Later in the course of disease, the bowel sounds may be absent or hypoactive as peristaltic activity decreases. This is in contrast to the common findings in patients with ileus or pseudo-obstruction where bowel sounds are typically absent or hypoactive from the beginning. Lastly, patients with partial blockage may continue to pass flatus and stool, and those with complete blockage may evacuate bowel contents present downstream beyond their obstruction.

All surgical incisions should be examined. The presence of a tender abdominal or groin mass strongly suggests that an incarcerated hernia may be the cause of obstruction. The presence of tenderness

IBS is a disorder that affects all ages, although most patients have their first symptoms before age 45. Older individuals have a lower reporting frequency. Women are diagnosed with IBS two to three times as often as men and make up 80% of the population with severe IBS. As indicated in Table 352-1, pain or abdominal discomfort is a key symptom for the diagnosis of IBS. These symptoms should be improved with defecation and/or have their onset associated with a change in frequency or form of stool. Painless diarrhea or constipation does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria to be classified as IBS. Supportive symptoms that are not part of the diagnostic criteria include defecation straining, urgency or a feeling of incomplete bowel movement, passing mucus, and bloating.

Abdominal Pain According to the current IBS diagnostic criteria, abdominal pain or discomfort is a prerequisite clinical feature of IBS. Abdominal pain in IBS is highly variable in intensity and location. It is frequently episodic and crampy, but it may be superimposed on a background of constant ache. Pain may be mild enough to be ignored or it may interfere with daily activities. Despite this, malnutrition due to inadequate caloric intake is exceedingly rare with IBS. Sleep deprivation is also unusual because abdominal pain is almost uniformly present only during waking hours. However, patients with severe IBS frequently wake repeatedly during the night; thus, nocturnal pain is a poor discriminating factor between organic and functional bowel disease. Pain is often exacerbated by eating or emotional stress and improved by passage of flatus or stools. In addition, female patients with IBS commonly report worsening symptoms during the premenstrual and menstrual phases.

Bowel sounds are hypoactive and are substantially decreased with peritonitis related to a ruptured diverticular abscess. Abdominal examination reveals distention with left lower quadrant tenderness on direct palpation and localized rebound tenderness. Abdominal and bimanual rectovaginal examinations may reveal a poorly mobile, doughy inﬂammatory mass in the left lower quadrant. Leukocytosis and fever are common. Stool guaiac may be positive as a result of inﬂammation of the colon or microperforation.

CT with and without contrast is an important adjunct to history and physical examination (30). It will reveal a swollen, edematous bowel and can rule out an abscess. A barium enema is contraindicated. Diverticulitis is initially managed medically with intravenous administration of ﬂuids, strict restriction of oral intake, and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. A diverticular abscess, obstruction, fistula, or perforation requires general surgical intervention.

Intestinal Obstruction The most common causes of intestinal obstruction in women are postsurgical adhesions, hernia formation, inﬂammatory bowel disease, or carcinoma of the bowel or ovary.

Intestinal obstruction is heralded by the onset of colicky abdominal pain followed by abdominal distention, vomiting, constipation, and obstipation. Higher and more acute obstruction results in early vomiting. Colonic obstruction presents with a greater degree of abdominal distention and obstipation. Vomiting first consists of gastric contents, followed by bile, then material with feculent odor, depending on the level of obstruction.

Fever is often present in the late stages. At the onset of mechanical obstruction, bowel sounds are high pitched and maximal during an episode of colicky pain. As the obstruction progresses, bowel sounds decrease and, when absent, suggest ischemic bowel. Marked abdominal distention often ensues.

Pain arising from spinal nerves or roots comes and goes suddenly and is of a lancinating type (Chap. 22). It may be caused by herpes zoster, impingement by arthritis, tumors, a herniated nucleus pulposus, diabetes , or syphilis. It is not associated with food intake, abdominal distention, or changes in respiration. Severe muscle spasm, as in the gastric crises of tabes dorsalis, is common but is either relieved or not accentuated by abdominal palpation. The pain is made worse by movement of the spine and is usually confined to a few dermatomes. Hyperesthesia is very common.

Pain due to functional causes conforms to none of the aforementioned patterns. Mechanisms of disease are not clearly established. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. The diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical criteria (Chap. 352) and after exclusion of demonstrable structural abnormalities. The episodes of abdominal pain are often brought on by stress, and the pain varies considerably in type and location. Nausea and vomiting are rare. Localized tenderness and muscle spasm are inconsistent or absent. The causes of IBS or related functional disorders are not known.

Assessment of Screening Tests Good clinical trial design can offset some biases of screening and demonstrate the relative risks and benefits of a screening test. A randomized controlled screening trial with cause-specific mortality as the endpoint provides the strongest support for a screening intervention. Overall mortality should also be reported to detect an adverse effect of screening and treatment on other disease outcomes (e.g., cardiovascular disease). In a randomized trial, two like populations are randomly established. One is given the usual standard of care (which may be no screening at all) and the other receives the screening intervention being assessed. The two populations are compared over time. Efficacy for the population studied is established when the group receiving the screening test has a better cause-specific mortality rate than the control group. Studies showing a reduction in the incidence of advanced-stage disease, improved survival, or a stage shift are weaker (and possibly misleading) evidence of benefit. These latter criteria are early indicators but not sufficient to establish the value of a screening test.

Although a randomized, controlled screening trial provides the strongest evidence to support a screening test, it is not perfect. Unless the trial is population-based, it does not remove the question of generalizability to the target population. Screening trials generally involve thousands of persons and last for years. Less definitive study designs are therefore often used to estimate the effectiveness of screening practices. However, every nonrandomized study design is subject to strong confounders. In descending order of strength, evidence may also be derived from the findings of internally controlled trials using intervention allocation methods other than randomization (e.g., allocation by birth date, date of clinic visit); the findings of analytic observational studies; or the results of multiple time series studies with or without the intervention.

With their ever-increasing number and scope, clinical laboratory tests provide the clinician with a powerful set of tools but pose challenges in terms of appropriate selection and judicious, cost-effective use to deliver effective patient care.

One of the most frequent reasons for performing clinical laboratory tests is to support, confirm, or refute a diagnosis of disease that is suspected on the basis of other information sources, such as history, physical examination findings, and imaging studies. The following questions need to be considered: Which clinical laboratory tests may be of value in supporting, confirming, or excluding the clinical impression? What is the most efficient test-ordering strategy? Will a positive test result confirm the clinical impression or even definitively establish the diagnosis? Will a negative result disprove the clinical suspicion, and, if so, what further testing or alternative approach will be needed? What are the known sources of false-positive and false-negative results, and how are these misleading results recognized?

Another reason for ordering clinical laboratory tests is to screen for disease in asymptomatic individuals (Chap. 4). Perhaps the most common examples of this application are the newborn screening programs now routinely used in most developed countries. Their purpose is to identify newborns with treatable conditions for which early intervention—even before clinical symptoms develop—is known to be beneficial. In adults, screening tests for diabetes mellitus, renal disease, prostate cancer (measurement of serum prostate-specific antigen [PSA] levels), and colorectal cancer (testing for occult blood in stool), for example, are widely applied to apparently healthy individuals on the grounds that early diagnosis and intervention lead to improved long-term outcomes.

Differences between Screening Tests and Confirmatory Tests It is important to distinguish between clinical laboratory tests that can be used to screen for disease and those that offer a confirmatory result. Screening tests are generally less expensive and more widely available than are confirmatory tests, which often require more specialized equipment or personnel. As a general principle, screening tests are designed to identify all individuals who have the disease of interest, even if, in the process, some healthy individuals are misidentified as possibly having the disease. In other words, maximization of the diagnostic sensitivity of screening tests inevitably comes at the expense of reduced diagnostic specificity. Confirmatory testing is intended to correctly separate those individuals who have a disease from those who do not.

The thoughtful use of screening tests (e.g., measurement of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) may be of great value. A group of laboratory values can conveniently be obtained with a single specimen at relatively low cost. Screening tests are most informative when they are directed toward common diseases or disorders and when their results indicate whether other useful—but often costly—tests or interventions are needed. On the one hand, biochemical measurements, together with simple laboratory determinations such as blood count, urinalysis, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, often provide a major clue to the presence of a pathologic process. On the other hand, the physician must learn to evaluate occasional screening-test abnormalities that do not necessarily connote significant disease. An in-depth workup after the report of an isolated laboratory abnormality in a person who is otherwise well is almost invariably wasteful and unproductive. Because so many tests are performed routinely for screening purposes, it is not unusual for one or two values to be slightly abnormal. Nevertheless, even if there is no reason to suspect an underlying illness, tests yielding abnormal results ordinarily are repeated to rule out laboratory error. If an abnormality is confirmed, it is important to consider its potential significance in the context of the patient’s condition and other test results.

The development of technically improved imaging studies with greater sensitivity and specificity proceeds apace. These tests provide remarkably detailed anatomic information that can be a pivotal factor in medical decision-making. Ultrasonography, a variety of isotopic scans, CT, MRI, and positron emission tomography have supplanted older, more invasive approaches and opened new diagnostic vistas. In light of their capabilities and the rapidity with which they can lead to a diagnosis, it is tempting to order a battery of imaging studies. All physicians have had experiences in which imaging studies revealed findings that led to an unexpected diagnosis. Nonetheless, patients must endure each of these tests, and the added cost of unnecessary testing is substantial. Furthermore, investigation of an unexpected abnormal finding may be associated with risk and/or expense and may lead to the diagnosis of an irrelevant or incidental problem. A skilled physician must learn to use these powerful diagnostic tools judiciously, always considering whether the results will alter management and benefit the patient.

CHAPTER 405 Disorders of the Thyroid Gland 2288 LABORATORY EVALUATION Measurement of Thyroid Hormones The enhanced sensitivity and specificity of TSH assays have greatly improved laboratory assessment of thyroid function. Because TSH levels change dynamically in response to alterations of T4 and T3, a logical approach to thyroid testing is to first determine whether TSH is suppressed, normal, or elevated. With rare exceptions (see below), a normal TSH level excludes a primary abnormality of thyroid function. This strategy depends on the use of immunochemiluminometric assays (ICMAs) for TSH that are sensitive enough to discriminate between the

The physical examination may reveal a mucopurulent discharge (mucopus) issuing from the cervical os. Because Gram’s stain is not sensitive for the diagnosis of gonorrhea in women, specimens should be submitted for culture or a nonculture assay (see “Laboratory Diagnosis,” below). Edematous and friable cervical ectopy and endocervical bleeding induced by gentle swabbing are more often seen in chlamydial infection. Gonococcal infection may extend deep enough to produce dyspareunia and lower abdominal or back pain. In such cases, it is imperative to consider a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and to administer treatment for that disease (Chaps. 163 and 213).

N. gonorrhoeae may also be recovered from the urethra and rectum of women with cervicitis, but these are rarely the only infected sites. Urethritis in women may produce symptoms of internal dysuria, which is often attributed to “cystitis.” Pyuria in the absence of bacteriuria seen on Gram’s stain of unspun urine, accompanied by urine cultures that fail to yield >102 colonies of bacteria usually associated with urinary tract infection, signifies the possibility of urethritis due to C. trachomatis. Urethral infection with N. gonorrhoeae may also occur in this context, but in this instance urethral cultures are usually positive.

Figure 14.10 Vulvar aphthosis in prepubertal girl.

The symptom of vaginal discharge in the prepubertal age group is almost always caused by inﬂammation and irritation. In prepubertal girls, the primary site typically is the vulva, with vaginitis following secondarily, whereas in adolescents and adults, vaginitis typically is the primary finding with vulvitis occurring secondarily. Sexual abuse should always be considered in prepubertal children with vaginal discharge or a foreign body (47). Although the routine use of cultures to detect sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in girls with a history of sexual abuse was questioned, vaginal culture for gonorrhea and chlamydia should be performed in girls who have symptoms that include vaginal discharge (48). In prepubertal girls, vulvovaginitis is usually caused by multiple organisms that are present in the perineal area, although a single organism such as Streptococcus, or even rarely Shigella, may be causative (49). When the cause is related to poor perineal hygiene, cultures often reveal a mixture of bacterial organisms. In this situation, the typical history is intermittent symptoms of irritation, itching, discharge, and odor over many months to years. Treatment should be initiated with a focus on hygiene and cleansing measures (40). A short-term (less than 4 weeks) course of treatment with topical estrogens and broad-spectrum antibiotics may be necessary. The problem is frequently recurrent. In girls who have a relatively acute onset of vaginal discharge and vulvovaginal symptoms, a single bacterial organism is more likely to be the cause of their symptoms.

Pokorny and Stormer described a technique for obtaining vaginal cultures and for performing vaginal irrigation (50). A catheter within a catheter can be fashioned using the tubing from an intravenous butterﬂy setup within a sterile urethral catheter. Nonbacteriostatic saline (1–3 mL) can be injected, aspirated, and sent for culture (Fig. 14.11). Cultures taken in this manner are almost always better tolerated than cultures obtained using a cotton-tipped applicator. A larger quantity of saline can be used to irrigate the vagina while the catheter is still within the vagina. Small foreign bodies can often be ﬂushed from the vagina in this manner. The most common foreign body is a small piece of toilet paper, although children will place other objects (toys, beans, coins) within their vaginas (Fig. 14.5). A persistent vaginal discharge after treatment or a discharge that is bloody or brown in color without other obvious external lesions should prompt vaginal irrigation or vaginoscopy to rule out a foreign body (12).

Figure 14.11 Catheter technique for obtaining vaginal culture and irrigation.

The adolescent’s experience and expression of illness and pain should be viewed within the context of her life experiences. Most adolescents have limited life experiences with problems such as pain, discomfort, or bleeding. An adolescent may state that she is experiencing the “worst pain of her life” and yet may appear to be reasonably comfortable. She may well be stating the truth about this experience, which the clinician must still interpret differently from the symptoms of an adult woman who, for instance, may be in active labor. It should be remembered that an individual’s response to illness and pain is to some extent a learned behavior.

Treatment of UTIs is based on the results of quantitative urine cultures (Chap. 162). The most common pathogens are Escherichia coli, nosocomial gram-negative bacilli, enterococci, and Candida. Several caveats apply in the treatment of institutionally acquired infection. First, in patients with chronic indwelling bladder catheters, especially those in long-term-care facilities, “catheter flora”—microorganisms living on encrustations within the catheter lumen—may differ from actual urinary tract pathogens. Therefore, for suspected UTI in the setting of chronic catheterization (especially in women), it is useful to replace the bladder catheter and to obtain

document (4) 

catheter and to obtain a freshly voided urine specimen. Second, as in all nosocomial infections, at the time treatment is initiated on the basis of a positive culture, it is useful to repeat the culture to verify the persistence of infection. Third, the frequency with which UTIs occur may lead to the erroneous assumption that the urinary tract alone is the source of infection in a febrile hospitalized patient. Fourth, recovery of Staphylococcus aureus from urine cultures may result from hematogenous seeding and may indicate an occult systemic infection. Finally, although Candida is now the most

The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly.

The plasma Na+ concentration on admission was 113 meq/L, with a creatinine of 2.35 (Table 64e-1). At hospital hour 7, the plasma Na+ concentration was 120 meq/L, potassium 5.4 meq/L, chloride 90 64e-5 meq/L, bicarbonate 22 meq/L, BUN 32 mg/dL, creatinine 2.02 mg/dL, glucose 89 mg/dL, total protein 5.0, and albumin 1.9. The hematocrit was 33.9, white count 7.6, and platelets 405. A morning cortisol was 19.5, with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 1.7. The patient was treated with 1 μg of intravenous DDAVP, along with 75 mL/h of intravenous half-normal saline. After the plasma Na+ concentration dropped to 116 meq/L, intravenous fluid was switched to normal saline at the same infusion rate. The subsequent results are shown in Table 64e-1.

This patient presented with hypovolemic hyponatremia and a “prerenal” reduction in GFR, with an increase in serum creatinine. She had experienced diarrhea for some time and manifested an orthostatic tachycardia after a liter of normal saline. As expected for hypovolemic hyponatremia, the urine Na+ concentration was <20 meq/L in the absence of congestive heart failure or other causes of hypervolemic hyponatremia, and she responded to saline hydration with an increase in plasma Na+ concentration and a decrease in creatinine.

His review of systems was otherwise negative. He denied drug or laxative abuse and was on no medications. Past medical history was unremarkable, with no history of neuromuscular disease. Family history was notable for a sister with thyroid disease. Physical examination was notable only for reduced deep tendon reflexes.

This patient developed hypokalemia due to a redistribution of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular compartments; this pathophysiology was readily apparent following calculation of the TTKG. The TTKG is calculated as (P × U )/(P ×

U ). The expected values for the TTKG are <3 in the presence of hypokalemia and >7–8 in the presence of hyperkalemia (see also Case 2 and Case 8). Alternatively, a urinary K+-to-creatinine ratio of >13 mmol/g creatinine (>1.5 mmol/mmol creatinine) is compatible with excessive renal K+ excretion. In this case, the calculated TTKG was 2.5, consistent with appropriate renal conservation of K+ and a nonrenal cause for hypokalemia. In the absence of significant gastrointestinal loss of K+, the patient was diagnosed with a “redistributive” subtype of hypokalemia.

Screening tests can be categorized as general screening teststhat cover all behavioral domains or as targeted screens thatfocus on one area of development. Some may be administered in the office by professionals, and others may be completed athome (or in a waiting room) by parents. Good developmental/behavioral screening instruments have a sensitivity of 70% to80% in detecting suspected problems and a specificity of 70% to80% in detecting normal development. Although 30% of children screened may be over-referred for definitive developmentaltesting, this group also includes children whose skills are belowaverage and who may benefit from testing that may help addressrelative developmental deficits. The 20% to 30% of children whohave disabilities that are not detected by the single administration of a screening instrument are likely to be identified onrepeat screening at subsequent health maintenance visits.

The role of liver biopsy in the diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis has been reassessed as a result of the widespread availability of genetic testing for the C282Y mutation. The absence of severe fibrosis can be accurately predicted in most patients using clinical and biochemical variables. Thus, there is virtually no risk of severe fibrosis in a C282Y homozygous subject with (1) serum ferritin level less than 1000 μg/L, (2) normal serum alanine aminotransferase values, (3) no hepatomegaly, and (4) no excess alcohol intake. However, it should be emphasized that liver biopsy is the only reliable method for establishing or excluding the presence of hepatic cirrhosis, which is the critical factor determining prognosis and the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Biopsy also permits histochemical estimation of tissue iron and measurement of hepatic iron concentration. Increased density of the liver due to iron deposition can be demonstrated by computed tomography (CT) or MRI, and with improved technology, MRI has become more accurate in determining hepatic iron concentration.

When the diagnosis of hemochromatosis is established, it is important to counsel and screen other family members (Chap. 84). Asymptomatic and symptomatic family members with the disease usually have an increased saturation of transferrin and an increased serum ferritin concentration. These changes occur even before the iron stores are greatly increased (Fig. 428-2). All adult first-degree relatives of patients with hemochromatosis should be tested for the C282Y and H63D mutations and counseled appropriately (Fig. 428-3). In affected individuals, it is important to confirm or exclude the presence of cirrhosis and begin therapy as early as possible. For children of an identified proband, testing for HFE of the other parent is helpful because if

Carcinoma of the thyroid is rare in children (1% of all pediatric cancers in the 5to 9-year-old age group and up to 7% of cancers in the 15to 19-year-old age group). Papillary and follicular carcinomas represent 90% of childhood thyroid cancers. A history of therapeutic head or neck irradiation or radiation exposure from nuclear accidents predisposes a child to thyroid cancer. Carcinoma usually presents as a firm to hard, painless nonfunctional solitary nodule and may spread to adjacent lymph nodes. Rapid growth, hoarseness (recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement), and lung metastasis may be present. If the nodule is solid on ultrasound, is cold on radioiodine scanning, and feels hard, the likelihood of a carcinoma is high. Excisional biopsy usually is performed, but FNA biopsy also may be diagnostic.

Treatment includes total thyroidectomy, selective regional node dissection, and radioablation with 131I for residual or recurrent disease. The prognosis is usually good if the disease is diagnosed early.

Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid may be asymptomatic except for a mass. Diagnosis is based on the presenceof elevated calcitonin levels, either in the basal state or after pentagastrin stimulation (difficult to obtain) and histologicexamination. This tumor most often occurs with multipleendocrine neoplasia 2a or 2b (MEN), possibly in a familial pattern. In some families, the presence of mutations ofthe RET proto-oncogene is predictive of the development of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. The location of the mutation can help determine when removal of the thyroid iswarranted. Genetic screening of other members of the family is indicated after a proband is recognized. Prophylacticthyroidectomy is indicated for the family members with thesame allele.

There is emerging evidence that genetic subtyping provides important additional prognostic information.

Diffuse astrocytomas can be static for several years, but at some point they progress; the mean survival is more than 5 years. Eventually, patients suffer rapid clinical deterioration that is correlated with the appearance of anaplastic features and more rapid tumor growth. Other patients present with glioblastoma from the outset. Once the histologic features of glioblastoma appear, the prognosis is very poor; with treatment (resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy), the median survival is only 15 months.

half to three-fourths are primary tumors, and the rest are metastatic. Tumors of the CNS make up a larger propor- tion of childhood cancers, accounting for as many of 20% of all pediatric tumors. Childhood CNS tumors differ from those in adults in both histologic subtype and location. In childhood, tumors are likely to arise in the posterior fossa, whereas tumors in adults are mostly supratentorial.

Tumors of the nervous system have unique characteristics that set them apart from neoplastic processes elsewhere in the body.

These tumors do not have morphologically evident premalignant or in situ stages comparable to those of carcinomas.

Even low-grade lesions may infiltrate large regions of the brain, leading to serious clinical deficits, inability to be resected, and poor prognosis.

The anatomic site of the neoplasm can influence outcome independent of histologic classification due to local effects (e.g., a benign meningioma may cause cardiorespiratory arrest from compression of the medulla).

Even the most highly malignant gliomas rarely spread outside of the CNS.

2023-11-29 14:13:13,034 query: A 78-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of painful enlarging bruises and skin ulceration over his thighs and external genitalia. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, mitral regurgitation, and atrial fibrillation. Three days ago, he was started on treatment with warfarin. His only other medications are metformin and lisinopril. His temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F), pulse is 108/min and irregularly irregular, and blood pressure is 155/89 mm Hg. Examination of the skin shows large purpura, hemorrhagic bullae, and areas of skin necrosis over his anterior legs, gluteal region, and penis. This patient is most likely to benefit from treatment with which of the following?

9The skin demonstrates hemorrhagic bullae and subsequent frank necrosis, with surrounding areas of inflammation and edema. The fascial necrosis is usually wider than the skin involvement or than the surgeon estimates on clinical grounds. The patient is toxic and has high fever, tachycardia, and marked hypovo-lemia, which if uncorrected, progresses to cardiovascular col-lapse. Bacteriologically, this is a mixed infection, and samples should be obtained for Gram stain smears and cultures to aid in diagnosis and treatment. As soon as bacteriologic studies have been obtained, high-dose penicillin treatment needs to be started (20–40

Diagnosed by the history and clinical appearance.

Prevention is key and involves routinely moving bedridden patients and using special beds that distribute pressure. Once an ulcer has developed, low-grade lesions can be treated with routine wound care, including hydrocolloid dressings. High-grade lesions require surgical debridement.

Defined as necrosis of body tissue. There are three subtypes: dry, wet, and gas. The presence of one subtype does not exclude the others. Etiologies are as follows:

Dry gangrene: Due to insufficient blood ﬂow to tissue, typically from atherosclerosis.

Wet gangrene: Involves bacterial infection, usually with skin ﬂ ora.

Gas gangrene: Due to Clostridium perfringens infection.

Dry gangrene: Early signs are a dull ache, cold, and pallor of the ﬂ esh. As necrosis sets in, the tissue (usually a toe) becomes bluish-black, dry, and shriveled. Diabetes, vasculopathy, and smoking are risk factors.

Wet gangrene: The tissue appears bruised, swollen, or blistered with pus.

Gas gangrene: Typically occurs at a site of recent injury or surgery, presenting with swelling around the injury and with skin that turns pale and then dark red. Bacteria are rapidly destructive of tissue, producing gas that separates healthy tissue and exposes it to infection. A medical emergency.

Diagnosed by clinical impression.

Surgical debridement, with amputation if necessary, is the mainstay of treatment. Antibiotics alone do not suffice by virtue of inadequate blood ﬂow, but they should be given as an adjuvant to surgery.

Gas gangrene can be treated with hyperbaric oxygen, which is toxic to the anaerobic C. perfringens. Susceptible patients should maintain careful foot care and should avoid trauma.

A condition in which the skin in the intertriginous zones (genital and axillary regions and especially the nape of the neck) is hyperkeratotic and hyperpigmented with a velvety appearance (see Figure 2.2-12).

Acne first develops at puberty and typically persists for several years. Males are more likely to have severe, cystic acne than are females. Women in their 20s tend to have a variant that ﬂares cyclically with menstruation, featuring fewer comedones and more painful lesions on the chin. Androgenic stimulation may contribute to these lesions.

Diagnosed by the clinical picture.

Treat comedones with topical tretinoin (Retin-A) and benzoyl peroxide.

Inﬂammatory lesions should be treated with topical antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clindamycin) or systemic agents (e.g., tetracycline, erythromycin).

Isotretinoin (Accutane) leads to marked improvement in > 90% of acne patients and has greatly improved the treatment of severe acne.

Isotretinoin is, however, a teratogen and may cause transient elevations in cholesterol, triglycerides, and LFTs, and it may also be associated with depression.

Patients on isotretinoin are thus carefully monitored and are required to get monthly blood tests to check quantitative serum β-hCG (to rule out pregnancy), LFTs, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Monthly refills are contingent on completion of blood testing and evaluation by a dermatologist.

Abscesses in the sacrococcygeal region that usually occur near the top of the natal cleft. Their name may not be appropriate, as not all such cysts contain hair, and not all are true cysts. Repetitive trauma to the region plays a role. The condition is thought to start as a folliculitis that becomes an abscess complicated by perineal microbes, especially Bacteroides. It most commonly occurs between the ages of 20 and 40, affecting men more often than women.

Patients present with an abscess at the natal cleft that can be tender, ﬂ uctuant, warm, and indurated and is sometimes associated with purulent drainage or cellulitis. Systemic symptoms are uncommon, but cysts may develop into perianal fistulas.

A bleeding score has been validated as a tool to predict patients more likely to have type 1 VWD (International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis Bleeding Assessment Tool [www.isth .org/resource/resmgr/ssc/isth-ssc_bleeding_assessment.pdf ]). This is most useful tool in excluding the diagnosis of a bleeding disorder, and thus avoiding unnecessary testing. One study found that a low bleeding score (≤3) and a normal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) had 99.6% negative predictive value for the diagnosis of VWD. Bleeding symptoms that appear to be more common in patients with bleeding disorders include prolonged bleeding with surgery, dental procedures and extractions, and/or trauma, menorrhagia or postpartum hemorrhage, and large bruises (often described with lumps).

Defects of Platelet Aggregation

Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia (absence or dysfunction of platelet glycoprotein [Gp] IIb/IIIa)

Defects of Platelet Secretion

Drug-induced (aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, thienopyridines) Inherited

Nonspecific inherited secretory defects Nonspecific drug effects Uremia Platelet coating (e.g., paraprotein, penicillin)

Defect of Platelet Coagulant Activity

Easy bruising and menorrhagia are common complaints in patients with and without bleeding disorders. Easy bruising can also be a sign of medical conditions in which there is no identifiable coagulopathy; instead, the conditions are caused by an abnormality of blood vessels or their supporting tissues. In Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, there may be posttraumatic bleeding and a history of joint hyperextensibility. Cushing’s syndrome, chronic steroid use, and aging result in changes in skin and subcutaneous tissue, and subcutaneous bleeding occurs in response to minor trauma. The latter has been termed senile purpura.

learning to read single words that do not fully or rapidly remit with the provision of learning disorder. Evidence of persistent learning difficulties may be derived from cumulative school reports, portfolios of the child’s evaluated work, curriculum—based measures, or clinical interview. In adults, persistent difficulty refers to ongoing difficulties in literacy or numeracy skills that manifest during childhood or adolescence, as indicated by cumulative evidence from school reports, evaluated portfolios of work, or previous assessments.

The remaining children have more mixed temperaments. The individual temperament of a child has important implications for parenting and for the advice a pediatrician may give in anticipatory guidance or behavioral problem counseling.

Although, to some degree, temperament may be hardwired (nature) in each child, the environment (nurture) inwhich the child grows has a strong effect on the child’s adjustment. Social and cultural factors can have marked effects on the child through differences in parenting style, educational approaches, and behavioral expectations.

Developmental and behavioral problems are more common than any category of problems in pediatrics, except acute infections and trauma. In 2008 15% of children ages 3 to 7 had a developmental disability, and others had behavioral disabilities. As many as 25% of children have serious psychosocial problems. Parents often neglect to mention these problems because they think the physician is uninterested or cannot help. It is necessary to monitor development and screen for the presence of these problems at health supervision visits, particularly in the years before preschool or early childhood learning center enrollment.

Development surveillance, done at every office visit, is an informal process comparing skill levels to lists of milestones. If suspicion of developmental or behavioral issues recurs, further evaluation is warranted (Table 8-1). Surveillance does not have a standard, and screening tests are necessary.

Developmental screening involves the use of standardized screening tests to identify children who require further diagnostic assessment. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the use of validated standardized screening tools at three of the health maintenance visits: 9 months, 18 months, and 30 months. Clinics and offices that serve a higher risk patient population (children living in poverty) often perform a screening test at every health maintenance visit. A child who fails to pass a developmental screening test requires more comprehensive evaluation but does not necessarily have a delay; definitive testing must confirm. Developmental evaluations for children with suspected delays and intervention services for children with diagnosed disabilities are available free to families. A combination of U.S. state and federal funds provides these services.

This disorder, like dyslexia, usually becomes evident in the first few years of grade school, when the child is challenged by tasks of adding and subtracting and, later, multiplying and dividing. In some instances there is an evident disorder in the spatial arrangements of numbers that has been termed “anarithmetia” as noted in Chap. 21 (supposedly a right hemispheral fault). In others, there is a lexical–graphical abnormality (naming and reading the names of numbers) akin to aphasia.

Probably most of what has been said about the treatment of developmental dyslexia applies to acalculia and agraphia. The usual type of conventional classroom work does little to increase the child’s proficiency in writing and arithmetic, but special tutoring and drills aid the student to some extent. All of these impairments may be associated with hyperactivity and attentional defects, as described below (Denckla et al).

In direct contrast to the conditions discussed above, precocious reading and calculating abilities have also been identified. A 2or 3-year-old child may read with the skill of an average adult. Extraordinary facility with numbers (mathematical prodigies) and memorization ability (eidetic imagery) are comparable traits. One of these special abilities may be observed in a child with a mild form of autism (Asperger syndrome, see Chap. 37). Such children exhibit great skill in performing particular mathematical tricks but are unable to solve simple arithmetical problems or to understand the meaning of numbers (“savant syndrome”). In the child with Williams syndrome, language and sometimes musical skills are not so much precocious as relatively normal in comparison to the overall mental deficiency, indicating that not all forms of cognitive delay impair language skills.

Once the child is in school, the attention deficit becomes a more troubling, practical problem. Now these children must sit still, watch and listen to the teacher when she speaks to another child, and not react to distracting stimuli. They cannot stay at their desks, take turns in reciting, be quiet, or control their impulsivity. The teacher finds it difficult to discipline them and the school often insists that the parents seek medical consultation for the child. A few are so hyperactive that they cannot attend regular classes. Their behavior verges on the “organic drivenness” that has been known to occur in children whose brains have been injured by encephalitis. In certain families, the disorder is probably inherited (Biederman et al). In about half the hyperactivity subsides gradually by puberty or soon thereafter, but in the remainder the symptoms persist in modified form into adulthood (Weiss et al).

It has also become clear that there is a large group of children who have difficulty sustaining concentration but do not manifest hyperactivity or behaviors that betray the attention deficit. It is presumed that they share a similar core problem with hyperkinetic children, and it has been observed that they may be helped in studying and school performance by the same stimulant drugs that are used for the treatment of more overt ADHD. A precise relationship between motor hyperactivity and the inability to concentrate and stay focused on a series of tasks has not been established. It would seem that these are but two aspects of the same fundamental disorder of drive and attention, but it is clear that there are individuals who have difficulty concentrating but who are not manifestly hyperactive. This becomes a particular issue in adults with ostensible ADHD who feel they have always had trouble focusing as discussed further on.

as a range of observable, descriptive behaviors or symptoms (as listed in Criteria A1—A6). These clinical symptoms may be observed, probed by means of the clinical interview, or ascertained from school reports, rat- ing scales, or descriptions in previous educational or psychological assessments. The learning difficulties are persistent, not transitory. In children and adolescents, persistence is defined as restricted progress in learning (i.e., no evidence that the individual is catching up with class- mates) for at least 6 months despite the provision of extra help at home or school. For example, difficulties learning to read single

in the treatment of dyspnea. If the patient has a history of COPD or asthma, inhaled bronchodilators and glucocorticoids may be helpful. If the patient has pulmonary edema due to heart failure, diuresis with a medication such as furosemide is indicated. Excess secretions can be dried with scopolamine, transdermally or intravenously.

Pulmonary edema is most commonly due to heart failure from left ventricular or biventricular dysfunction. Pulmonary hypertension and associated cor pulmonale (rightventricular dysfunction) do not usually cause pulmonaryedema as the increased vascular resistance is proximal tothe capillary bed. Increased capillary permeability, seen indisease states such as sepsis and acute respiratory distresssyndrome, can lead to pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edemamay also occur with excessive swings in intrathoracic pressure, as seen after tracheal foreign body aspiration or severeobstruction from hypertrophied tonsils and adenoids (postobstructive pulmonary edema). Pulmonary edema mayalso be present in conditions with decreased serum oncotic pressure (hypoalbuminemia); after administration of largevolumes of intravenous (IV) fluids, especially if there iscapillary injury; with ascent to high altitude (high altitude pulmonary edema); and after central nervous system injury (neurogenic pulmonary edema).

The clinical manifestations of pulmonary edema are dyspnea, tachypnea, and cough (often with frothy, pink-tinged sputum). As the edema worsens, there is increased work of breathing and hypoxemia; diffuse inspiratory crackles can be heard on auscultation.

Chest radiographs may reveal diffuse hazy infiltrates, classically in a perihilar pattern, but these findings may be obscured by underlying lung disease. Interstitial edema (Kerley B lines)may be seen, especially at the lung bases.

Treatment and prognosis depend on the cause of the pulmonary edema and response to therapy. Patients should be positioned in an upright posture and given supplemental O2. Diuretic therapy and rapidly acting IV inotropic agents may be helpful in cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or intubation with positive pressure ventilation using high positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEP) may be required.

SEE CHAPTER 39.

Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension develops in 2–4% of acute PE patients. Therefore, PE patients who have initial pulmonary hypertension (usually diagnosed with Doppler echocardiography) should be followed up at about 6 weeks with a repeat echocardiogram to determine whether pulmonary arterial pressure has normalized. Patients impaired by dyspnea due to chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension should be considered for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy, which, if successful, can markedly reduce, and sometimes even cure, pulmonary hypertension (Chap. 304). The operation requires median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass, deep hypothermia, and periods of hypothermic circulatory arrest. The mortality rate at experienced centers is approximately 5%. Inoperable patients should be managed with pulmonary vasodilator therapy.

Patients with VTE may feel overwhelmed when they learn that they are suffering from PE or DVT. Some have never previously encountered serious cardiovascular illness. They wonder whether they will be able to adapt to the new limitations imposed by anticoagulation. They worry about the health of their families and the genetic implications of their illness. Those who are advised to discontinue anticoagulation may feel especially vulnerable about the potential for suffering recurrent VTE. At Brigham and Woman’s Hospital, a physician-nurse–facilitated PE support group was initiated to address these concerns and has met monthly for more than 20 years.

are titrated to achieve a heart rate of 60 to 80 bpm. In patients who cannot receive b-antagonists, calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem are an effective alternative. Nitroprusside, a direct vasodilator, can be administered once b-blockade is adequate. When used alone, however, nitroprusside can cause reflex increases in heart rate and contractility, elevated dP/dT, and pro-gression of aortic dissection. Enalapril and other angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are useful in patients with renal malperfusion. These drugs inhibit renin release, which may improve renal blood flow.Treatment of Ascending Aortic Dissection Acute

InterventIons When reversible or treatable etiologies are diagnosed, they should be treated as long as the side effects of treatment, such as repeated drainage of effusions or anticoagulants, are less burdensome than the dyspnea itself. More aggressive treatments such as stenting a bronchial lesion may be warranted if it is clear that the dyspnea is due to tumor invasion at that site and if the patient and family understand the risks of such a procedure. Usually, treatment will be symptomatic (Table 10-6). A dyspnea scale and careful monitoring should guide dose adjustment. Low-dose

If patients are not receiving opioids, weak opioids can be initiated; if patients are already receiving opioids, morphine or other strong opioids should be used. Controlled trials do not support the use of nebulized opioids for dyspnea at the end of life. Phenothiazines and chlorpromazine may be helpful when combined with opioids. Benzodiazepines can be helpful if anxiety is present but should be neither used as first-line therapy nor used alone in the treatment of

The respiratory system can be divided into two components: the lungs and the chest wall. Normally, respiratory system compliance is ~100 mL/cmH2O. Pathophysiologic processes such as pleural effusions, pneumothorax, and increased abdominal girth all reduce chest wall compliance. Lung compliance may be reduced by pneumonia, pulmonary edema, interstitial lung disease, or auto-PEEP. Accordingly, patients with abnormalities in compliance of the respiratory system (lungs and/or chest wall) typically have elevated peak and plateau airway pressures but a normal gradient between these two pressures. Auto-PEEP occurs when there is insufficient time for emptying of alveoli before the next inspiratory cycle. Since the alveoli have not decompressed completely, alveolar pressure remains positive at the end of exhalation (functional residual capacity). This phenomenon results most commonly from critical narrowing of distal airways in disease processes such as asthma and COPD. Auto-PEEP with resulting alveolar overdistention may result in diminished lung compliance, reflected by abnormally increased plateau airway pressures. Modern mechanical ventilators allow breath-to-breath display of pressure and flow, permitting detection of problems such as patient-ventilator dyssynchrony, airflow obstruction, and auto-PEEP (Fig. 321–6).

Oxygen delivery (QO2) is a function of cardiac output and the content of O2 in the arterial blood (CaO2). The CaO2 is determined by the hemoglobin concentration, the arterial hemoglobin saturation, and dissolved O2 not bound to hemoglobin. For normal adults:

QO2 = 50 dL/min × (1.39 × 15 g/dL [hemoglobin concentration] × 1.0 [hemoglobin % saturation] + 0.0031 × 100 [PaO2]) = 50 dL/min (cardiac output) × 21.6 mL O2 per dL blood (CaO2)

Minute ventilation Total volume of gas entering lungs per minute Normal values: VE = VT × RR Respiratory rate (RR) = 12–20 breaths/min

Alveolar ventilation Volume of gas that reaches alveoli each minute T V = 150 mL/breath

Elastic recoil Tendency for lungs to collapse inward and chest wall to spring outward.

At FRC, airway and alveolar pressures equal atmospheric pressure (called zero), and intrapleural pressure is negative (preventing atelectasis). The inward pull of the lung is balanced by the outward pull of the chest wall. System pressure is atmospheric. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is at a minimum.

Compliance Change in lung volume for a change in pressure (ΔV/ΔP). Inversely proportional to wall stiffness and increased by surfactant. 6 •  compliance = lung easier to fill (eg, emphysema, aging) •  compliance = lung harder to fill (eg, 4 pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonia, ARDS, pulmonary edema)

Hysteresis Lung inflation follows a different pressure-2 volume curve than lung deflation due to need to overcome surface tension forces in inflation.

Hemoglobin Oxygen content of blood

O2 content = (1.34 × Hb × Sao2) + (0.003 × Pao2) Hb = hemoglobin concentration; Sao2 = arterial O2 saturation Pao2 = partial pressure of O2 in arterial blood

Normally 1 g Hb can bind 1.34 mL O2; normal Hb amount in blood is 15 g/dL. O2 binding capacity ≈ 20 mL O2/dL of blood. With  Hb there is  O2 content of arterial blood, but no change in O2 saturation and Pao2. O2 delivery to tissues = cardiac output × O2 content of blood.

ODC has sigmoidal shape due to positive cooperativity (ie, tetrameric Hb molecule can 100 bind 4 O2 molecules and has higher affinity for each subsequent O2 molecule bound). 80 Myoglobin is monomeric and thus does 70 not show positive cooperativity; curve lacks 60 sigmoidal appearance.

The woman who aspirates may develop evidence of respiratory distress immediately or several hours after aspiration, depending in part on the material aspirated and the severity of the response. Aspiration of a large amount of solid material causes obvious airway obstruction. Smaller particles without acidic liquid may lead to patchy atelectasis and later to bronchopneumonia.

When highly acidic liquid is inspired, decreased oxygen saturation along with tachypnea, bronchospasm, rhonchi, rales, atelectasis, cyanosis, tachycardia, and hypotension are likely to develop. At the injury sites, there is pulmonary capillary leakage and exudation of protein-rich fluid containing numerous erythrocytes into the lung interstitium and alveoli. his causes decreased pulmonary compliance, shunting of blood, and severe hypoxemia. Radiographic changes may not appear immediately, and these may be variable, although the right lung most often is afected. hus, chest radiographs alone should not be used to exclude aspiration.

he methods recommended for treatment of aspiration have changed appreciably in recent years, indicating that previous therapy was not very successful. Suspicion of aspiration of gastric contents demands close monitoring for evidence of pulmonary damage. Respiratory rate and oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry are the most sensitive and earliest indicators of injury.

Inhaled luid should be immediately and thoroughly wiped from the mouth and removed from the pharynx and trachea by suction. Saline lavage may further disseminate the acid throughout the lung and is not recommended. If large particulate matter is inspired, bronchoscopy may be indicated to relieve airway obstruction. No convincing evidence supports that corticosteroid therapy or prophylactic antimicrobial administration is beneicial (Marik, 2001). If infection develops, however, then vigorous treatment is given. If acute respiratory failure develops, mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure may be lifesaving (Chap. 47, p. 919).

hypertrophy of the pulmonary arterioles and fluid in the fetallung increases resistance to blood flow. Pulmonary artery tonealso responds to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acidosis with vasoconstriction, a response that may increase pulmonary vascularresistance further. The ductus arteriosus remains patent in thefetus because of low Pao2 levels and dilating prostaglandins. Inutero, the right ventricle is the dominant ventricle, pumping65% of the combined ventricular output, which is a high volume (450 mL/kg/min) compared with that pumped by an olderinfant’s right ventricle (200 mL/kg/min).

The transition of the circulation, occurring between the fetal and neonatal periods, involves the removal of the low-resistance circulation of the placenta, the onset of breathing, reduction of pulmonary arterial resistance, and closure of in utero shunts. Clamping the umbilical cord eliminates the low-pressure system of the placenta and increases systemic blood pressure. Decreased venous return from the placenta decreases right atrial pressure. As breathing begins, air replaces lung fluid, maintaining the functional residual capacity. Fluid leaves the lung, in part, through the trachea; it is either swallowed or squeezed out during vaginal delivery. The pulmonary lymphatic and venous systems reabsorb the remaining fluid.

The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly.

The plasma Na+ concentration on admission was 113 meq/L, with a creatinine of 2.35 (Table 64e-1). At hospital hour 7, the plasma Na+ concentration was 120 meq/L, potassium 5.4 meq/L, chloride 90 64e-5 meq/L, bicarbonate 22 meq/L, BUN 32 mg/dL, creatinine 2.02 mg/dL, glucose 89 mg/dL, total protein 5.0, and albumin 1.9. The hematocrit was 33.9, white count 7.6, and platelets 405. A morning cortisol was 19.5, with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of 1.7. The patient was treated with 1 μg of intravenous DDAVP, along with 75 mL/h of intravenous half-normal saline. After the plasma Na+ concentration dropped to 116 meq/L, intravenous fluid was switched to normal saline at the same infusion rate. The subsequent results are shown in Table 64e-1.

This patient presented with hypovolemic hyponatremia and a “prerenal” reduction in GFR, with an increase in serum creatinine. She had experienced diarrhea for some time and manifested an orthostatic tachycardia after a liter of normal saline. As expected for hypovolemic hyponatremia, the urine Na+ concentration was <20 meq/L in the absence of congestive heart failure or other causes of hypervolemic hyponatremia, and she responded to saline hydration with an increase in plasma Na+ concentration and a decrease in creatinine.

A 32-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with weakness and hypokalemia. The patient had been very healthy until 2 months previously when he developed intermittent leg weakness. His review of systems was otherwise negative. He denied drug or laxative abuse and was on no medications. Past medical history was unremarkable, with no history of neuromuscular disease. Family history was notable for a sister with thyroid disease. Physical examination was notable only for reduced deep tendon reflexes.

This patient developed hypokalemia due to a redistribution of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular compartments; this pathophysiology was readily apparent following calculation of the TTKG. The TTKG is calculated as (P × U )/(P ×

U ). The expected values for the TTKG are <3 in the presence of hypokalemia and >7–8 in the presence of hyperkalemia (see also Case 2 and Case 8). Alternatively, a urinary K+-to-creatinine ratio of >13 mmol/g creatinine (>1.5 mmol/mmol creatinine) is compatible with excessive renal K+ excretion. In this case, the calculated TTKG was 2.5, consistent with appropriate renal conservation of K+ and a nonrenal cause for hypokalemia. In the absence of significant gastrointestinal loss of K+, the patient was diagnosed with a “redistributive” subtype of hypokalemia.

Hemodialysis is the most effective and reliable method to reduce plasma K+ concentration; peritoneal dialysis is considerably less effective. Patients with acute kidney injury require temporary, urgent venous access for hemodialysis, with the attendant risks; in contrast, patients with ESRD or advanced chronic kidney disease may have a preexisting venous access. The amount of K+ removed during hemodialysis depends on the relative distribution of K+ between ICF and ECF (potentially affected by prior therapy for hyperkalemia), the type and surface area of the dialyzer used, dialysate and blood flow rates, dialysate flow rate, dialysis duration, and the plasma-to-dialysate K+ gradient.

A 23-year-old woman was admitted with a 3-day history of fever, cough productive of blood-tinged sputum, confusion, and orthostasis. Past medical history included type 1 diabetes mellitus. A physical examination in the emergency department indicated postural hypo-tension, tachycardia, and Kussmaul respiration. The breath was noted to smell of “acetone.” Examination of the thorax suggested consolidation in the right lower lobe.

The diagnosis of the acid-base disorder should proceed in a stepwise fashion: 1.

The normal anion gap (AG) is 8–10 meq/L, but in this case, the AG is elevated (20 meq/L). Therefore, the change in AG (ΔAG) = ~10 meq/L.

respectively. Some centers have adopted more sensitive criteria, using values of <5.3 mmol/L (<95 mg/dL), <10 mmol/L (<180 mg/dL), <8.6 mmol/L (<155 mg/dL), and <7.8 mmol/L (<140 mg/dL) as the upper norms for a 3-h glucose tolerance test. Two elevated glucose values indicate a positive test. Adverse pregnancy outcomes for mother and fetus appear to increase with glucose as a continuous variable; thus it is challenging to define the optimal threshold for establishing the diagnosis of gestational diabetes.

Plasma glucose >7.8 mmol/L (>130 mg/dL) warrants administration of a 100-g oral glucose challenge with plasma glucose measurements obtained in the fasting state and at 1, 2, and 3 h. Normal plasma glucose concentrations at these time points are <5.8 mmol/L (<105 mg/dL), 10.5 mmol/L (190 mg/dL), 9.1 mmol/L (165 mg/dL), and 8.0 mmol/L (145 mg/dL), respectively. Some centers

Gestational diabetes occurs in approximately 4% of pregnancies. All pregnant women should be screened for gestational diabetes unless they are in a low-risk group. Women at low risk for gestational diabetes are those <25 years of age; those with a body mass index <25 kg/m2, no maternal history of macrosomia or gestational diabetes, and no diabetes in a first-degree relative; and those who are not members of a high-risk ethnic group (African American, Hispanic, Native American). A typical two-step strategy for establishing the diagnosis of gestational diabetes involves administration of a 50-g oral glucose

with the diagnosis of gastro-esophageal reflux. Patients presenting with the typical symp-toms of heartburn and/or regurgitation which have responded, at least partly, to PPI therapy, will generally do well following surgery, whereas patients with atypical symptoms have a less predictable response. Reflux should also be objectively con-firmed by either the presence of ulcerative esophagitis or an abnormal 24-hour pH study.The propulsive force of the body of the esophagus should be evaluated by esophageal manometry to determine if it has sufficient power to propel a bolus of food through a newly reconstructed valve.

document (1) 

When classic symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux are present, such as water brash and substernal heartburn, presumptive diagnosis and empirical treatment are often sufficient. Endoscopy is a sensitive test for diagnosis of esophagitis (Fig. 345-38), but will miss nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) because some patients have symptomatic reflux without esophagitis. The most sensitive test for diagnosis of GERD is 24-h ambulatory pH monitoring. Endoscopy is indicated in patients with reflux symptoms refractory to antisecretory therapy; in those with alarm symptoms, such as dysphagia, weight loss, or gastrointestinal bleeding; and in those with recurrent dyspepsia after treatment that is not clearly due to reflux on clinical grounds alone. Endoscopy should be considered in patients with long-standing (≥10 years) GERD, because they have a sixfold increased risk of harboring Barrett’s esophagus compared to a patient with <1 year of reflux symptoms. Patients with Barrett’s esophagus (Fig. 345-3) generally undergo a surveillance program of periodic endoscopy with biopsies to detect dysplasia or early carcinoma.

Barrett’s Esophagus Barrett’s esophagus is specialized columnar metaplasia that replaces the normal squamous mucosa of the distal esophagus in some persons with GERD. Barrett’s epithelium is a major risk factor for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and is readily detected endoscopically, due to proximal displacement of the squamocolumnar junction (Fig. 345-3). A screening EGD for Barrett’s esophagus should be considered in patients with a chronic (≥10 year) history of GERD symptoms. Endoscopic biopsy is the gold standard for confirmation of Barrett’s esophagus and for dysplasia or cancer arising in Barrett’s mucosa.

by the ease of passing a standard endo-scope. When a stricture is observed, the severity of the esopha-gitis above it should be recorded. The absence of esophagitis above a stricture suggests the possibility of a chemical-induced injury or a neoplasm as a cause. The latter should always be considered and is ruled out only by evaluation of a tissue biopsy of adequate size. It should be remembered that gastroesophageal reflux is not always associated with visible mucosal abnormali-ties, and patients can experience significant reflux symptoms, despite an apparently normal endoscopy examination.Barrett’s esophagus

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) occurs when GERleads to troublesome symptoms or complications such as poorgrowth, pain, or breathing difficulties. GERD occurs in a minorityof infants but is often implicated as the cause of fussiness. GERDis seen in fewer than 5% of older children. In older children, normal protective mechanisms against GER include antegradeesophageal motility, tonic contraction of the LES, and the geometry of the gastroesophageal junction. Abnormalities that causeGER in older children and adults include reduced tone of the LES, transient relaxations of the LES, esophagitis (which impairsesophageal motility), increased intra-abdominal pressure, cough,respiratory difficulty (asthma or cystic fibrosis), and hiatal hernia.

Cough Hoarseness Wheezing Abdominal Pain Failure to Thrive

The presence of GER is easy to observe in an infant who spits up. In older children, the refluxate is usually kept down by reswallowing, but GER may be suspected by associated symptoms, such as heartburn, cough, epigastric abdominal pain, dysphagia, wheezing, aspiration pneumonia, hoarse voice, failure to thrive, and recurrent otitis media or sinusitis. In severe cases of esophagitis, there may be laboratory evidence of anemia and hypoalbuminemia secondary to esophageal bleeding and inflammation.

When esophagitis develops as a result of acid reflux, esophageal motility and LES function are impaired further, creating a cycle of reflux and esophageal injury.

Adolescent Patients A pelvic examination may be less revealing in an adolescent than in an older woman, particularly if it is the patient’s first examination or if it takes place on an emergency basis. An adolescent who presents with excessive bleeding should have a pelvic examination if she had intercourse, if the results of a pregnancy test are positive, if she has abdominal pain, if she is markedly anemic, or if she is bleeding heavily enough to compromise hemodynamic stability. The pelvic examination occasionally may be deferred in young teenagers who have a classic history of irregular cycles soon after menarche, who have normal hematocrit levels, who deny sexual activity, and who will reliably return for follow-up. A pelvic examination may be deferred in adolescents who present to the office requesting oral contraceptives before the initiation of intercourse or at the patient’s request, even if she has had intercourse. Newer testing methods using DNA amplification techniques allow noninvasive urine testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia (57). Current guidelines recommend that cervical cytology testing in most adolescents be initiated at age 21 (58).

Other diagnostic techniques (such as pelvic ultrasound) can substitute for or supplement an inadequate examination. An examination usually is required when there is a question of pelvic pain, genital anomaly, pregnancy-related condition, or possibility of pelvic infection. The keys to a successful examination in an adolescent lie in earning the patient’s trust, explaining the components of her examination, performing only the essential components, and using a very careful and gentle technique. It is helpful to ascertain whether the patient had a previous pelvic examination, how she perceived the experience, and what she heard about a pelvic examination from her mother or friends.

Childhood Sexual Abuse Childhood sexual abuse has a profound and potentially lifelong effect on the survivor. Although most cases of childhood sexual abuse are not reported by the survivor or her family, it is estimated that as many as one-third of adult women were sexually abused as children. Childhood sexual abuse is often accompanied by another type of household dysfunction, such as physical abuse, violence against other family members, or substance abuse by parental figures (114). Younger children are more often exposed to genital fondling or noncontact abuse (exhibitionism, forced observation of masturbation, or posing in child pornography), and children older than 10 years of age are more likely to be forced to have intercourse or oral sex (119). As children age, they are more likely to experience sexual abuse outside the home and more likely to be victimized by strangers. As adolescents, women survivors of childhood sexual abuse are at risk for early unplanned pregnancy, STDs, prostitution, further sexual abuse (revictimization), antisocial behavior, running away from home, lying, stealing, eating disorders and obesity, and multiple somatic symptoms (120). These women are more likely to engage in health risk behaviors such as smoking, substance abuse, and early sexual activity with multiple partners (121). They may be less likely to use contraception (122). Survivors often avoid pelvic examinations and are less likely to have Papanicolaou (Pap) tests because of the association between vaginal examinations and pain (125). They often receive inadequate prenatal care and are more likely than women who were not abused to experience suicidal ideation and depression during their pregnancies and to deliver smaller and less mature babies (114).

Obstetrician–gynecologists can assist their sexual assault patients by validating their feelings and concerns and giving them control over their examination. It is important to ask the patient for permission to perform the examination, give her the opportunity to have an advocate in the room with her, and let her know that she has the right to stop the examination at any time (114).

Although the term “vaginismus” is often loosely used to refer to reﬂex tightening secondary to dyspareunia (e.g., from PVD or vaginal atrophy), strictly speaking, the term should only be used when no such pathology is present. Thus, the diagnosis of vaginismus is provisional until a very careful introital and vaginal examination can be done. This is not possible until the woman learns to be able to abduct her thighs, open the labia with her fingers or permit the examiner to do so, and to tolerate introital touch. The therapy for vaginismus must begin before the diagnosis is confirmed: 1.

Encourage the couple to engage in sexual activities that exclude any attempt at intercourse. They may need to have “dates” and deliberately provide sexual contexts.

2.

Explain to the patient the reﬂex contraction of pelvic muscles around the vagina to touch, especially when touch was associated only with negative emotions and physical pain. These women rarely use tampons and avoid the introitus and vagina in sexual play and have not experienced any neutral or positive sensations from this area of their bodies.

3.

Institute self-touch on a daily basis for a few minutes as close to the vaginal opening as possible. This may be done while the woman is in the bathtub or relaxing by herself on the bed. This is not sexual, and at first it will be highly anxiety provoking. Providing she does this daily, the anxiety will quickly decrease.

4.

Suggest adding visual imagery to the previous exercise so that she imagines being able to have a limited vaginal examination, sitting up on the examination couch at about a 70-degree angle to, with the aid of a mirror, view the vaginal opening and separate her labia, and be in control of what happens.

5. As soon as she is ready, perform the partial vulvovaginal examination as in step 4. If possible, encourage her to touch the vagina, moving her finger past the hymen, possibly afterward doing the same with the physician’s gloved finger.

Pokorny and Stormer described a technique for obtaining vaginal cultures and for performing vaginal irrigation (50). A catheter within a catheter can be fashioned using the tubing from an intravenous butterﬂy setup within a sterile urethral catheter. Nonbacteriostatic saline (1–3 mL) can be injected, aspirated, and sent for culture (Fig. 14.11). Cultures taken in this manner are almost always better tolerated than cultures obtained using a cotton-tipped applicator. A larger quantity of saline can be used to irrigate the vagina while the catheter is still within the vagina. Small foreign bodies can often be ﬂushed from the vagina in this manner. The most common foreign body is a small piece of toilet paper, although children will place other objects (toys, beans, coins) within their vaginas (Fig. 14.5). A persistent vaginal discharge after treatment or a discharge that is bloody or brown in color without other obvious external lesions should prompt vaginal irrigation or vaginoscopy to rule out a foreign body (12).

The adolescent’s experience and expression of illness and pain should be viewed within the context of her life experiences. Most adolescents have limited life experiences with problems such as pain, discomfort, or bleeding. An adolescent may state that she is experiencing the “worst pain of her life” and yet may appear to be reasonably comfortable. She may well be stating the truth about this experience, which the clinician must still interpret differently from the symptoms of an adult woman who, for instance, may be in active labor. It should be remembered that an individual’s response to illness and pain is to some extent a learned behavior.

Anteroposterior and frog-leg radiographs of the hip are usually normal. Ultrasonography may reveal a joint effusion. It is mandatory to rule out septic arthritis in the presence of effusion with a joint aspiration and cell count.

The mainstay of treatment is bed rest and minimal weight bearing until the pain resolves. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication is usually sufficient to decrease pain. Limiting strenuous activity and exercise for 1 to 2 weeks following recovery is helpful. Follow-up will help ensure that there is no deterioration. Lack of improvement necessitates further evaluation for more serious disorders.

Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCPD) is idiopathic avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis) of the capital epiphysis of the femoral head. The etiology is unclear, but it is likely caused by an interruption of the blood supply to the capital femoral epiphysis. There may be an associated hypercoagulability state (factor V Leiden).

LCPD commonly presents in patients 3 to 12 years of age, with a mean age of 7 years. It is four to five times more common in boys.

Patients may not present for several weeks because of minimaldiscomfort; the classic presentation is a child with an atraumatic, painless limp. There may be mild or intermittent hip/groin, anterior thigh, or knee pain. Decreased internal rotationand abduction with some discomfort, thigh muscle spasm, andanterior thigh muscular atrophy may be present. Patients havedelayed bone age.

Above 42°C (107.6° F), heat can rapidly produce direct cellular injury. Thermosensitive enzymes become nonfunctional, and eventually there is irreversible uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. The production of heat-shock proteins increases, and cytokines mediate a systemic inflammatory response. The vascular endothelium is also damaged, and this injury activates the coagulation cascade. Significant shunting away from the splanchnic circulation produces gastrointestinal ischemia. Endotoxins further impair normal thermoregulation. As a result, if cooling is delayed, severe hepatic dysfunction, permanent renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and fulminant multisystem organ failure may occur.

Before cooling is initiated, endotracheal intubation, CVP determination, and continuous core-temperature monitoring should be considered. Hypoglycemia is a frequent finding and can be addressed by glucose infusion. Since peripheral vasoconstriction delays heat dissipation, repeated administration of discrete boluses of isotonic crystalloid for hypotension is preferable to the administration of α-adrenergic agonists.

Evaporative cooling is usually the most practical and effective technique. Rapid cooling is essential in both CHS and EHS, and an immediate improvement in vital signs and mental status may prove valuable for diagnostic purposes. Cool water (15°C [60° F]) is sprayed on the exposed skin while fans direct continuous airflow over the moistened skin. Cold packs applied to the axillae and groin are a useful cooling adjunct. If cardiac electrodes will not adhere, they can be applied to the patient's back. To avoid “overshoot hypothermia,” active cooling should be terminated at ~38°–39°C (100.4°–102.2°F).

Immersion cooling in cold water is an alternative option in EHS but induces peripheral vasoconstriction and intense shivering. This technique presents significant monitoring and resuscitation challenges in most clinical settings. The safety of immersion cooling is best established for young, previously healthy patients with EHS (but not for those with CHS).

This type of inflammatory disease of cranial arteries is an important cause of headache in older persons. All of our patients have been older than 55 years of age, most of them older than age 65. From a state of normal health, the patient develops an increasingly intense throbbing or nonthrobbing headache, often with superimposed sharp, stabbing pains. In a few patients the headache has had an almost explosive onset. The pain is usually unilateral, sometimes bilateral, and often localized to the site of the affected arteries in the scalp. The pain persists to some degree throughout the day and is particularly severe at night. It lasts for many months if untreated. The superficial temporal and other scalp arteries are frequently thickened and tender and without pulsation. Jaw claudication and ischemic nodules on the scalp, with ulceration of the overlying skin, have been described in severe cases.

Many of the patients feel generally unwell and have lost weight; some have a low-grade fever and anemia. Usually the sedimentation rate is greatly elevated (>50 mm/h and typically >75 mm/h) but elevation of the C-reactive protein (CRP) level is a more sensitive indicator of this inflammatory condition and is particularly helpful when the sedimentation rate is only mildly elevated. A few patients have a peripheral neutrophilic leukocytosis. Half of patients have generalized aching of proximal limb muscles, reflecting the presence of polymyalgia rheumatica (see Chap. 45, “Polymyalgia Rheumatica”). A relation of temporal arteritis to herpes zoster has been proposed.

The importance of early diagnosis relates to the threat of blindness from thrombosis of the ophthalmic or posterior ciliary arteries. This may be preceded by several episodes of amaurosis fugax (transient monocular blindness). Ophthalmoplegia may also occur but is less frequent, and its cause, whether neural or muscular, is not settled.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Early Infection: Stage 1 (Localized Infection) Because of the small size of nymphal ixodid ticks, most patients do not remember the preceding tick bite. After an incubation period of 3–32 days, EM usually begins as a red macule or papule at the site of the tick bite that expands slowly to form a large annular lesion (Fig. 210-1). As the lesion increases in size, it often develops a bright red outer border and partial central clearing. The center of the lesion sometimes becomes intensely erythematous and indurated, vesicular, or necrotic. In other instances, the expanding lesion remains an even, intense red; several red rings are found within an outside ring; or the central area turns blue before the lesion clears. Although EM can be located anywhere, the thigh, groin, and axilla are particularly common sites. The lesion is warm but not often painful. Approximately 20% of patients do not exhibit this characteristic skin manifestation.

FIGuRE 210-1 A classic erythema migrans lesion (9 cm in diameter) is shown near the right axilla. The lesion has partial central clearing, a bright red outer border, and a target center. (Courtesy of Vijay K. Sikand, MD; with permission.)

Early Infection: Stage 2 (Disseminated Infection) In cases in the United States, B. burgdorferi often spreads hematogenously to many sites within days or weeks after the onset of EM. In these cases, patients may develop secondary annular skin lesions similar in appearance to the initial lesion. Skin involvement is commonly accompanied by severe headache, mild stiffness of the neck, fever, chills, migratory musculoskeletal pain, arthralgias, and profound malaise and fatigue. Less common manifestations include generalized lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, hepatitis, sore throat, nonproductive cough, conjunctivitis, iritis, or testicular swelling. Except for fatigue and lethargy, which are often constant, the early signs and symptoms of Lyme disease are typically intermittent and changing. Even in untreated patients, the early symptoms usually become less severe or disappear within several weeks. In ~15% of patients, the infection presents with these nonspecific systemic symptoms.

This is of real concern since 40% of individuals age 65 years and older are taking five or more medications prescribed by more than one doctor.45 Additionally, 68% of older adults use over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, or both concurrently with prescription medications.46 Of note, polypharmacy has been associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment, morbidity, and mortality, and the risk of adverse

Once the presence of hypertension is established, the question of whether to treat and which drugs to use must be considered. The level of blood pressure, the age of the patient, the severity of organ damage (if any) due to high blood pressure, and the presence of cardiovascular risk factors all must be considered. Assessment of renal function and the presence of proteinuria are useful in antihypertensive drug selection. Treatment thresholds and goals are described in Table 11–1. At this stage, the patient must be educated about the nature of hypertension and the importance of treatment so that he or she can make an informed decision regarding therapy.

Once the decision is made to treat, a therapeutic regimen must be developed. Selection of drugs is dictated by the level of blood pressure, the presence and severity of end-organ damage, and the presence of other diseases. Severe high blood pressure with life-threatening complications requires more rapid treatment with more efficacious drugs. Most patients with essential hypertension, however, have had elevated blood pressure for months or years, and therapy is best initiated in a gradual fashion.

Education about the natural history of hypertension and the importance of treatment adherence as well as potential adverse effects of drugs is essential. Obesity should be treated and drugs that increase blood pressure (sympathomimetic decongestants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral contraceptives, and some herbal medications) should be eliminated if possible. Follow-up visits should be frequent enough to convince the patient that the physician thinks the illness is serious. With each follow-up visit, the importance of treatment should be reinforced and questions concerning dosing or side effects of medication encouraged. Other factors that may improve compliance are simplifying dosing regimens and having the patient monitor blood pressure at home.

An urgent surgical procedure was performed.

Burr holes were placed around the region of the hematoma and it was evacuated. The small branch of the middle meningeal artery was ligated and the patient spent a few days in the intensive care unit. Fortunately the patient made an uneventful recovery.

A 35-year-old man was involved in a fight and sustained a punch to the right orbit. He came to the emergency department with double vision.

The double vision was only in one plane.

Examination of the orbits revealed that when the patient was asked to look upward the right eye was unable to move superiorly when adducted. There was some limitation in general eye movement. Assessment of the lateral rectus muscle (abducent nerve [VI]), superior oblique muscle (trochlear nerve [IV]), and the rest of the eye muscles (oculomotor nerve [III]) was otherwise unremarkable.

The patient underwent a CT scan.

A CT scan of the facial bones demonstrated a fracture through the floor of the orbit (Fig. 8.293).

A careful review of this CT scan demonstrated that the inferior oblique muscle had been pulled inferiorly with the fragment of bone in the fracture. This produced a tethering effect, so when the patient was asked to gaze in the upward direction, the left eye was able to do so but the right eye was unable to because of the tethered inferior oblique muscle.

The patient underwent surgical exploration to elevate the small bony fragment and return the inferior oblique to its appropriate position. On follow-up the patient had no complications.

A 25-year-old man complained of significant swelling in front of his right ear before and around mealtimes. This swelling was associated with considerable pain, which was provoked by the ingestion of lemon sweets. On examination he had tenderness around the right parotid region and a hard nodule was demonstrated in the buccal mucosa adjacent to the right upper molar teeth.

A diagnosis of parotid duct calculus was made.

A neck radiograph and coronal CT image of the neck demonstrates a cervical rib (eFig. 3.116).

Cervical ribs may produce three distinct disease entities:

Arterial compression and embolization—the cervical rib (or band) on the undersurface of the distal portion of the subclavian artery reduces the diameter of the vessel and allows eddy currents to form. Platelets aggregate and atheroma may develop in this region. This debris can be dislodged and flow distally within the upper limb vessels to block off blood flow to the fingers and the hand, a condition called distal embolization.

Tension on the T1 nerve—the T1 nerve, which normally passes over rib I, is also elevated by the presence of a cervical rib; thus the patient may experience a sensory disturbance over the medial aspect of the forearm, and develop wasting of the intrinsic muscles of the hand.

Compression of the subclavian vein—this may induce axillary vein thrombosis.

A Doppler ultrasound scan revealed marked stenosis of the subclavian artery at the outer border of the rib with abnormal flow distal to the narrowing. Within this region of abnormal flow there was evidence of thrombus adherent to the vessel wall.

This patient underwent surgical excision of the cervical rib and had no further symptoms.

A 52-year-old man presented with headaches and shortness of breath. He also complained of coughing up small volumes of blood. Clinical examination revealed multiple dilated veins around the neck. A chest radiograph demonstrated an elevated diaphragm on the right and a tumor mass, which was believed to be a primary bronchogenic carcinoma.

By observing the clinical findings and applying anatomical knowledge, the site of the tumor can be inferred.

The multiple dilated veins around the neck are indicative of venous obstruction. The veins are dilated on both sides of the neck, implying that the obstruction must be within a common vessel, the superior vena cava. Anterior to the superior vena cava in the right side of the chest is the phrenic nerve, which supplies the diaphragm. Because the diaphragm is elevated, suggesting paralysis, it is clear that the phrenic nerve has been involved with the tumor.

The swollen legs were accounted for by caval obstruction.

The tumor grew along the renal vein and into the inferior vena cava toward the heart. Renal tumors can grow rapidly; in this case the tumor grew rapidly into the inferior vena cava, occluding it. This increased the pressure in the leg veins, resulting in swelling and pitting edema of the ankles.

The patient unfortunately died on the operating table.

In this patient’s case, a “tongue” of tumor grew into the inferior vena cava. At the time of surgery, the initial dissection mobilized the kidney on its vascular pedicle; however, a large portion of tumor became detached in the inferior vena cava. The tumor embolus passed through the right atrium and right ventricle and occluded the pulmonary artery. This could not be cleared at the time of surgery, and the patient succumbed.

A 65-year-old businessman came to the emergency department with severe lower abdominal pain that was predominantly central and left sided. He had pain radiating into the left loin, and he also noticed he was passing gas and fecal debris as he urinated.

A CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis was performed (eFig. 4.191).

The CT scan demonstrated a collection of fluid (likely a pelvic abscess) in the left iliac fossa. Associated with this collection of fluid was significant bowel wall thickening of the sigmoid colon and multiple small diverticula arising throughout the sigmoid colon. Gas was present in the bladder. An obstruction was noted in the left ureter and the left pelvicalyceal system.

The patient underwent an urgent operation.

The symptom of dysphagia occurs from the presence of mucosal edema, Schatzki’s ring, stricture, or the inability to organize peristaltic activity in the body of the esophagus as a consequence of the disease.There is a group of patients with sliding hiatal hernias not associated with reflux disease who have dysphagia without any obvious endoscopic or manometric explanation.

Because many of the systemic sequelae of the disease may be nondiagnostic, the motility pattern is fre-quently used as a specific diagnostic indicator. Gastroesophageal reflux commonly occurs in patients with scleroderma because they have both hypotensive sphincters and poor esophageal clearance.

Some patients with heat exhaustion develop heatstroke after removal from the heat-stress environment. Aggressive cooling of non-responders is indicated until their core temperature is 39°C (102.2°F). Except in mild cases, free water deficits should be replaced slowly over 24–48 h to avoid a decrease of serum osmolality by >2 mOsm/h.

The disposition of younger, previously healthy heat-exhaustion patients who have no major laboratory abnormalities may include hospital observation and discharge after IV rehydration. Older patients with comorbidities (including cardiovascular disease) or predisposing factors often require inpatient fluid and electrolyte replacement, monitoring, and reassessment.

The clinical manifestations of heatstroke reflect a total loss of thermo-regulatory function. Typical vital-sign abnormalities include tachypnea, various tachycardias, hypotension, and a widened pulse pressure. Although there is no single specific diagnostic test, the historical and physical triad of exposure to a heat stress, CNS dysfunction, and a core temperature >40.5°C helps establish the preliminary diagnosis.

The definitive diagnosis should be reserved until the other potential causes of hyperthermia are excluded. Many of the usual laboratory abnormalities seen with heatstroke overlap with other conditions. If the patient's mental status does not improve with cooling, toxicologic screening may be indicated, and cranial CT and spinal fluid analysis can be considered.

The premonitory clinical characteristics may be nonspecific and include weakness, dizziness, disorientation, ataxia, and gastrointestinal or psychiatric symptoms. These prodromal symptoms often resemble heat exhaustion. The sudden onset of heatstroke occurs when the maintenance of adequate perfusion requires peripheral vasoconstriction to stabilize the mean arterial blood pressure. As a result, the cutaneous radiation of heat ceases. At this juncture, the core temperature rises dramatically. Since many patients with heatstroke also meet the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome and have a broad differential diagnosis, rapid cooling is essential during the extensive diagnostic evaluation (Table 479e-1).

Changes in body temperature, hypotension, tachycardia, altered mentation, neutropenia or neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure may result from invasive burn wounds and sepsis. However, because profound alterations in homeostasis occur as a consequence of burns per se and because inflammation without infection is a normal component of these injuries, the assessment of these changes is complicated. Alterations in body temperature, for example, are attributable to thermoregulatory dysfunction; tachycardia and hyperventilation accompany the metabolic changes induced by extensive burn injury and are not necessarily indicative of bacterial sepsis.

Given the difficulty of evaluating burn wounds solely on the basis of clinical observation and laboratory data, wound biopsies are necessary

A 50-year-old woman was admitted to hospital for surgical resection of the uterus (hysterectomy) for cancer. The surgeon was also going to remove all the pelvic lymph nodes and carry out a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of uterine tubes and ovaries). The patient was prepared for this procedure and underwent routine surgery. Twenty-five hours after surgery, it was noted that the patient had passed no urine and her abdomen was expanding. An ultrasound scan demonstrated a considerable amount of fluid within the abdomen. Fluid withdrawn from the abdomen was tested and found to be urine.

It was postulated that this patient’s ureters had been damaged during the surgery.

The pelvic part of the ureter courses posteroinferiorly and external to the parietal peritoneum on the lateral wall of the pelvis anterior to the internal iliac artery. It continues in its course to a point approximately 2 cm superior to the ischial spine and then passes anteromedially and superior to the levator ani muscles. Importantly, the ureter closely adheres to the peritoneum. The only structure that passes between the ureter and the peritoneum in men is the ductus deferens. In women, however, as the ureter descends on the pelvic wall, it passes under the uterine artery. The ureter continues close to the lateral fornix of the vagina, especially on the left, and enters the posterosuperior angle of the bladder.

It was at this point that the ureter was inadvertently damaged.

Knowing the anatomy and recognizing the possibility of ureteric damage enabled the surgeons to reestablish continuity of the ureter surgically. The patient was hospitalized a few days longer than expected and made an uneventful recovery.

A 25-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with a complaint of pain in her right iliac fossa. The pain had developed rapidly over approximately 40 minutes and was associated with cramps and vomiting. The surgical intern made an initial diagnosis of appendicitis.

A 52-year-old woman visited her family physician with complaints of increasing lethargy and vomiting. The physician examined her and noted that compared to previous visits she had lost significant weight. She was also jaundiced, and on examination of the abdomen a well-defined 10-cm rounded mass was palpable below the liver edge in the right upper quadrant (Fig. 4.185).

The clinical diagnosis was carcinoma of the head of the pancreas.

It is difficult to appreciate how such a precise diagnosis can be made clinically when only three clinical signs have been described.

The patient’s obstruction was in the distal bile duct.

When a patient has jaundice, the causes are excessive breakdown of red blood cells (prehepatic), hepatic failure (hepatic jaundice), and posthepatic causes, which include obstruction along the length of the biliary tree.

The patient had a mass in her right upper quadrant that was palpable below the liver; this was the gallbladder.

In healthy individuals, the gallbladder is not palpable. An expanded gallbladder indicates obstruction either within the cystic duct or below the level of the cystic duct insertion (i.e., the bile duct).

The patient’s vomiting was related to the position of the tumor.

It is not uncommon for vomiting and weight loss (cachexia) to occur in patients with a malignant disease. The head of the pancreas lies within the curve of the duodenum, primarily adjacent to the descending part of the duodenum. Any tumor mass in the region of the head of the pancreas is likely to expand and may encase and invade the duodenum. Unfortunately, in this patient’s case, this happened, producing almost complete obstruction. Further discussion with the patient revealed that she was vomiting relatively undigested food soon after each meal.

A CT scan demonstrated further complications.

A 57-year-old woman underwent a right mastectomy for a breast cancer. The surgical note reported that all of the breast tissue had been removed, including the axillary process. In addition, the surgeon had dissected all lymph nodes within the axilla with their surrounding fat. The patient made an uneventful recovery.

At the first follow-up appointment, the patient’s husband told the surgeon that she had now developed a bony “spike” on her back. The surgeon was intrigued and asked the patient to reveal this spike. At examination, the spike was the inferior angle of the scapula, which appeared to be sticking out posteriorly (“winged”). Raising the arms accentuated this structure.

The medial border of the scapula was accentuated and it was noted that there was some loss of bulk of the serratus anterior muscle, which attaches to the tip of the scapula.

The nerve to this muscle was damaged.

During the surgery on the axilla, the long thoracic nerve was damaged as it passed down the lateral thoracic wall on the external surface of the serratus anterior, just deep to the skin and subcutaneous fascia.

Because the nerve was transected, it is unlikely that the patient will improve, but she was happy that she had an adequate explanation for the spike.

A 25-year-old woman was involved in a motor vehicle accident and thrown from her motorcycle. When she was admitted to the emergency room, she was unconscious. A series of tests and investigations were performed, one of which included chest radiography. The attending physician noted a complex fracture of the first rib on the left.

Many important structures that supply the upper limb pass over rib I.

It is important to test the nerves that supply the arm and hand, although this is extremely difficult to do in an unconscious patient. However, some muscle reflexes can be determined using a tendon hammer. Also, it may be possible to test for pain reflexes in patients with altered consciousness levels. Palpation of the axillary artery, brachial artery, radial artery, and ulnar artery pulses is necessary because a fracture of the first rib can sever and denude the subclavian artery, which passes over it.

Bleeding from right colonic vascular ectasias in the elderly may be overt or occult; it tends to be chronic and only occasionally is hemodynamically significant. Endoscopic hemostatic therapy may be useful in the treatment of vascular ectasias, as well as discrete bleeding ulcers and postpolypectomy bleeding. Surgical therapy is generally required for major, persistent, or recurrent bleeding from the wide variety of colonic sources of GIB that cannot be treated medically, angiographically, or endoscopically.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT:

Measurement of the heart rate and blood pressure is the best way to initially assess a patient with GIB. Clinically significant bleeding leads to postural changes in heart rate or blood pressure, tachycardia, and, finally, recumbent hypotension. In contrast, the hemoglobin does not fall immediately with acute GIB, due to proportionate reductions in plasma and red cell volumes (i.e., “people bleed whole blood”). Thus, hemoglobin may be normal or only minimally decreased at the initial presentation of a severe bleeding episode. As extravascular fluid enters the vascular space to restore volume, the hemoglobin falls, but this process may take up to 72 h. Transfusion is recommended when the hemoglobin drops below 7 g/dL, based on a large randomized trial showing this restrictive transfusion strategy decreases rebleeding and death in acute UGIB compared with a transfusion threshold of 9 g/dL. Patients with slow, chronic GIB may have very low hemoglobin values despite normal blood pressure and heart rate. With the development of iron-deficiency anemia, the mean corpuscular volume will be low and red blood cell distribution width will increase.

If the fasting plasma glucose level is less than 126 mg/dL (7 mMol/L) but diabetes is nonetheless suspected, then a standardized oral glucose tolerance test may be done (Table 41–4). The patient should eat nothing after midnight prior to the test day. On the morning of the test, adults are then given 75 g of glucose in 300 mL of water; children are given 1.75 g of glucose per kilogram of ideal body weight. The glucose load is consumed within 5 minutes. Blood samples for plasma glucose are obtained at 0 and 120 minutes after ingestion of glucose. An oral glucose tolerance test is normal if the fasting venous plasma glucose value is less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) and the 2-hour value falls below 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L). A fasting value of 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher or a 2-hour value of greater than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus. Patients with 2-hour value of 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.1 mmol/L) have impaired glucose tolerance.

B. Hemoglobin A1c Measurements

When plasma glucose levels are in the normal range, about 4–6% of hemoglobin A has one or both of the N terminal valines of their beta chains irreversibly glycated by glucose—referred to as hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). The HbA1c fraction is abnormally elevated in people with diabetes with chronic hyperglycemia. Since red cells have a lifespan of up to 120 days, the HbA1c value reflects plasma glucose levels over the preceding 8–12 weeks. In patients who monitor their glucose levels, the HbA1c value provides a valuable check on the accuracy of their monitoring. In patients who do not monitor their glucose levels, HbA1c measurements are essential for adjusting treatment. HbA1c can be used to diagnose diabetes. An HbA1c of 6.5% or greater if confirmed by repeat testing is diagnostic of diabetes. Less than 5.7% is normal, and patients with levels of 5.7–6.4% are considered at high risk for developing diabetes (Table 41–4).

Polycythemia is defined as an increase in the hemoglobin above normal. This increase may be real or only apparent because of a decrease in plasma volume (spurious or relative polycythemia). The term erythrocytosis may be used interchangeably with polycythemia, but some draw a distinction between them: erythrocytosis implies documentation of increased red cell mass, whereas polycythemia refers to any increase in red cells. Often patients with polycythemia are detected through an incidental finding of elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit levels. Concern that the hemoglobin level may be abnormally high is usually triggered at 170 g/L (17 g/dL) for men and 150 g/L (15 g/dL) for women. Hematocrit levels >50% in men or >45% in women may be abnormal. Hematocrits >60% in men and >55% in women are almost invariably associated with an increased red cell mass. Given that the machine that quantitates red cell parameters actually measures hemoglobin concentrations and calculates hematocrits, hemoglobin levels may be a better index.

Features of the clinical history that are useful in the differential diagnosis include smoking history; current living at high altitude; or a history of congenital heart disease, sleep apnea, or chronic lung disease.

respectively. Some centers have adopted more sensitive criteria, using values of <5.3 mmol/L (<95 mg/dL), <10 mmol/L (<180 mg/dL), <8.6 mmol/L (<155 mg/dL), and <7.8 mmol/L (<140 mg/dL) as the upper norms for a 3-h glucose tolerance test. Two elevated glucose values indicate a positive test. Adverse pregnancy outcomes for mother and fetus appear to increase with glucose as a continuous variable; thus it is challenging to define the optimal threshold for establishing the diagnosis of gestational diabetes.

a 50-g oral glucose challenge with a single serum glucose measurement at 60 min. If the plasma glucose is <7.8 mmol/L (<130 mg/dL), the test is considered normal. Plasma glucose >7.8 mmol/L (>130 mg/dL) warrants administration of a 100-g oral glucose challenge with plasma glucose measurements obtained in the fasting state and at 1, 2, and 3 h. Normal plasma glucose concentrations at these time points are <5.8 mmol/L (<105 mg/dL), 10.5 mmol/L (190 mg/dL), 9.1 mmol/L (165 mg/dL), and 8.0 mmol/L (145 mg/dL), respectively. Some centers

Gestational diabetes occurs in approximately 4% of pregnancies. All pregnant women should be screened for gestational diabetes unless they are in a low-risk group. Women at low risk for gestational diabetes are those <25 years of age; those with a body mass index <25 kg/m2, no maternal history of macrosomia or gestational diabetes, and no diabetes in a first-degree relative; and those who are not members of a high-risk ethnic group (African American, Hispanic, Native American). A typical two-step strategy for establishing the diagnosis of gestational diabetes involves administration of a 50-g oral glucose

The use of medications for depression is now so widespread that all physicians should be familiar with them. It must be acknowledged, however, that the magnitude of the effect on depression of these medications has been dominated by a few clinical trials. Meta-analyses of several large studies on the therapeutic effects of antidepressants suggest that clinical improvement attributable to the drugs themselves occurs in approximately 50 percent of patients; remarkably, an additional improvement in up to 25 percent is attributable to a placebo effect or, more likely, to the natural course of the disease. The remainder fails to improve in a timely manner or relapse while on medication. The incremental value of certain forms of psychotherapies is discussed further on.

Those untrained in psychiatry would be unwise to undertake the management of bipolar disease or a serious endogenous depression without the advice or assistance of a psychiatrist. On the other hand, if the symptoms are primarily neurologic (e.g., chronic headache, generalized weakness, and fatigability) and if there is a low risk of suicide, it may be appropriate for the experienced neurologist to institute treatment with antidepressant medication.

In the management of bipolar and depressive disease, six main categories of drugs are in general use—the tricyclic antidepressants, the “atypical” or nontricyclic group of compounds, the MAO inhibitors, serotonin agonists (reuptake inhibitors), antiepileptic drugs, and lithium. The pharmacologic properties and modes of action of these drugs were considered in the context of their side effects in Chap. 41. Additional points of interest are mentioned here.

Approach to the Patient The severity of depression is determined by the patient’s emotional pain and the degree of interference with her normal functioning. Depression is an agonizingly painful and disabling, but readily diagnosable and treatable, disease (108). Nevertheless, it shares the stigma of all psychiatric disorders. Patients and their families often attribute the signs and symptoms of depression to life circumstances or to a medical condition, either diagnosed or undiagnosed. The persistence of symptoms in the face of a pleasant life situation or the failure of the patient to respond to attempts at cheering, such as changes of scene, often exacerbate suffering by provoking guilt in the patient and frustration in her significant others. Some patients report low energy and general malaise rather than depressed mood. Physical symptoms are especially common in Asian and some other cultures and in the elderly (107). Some patients with severe depression continue to function and can appear normal and cheerful. The only way to rule out depression is by asking about symptoms and using the diagnostic criteria (108).

Management Both antidepressant medication and psychotherapy are effective treatments for depression. There is evidence that a combination of the two produces the best outcomes (109–111). Reports about the efficacy of alternative treatments, the most common of which is St. John’s wort, are conﬂicting, but mostly negative (112). Patients should be specifically questioned about their use of herbal and other preparations and encouraged to use those whose components are standardized. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a promising research intervention (113,114).

There are many forms of psychotherapy. Those that were specifically studied for efficacy in the treatment of depression are cognitive-behavioral therapy and interpersonal therapy. These forms of therapy are focused on present thoughts, feelings, relationships, and behaviors. Therapy continues for a set number of sessions, usually no more than 16 weekly sessions, in a prescribed, predetermined progression (115). There is increasing evidence that supportive and psychodynamic psychotherapy is effective.

document (2) 

It is especially important for the patient to have the opportunity to work out her feelings about having a psychiatric disorder, understand how it has affected her life, and feel comfortable taking medication or undergoing psychotherapy (115). Patients often attribute depression to weakness, laziness, or immorality, and they often confuse antidepressants with stimulants, tranquilizers, and other psychoactive drugs. Although written materials cannot substitute entirely for verbal instruction, it is useful to provide the patient with written material about depression so that she can review it at her leisure and with her family and friends if they have difficulty understanding her condition. There is widespread difficulty understanding written information, especially about medicine. Many or most antidepressant prescriptions are either not filled or not taken as prescribed (116).

Depression in one individual has a powerful effect on other members of the family, particularly children. This can be a motivating factor for patients who are reluctant to accept treatment.

The types and characteristics of antidepressants are presented in Table 12.3. All antidepressants have comparable therapeutic efficacy, and all require up to 2 to 4 weeks to take full effect.

It is not yet possible to identify those patients who will respond best to certain medications, but there is early evidence that depression may be related to specific neurotransmitters and respond differentially to medications affecting a given neurotransmitter. The response to treatment may differ with gender, but the data are not sufficient to drive clinical decisions (117).

It is sensible to use a more activating agent (ﬂuoxetine) in a lethargic patient and a more sedating agent (paroxetine) in an agitated patient (118). Nonetheless, responses vary on an individual basis, even within the same class of medications. The choice of antidepressant is based on side effects, dosage, cost, and the physician’s clinical experience (Table 12.4). Patients tend to respond to medications that worked for them in the past and to those that worked for depressed family members. Many patients require successive trials of two or more antidepressants before the one that is effective for them is identified. It is essential to continue active management through the usual duration of a depressive episode—9 to 12 months for major depression,

A major and often overlooked element of therapy comes from chemosensory testing itself. Confirmation or lack of conformation of loss is beneficial to patients who come to believe, in light of unsupportive family members and medical providers, that they may be “crazy.” In cases where the loss is minor, patients can be informed of the likelihood of a more positive prognosis. Importantly, quantitative testing places the patient’s problem into overall perspective. Thus, it is often therapeutic for an older person to know that, while his or her smell function is not what it used to be, it still falls above the average of his or her peer group. Without testing, many such patients are simply told they are getting old and nothing can be done for them, leading in some cases to depression and decreased self-esteem.

Disorders of Hearing

Anil K. Lalwani

Hearing loss is one of the most common sensory disorders in humans and can present at any age. Nearly 10% of the adult population has some hearing loss, and one-third of individuals age >65 years have a hearing loss of sufficient magnitude to require a hearing aid.

The function of the external and middle ear is to amplify sound to facilitate conversion of the mechanical energy of the sound wave into an electrical signal by the inner ear hair cells, a process called mechanotransduction (Fig. 43-1). Sound waves enter the external auditory canal and set the tympanic membrane (eardrum) in motion, which in turn moves the malleus, incus, and stapes of the middle ear. Movement of the footplate of the stapes causes pressure changes in the fluid-filled inner ear, eliciting a traveling wave in the basilar membrane of the cochlea. The tympanic membrane and the ossicular chain in the middle ear serve as an impedance-matching mechanism, improving the efficiency of energy transfer from air to the fluid-filled inner ear.

Pneumonia Pneumonia is defined as inﬂammation of the distal lung that includes terminal airways, alveolar spaces, and the interstitium. Pneumonia may have multiple causes, including viral and bacterial infections or aspiration. Aspiration pneumonia is usually the result of depressed awareness commonly associated with the use of drugs and alcohol or anesthesia. Viral pneumonias are caused by multiple infectious agents, including inﬂuenza A or B, parainﬂuenza virus, or respiratory syncytial virus. Most viral syndromes are spread by aerosolization associated with coughing, sneezing, and even conversation. Incubation is short, requiring only 1 to 3 days before the acute onset of fever, chills, headache, fatigue, and myalgias. Symptom intensity is directly related to intensity of the host febrile reaction. Pneumonia develops in only 1% of patients who have a viral syndrome, but mortality rates may reach 30% in immunocompromised individuals and the elderly. An additional risk is the development of secondary bacterial pneumonias after the initial viral insult. These infections are more common in elderly patients and may explain the high fatality in this group (8). Staphylococcal pneumonias, which often arise from a previous viral infection, are extremely lethal regardless of patient age. The best treatment for viral pneumonia is prevention by immunization. Treatment is supportive and consists mostly of administration of antipyretics and ﬂuids.

Bacterial pneumonia is classified as either community acquired or nosocomial, and in many cases the classification determines prognosis and antibiotic therapy. Risk factors that contribute to mortality are chronic cardiopulmonary diseases, alcoholism, diabetes, renal failure, malignancy, and malnutrition. Prognostic features associated with poor outcome include greater than two lobe involvement, respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths per minute on presentation, severe hypoxemia (<60 mm Hg on room air), hypoalbuminemia, and septicemia. Pneumonia is a common cause of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a mortality rate between 50% and 70% (9,10).

Pneumonia Pneumonia is the most common serious pneumococcal syndrome and is considered invasive when associated with a positive blood culture. Pneumococcal pneumonia can present as a mild community-acquired infection at one extreme and as a life-threatening disease requiring intubation and intensive support at the other.

presenting manifestations The presentation of pneumococcal pneumonia does not reliably distinguish it from pneumonia of other etiologies. In a subset of cases, pneumococcal pneumonia is recognized at the outset as associated with a viral upper respiratory infection and is characterized by the abrupt onset of cough and dyspnea accompanied by fever, shaking chills, and myalgias. The cough evolves from nonpurulent to productive of sputum that is purulent and sometimes tinged with blood. Patients may describe stabbing pleuritic chest pain and significant dyspnea indicating involvement of the parietal pleura. Among the elderly, the presenting clinical symptoms may be less specific, with confusion or malaise but without fever or cough. In such cases, a high index of suspicion is required because failure to treat pneumococcal pneumonia promptly in an elderly patient is likely to result in rapid evolution of the infection, with increased severity, morbidity, and risk of death.

findings on pHysical examination The clinical signs associated with pneumococcal pneumonia among adults include tachypnea (>30 breaths/min) and tachycardia, hypotension in severe cases, and fever in most cases (although not in all elderly patients). Respiratory signs are varied, including dullness to percussion in areas of the chest with significant consolidation, crackles on auscultation, reduced expansion of the chest in some cases as a result of splinting to reduce pain, bronchial breathing in a minority of cases, pleural rub in occasional cases, and cyanosis in cases with significant hypoxemia. Among infants with severe pneumonia, chest wall indrawing and nasal flaring are common. Nonrespiratory findings can include upper abdominal pain if the diaphragmatic pleura is involved as well as mental status changes, particularly confusion in elderly patients.

asthma and allergy. Exacerbating factors include viral infections, exposure to allergens and irritants (e.g., smoke, strong odors, fumes), exercise, emotions, and change in weather/humidity. Nighttime symptoms are common. Rhinosinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (especially aspirin) can aggravate asthma. Treatment of these conditions may lessen the frequency and severity of the asthma.

During acute episodes, tachypnea, tachycardia, cough, wheezing, and a prolonged expiratory phase may be present. Physical findings may be subtle. Classic wheezing may not be prominent if there is poor air movement from airway obstruction. As the attack progresses, cyanosis, diminished air movement, retractions, agitation, inability to speak, tripod sitting position, diaphoresis, and pulsus paradoxus (decrease in blood pressure of >15 mm Hg with inspiration) may be observed. Physical examination may show evidence of other atopic diseases such as eczema or allergic rhinitis.

Objective measurements of pulmonary function (spirometry) help establish the diagnosis and direct the treatment of asthma. Spirometry is used to monitor response to treatment, assess degree of reversibility with therapeutic intervention, and measure the severity of an asthma exacerbation. Children older than 5 years of age can perform spirometry maneuvers. Variability in predicted peak flow reference values make spirometry preferred to peak flow measures in the diagnosis of asthma. For younger children who cannot perform spirometry maneuvers or peak flow, a therapeutic trial of controller medications helps in the diagnosis of asthma.

CAuSES of iMPAiRED CougH

Central respiratory depression (e.g., anesthesia, sedation, or coma) 244 few minutes, is productive of benign-appearing mucoid sputum, and generally does not cause discomfort. Cough may occur in the context of other respiratory symptoms that together point to a diagnosis; for example, cough accompanied by wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness after exposure to a cat or other sources of allergens suggests asthma. At times, however, cough is the dominant or sole symptom of disease, and it may be of sufficient duration and severity that relief is sought. The duration of cough is a clue to its etiology. Acute cough (<3 weeks) is most commonly due to a respiratory tract infection, aspiration, or inhalation of noxious chemicals or smoke. Subacute cough (3–8 weeks in duration) is a common residuum of tracheobronchitis, as in pertussis or “postviral tussive syndrome.” Chronic cough (>8 weeks) may be caused by a wide variety of cardiopulmonary diseases, including those of inflammatory, infectious, neoplastic, and cardiovascular etiologies. When initial assessment with chest examination and radiography is normal, cough-variant asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, nasopharyngeal drainage, and medications (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) are the most common causes of chronic cough.

Details as to the sound, the time of occurrence during the day, and the pattern of coughing infrequently provide useful etiologic clues. Regardless of cause, cough often worsens upon first lying down at night, with talking, or with the hyperpnea of exercise; it frequently improves with sleep. An exception may involve the cough that occurs only with certain allergic exposures or exercise in cold air, as in asthma. Useful historical questions include what circumstances surround the onset of cough, what makes the cough better or worse, and whether or not the cough produces sputum.

The remaining children have more mixed temperaments. The individual temperament of a child has important implications for parenting and for the advice a pediatrician may give in anticipatory guidance or behavioral problem counseling.

Although, to some degree, temperament may be hardwired (nature) in each child, the environment (nurture) inwhich the child grows has a strong effect on the child’s adjustment. Social and cultural factors can have marked effects on the child through differences in parenting style, educational approaches, and behavioral expectations.

Developmental and behavioral problems are more common than any category of problems in pediatrics, except acute infections and trauma. In 2008 15% of children ages 3 to 7 had a developmental disability, and others had behavioral disabilities. As many as 25% of children have serious psychosocial problems. Parents often neglect to mention these problems because they think the physician is uninterested or cannot help. It is necessary to monitor development and screen for the presence of these problems at health supervision visits, particularly in the years before preschool or early childhood learning center enrollment.

Development surveillance, done at every office visit, is an informal process comparing skill levels to lists of milestones. If suspicion of developmental or behavioral issues recurs, further evaluation is warranted (Table 8-1). Surveillance does not have a standard, and screening tests are necessary.

Developmental screening involves the use of standardized screening tests to identify children who require further diagnostic assessment. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the use of validated standardized screening tools at three of the health maintenance visits: 9 months, 18 months, and 30 months. Clinics and offices that serve a higher risk patient population (children living in poverty) often perform a screening test at every health maintenance visit. A child who fails to pass a developmental screening test requires more comprehensive evaluation but does not necessarily have a delay; definitive testing must confirm. Developmental evaluations for children with suspected delays and intervention services for children with diagnosed disabilities are available free to families. A combination of U.S. state and federal funds provides these services.

development (see Fig. 173-1). Usually a family member had delayed growth or puberty but achieved a normal final height. The bone age is delayed, but the growth rate remains mostly within the lower limits of normal. Constitutional delay usually leads to a delay in secondary sexual development. Genetic or familial short stature (Table 173-3) refers to the stature of a child of short parents, who is expected to reach a lower than average height and yet normal for these parents. If the parents were malnourished as children, grew up in a zone of war, or suffered famine, the heights of the parents are less predictive. Although there are differences in height associated with ethnicity, the most significant difference in stature between ethnic groups is the result of nutrition.

Hypotonia may also be a prelude to a cerebellar motor defect. The ataxia becomes apparent when the infant makes the first reaching movements. Tremulous, irregular movements of the trunk and head are seen when the infant attempts to sit without support. Still later, as the infant attempts to stand, there is unsteadiness of the entire body.

In distinction to the gross deficits in motor development described earlier, there is a distinct group of young children who exhibit only mild abnormalities of muscle tone, clumsiness or unusual postures or rhythmic movements of the hands, tremor, and ataxia (“fine motor deficit”), or “developmental coordination disorders.” Such awkwardness in the somewhat older child is referred to as a “soft sign” and has been reviewed by Gubbay and colleagues in what they have called “the clumsy child.” Like speech delay and dyslexia, fine motor deficits of this sort are more frequent in males. Tirosh found that intranatal problems were more prevalent among children with fine motor deficits (compared to those with gross motor deficits), as were minor physical anomalies and seizures.

Systemic diseases in infancy pose special problems in evaluation of the motor system. The achievement of motor milestones is delayed by illnesses such as congenital heart disease (especially cyanotic forms), cystic fibrosis, renal and hepatic diseases, infections, and surgical procedures. Under such conditions one does well to deal with the immediate illnesses and defer pronouncements about the status of cerebral function. The brain proves to be simultaneously affected in 25 percent of patients with serious forms of congenital heart disease and an even higher proportion of patients with rubella and coxsackie B viral infections. In a disease such as cystic fibrosis, where the brain is not affected, it is advisable to depend more on the analysis of language development than on assessment of motor function, because muscular activity may be generally enfeebled.

Failure to see and to hear are the most important sensory defects affecting the infant and child. When both senses are affected, a severe cerebral defect is usually responsible; only at a later age, when the child is more testable, does it become apparent that the trouble is not with the peripheral sensory apparatus but with the central integrating mechanisms of the brain.

As already mentioned, the deaf child makes the transition from crying to cooing and babbling at the usual age of 3 to 5 months. After the sixth month, however, the child becomes much quieter, and the usual repertoire of babbling sounds becomes stereotyped and unchanging, though still uttered with pleasant voice. A more conspicuous failure comes somewhat later, when babbling fails to give way to word formation. Should deafness develop within the first few years of life, the child gradually loses such speech as had been acquired but can be retaught by the lipreading method. Speech, however, is harsh, poorly modulated, and unpleasant, and accompanied by many peculiar squeals and snorting or grunting noises. Social and other acquisitions appear at the expected times in the congenitally deaf child, unlike in the developmentally delayed child. The deaf child seems eager to communicate and makes known all his needs by gesture or pantomime, often very cleverly. The deaf child may attract attention by vivid facial expressions, motions of the lips, nodding, or head shaking. The Leiter performance scale, which makes no use of sounds, will show that intelligence is normal. Deafness can be demonstrated at an early age by careful observation of the child’s responses to sounds and by free-field audiometry, but the full range of hearing cannot be accurately tested before the age of 3 or 4 years. Recording of brainstem auditory evoked potentials and testing of the labyrinths, which are frequently unresponsive in deaf mutes, may be helpful. Early diagnosis is important so as to fit the child with a hearing aid and to begin appropriate language training.

In contrast to the child in whom deafness is the only abnormality, the developmentally delayed child generally talks little but may display a rich personality. Autistic children may also be mute; if they speak, echolalia is prominent and the personal “I” is avoided. Blind children of normal intelligence tend to speak slowly and fail to acquire imitative gestures.

The clinical impetus for screening mammogra-phy came from the Health Insurance Plan study and the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project, which demonstrated a 33% reduction in mortality for women after72 screening mam-mography. Mammography was more accurate than clinical examination for the detection of early breast cancers, providing a true-positive rate of 90%. Only 20% of women with nonpal-pable cancers had axillary lymph node metastases, compared with 50% of women with palpable cancers.141 Current guide-lines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network suggest that normal-risk women ≥20 years of age should have a breast examination at

in women invited to screening, about 11% of the cancers diagnosed in their lifetime constitute overdiagnosis. Despite this overdiagno-sis, the panel concluded that breast screening programs confer significant benefit and should continue. The use of screening mammography in women <50 years of age is more controversial for previously noted reasons: (a) reduced sensitivity, (b) reduced specificity, and (c) lower incidence of breast cancer. Because of the combination of these three reasons, targeting mammography screening to women <50 years of age, who are at higher risk of breast cancer, improves the balance of risks and benefits and

IBS is a disorder that affects all ages, although most patients have their first symptoms before age 45. Older individuals have a lower reporting frequency. Women are diagnosed with IBS two to three times as often as men and make up 80% of the population with severe IBS. As indicated in Table 352-1, pain or abdominal discomfort is a key symptom for the diagnosis of IBS. These symptoms should be improved with defecation and/or have their onset associated with a change in frequency or form of stool. Painless diarrhea or constipation does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria to be classified as IBS. Supportive symptoms that are not part of the diagnostic criteria include defecation straining, urgency or a feeling of incomplete bowel movement, passing mucus, and bloating.

Abdominal Pain According to the current IBS diagnostic criteria, abdominal pain or discomfort is a prerequisite clinical feature of IBS. Abdominal pain in IBS is highly variable in intensity and location. It is frequently episodic and crampy, but it may be superimposed on a background of constant ache. Pain may be mild enough to be ignored or it may interfere with daily activities. Despite this, malnutrition due to inadequate caloric intake is exceedingly rare with IBS. Sleep deprivation is also unusual because abdominal pain is almost uniformly present only during waking hours. However, patients with severe IBS frequently wake repeatedly during the night; thus, nocturnal pain is a poor discriminating factor between organic and functional bowel disease. Pain is often exacerbated by eating or emotional stress and improved by passage of flatus or stools. In addition, female patients with IBS commonly report worsening symptoms during the premenstrual and menstrual phases.

The predominant symptom of IBS is abdominal pain. Other symptoms include abdominal distention, excessive ﬂatulence, alternating diarrhea and constipation, increased pain before a bowel movement, decreased pain after a bowel movement, and pain exacerbated by events that increase gastrointestinal motility, such as eating, stress, anxiety, depression, and menses. The pain is usually intermittent, occasionally constant, cramp-like, and more likely to occur in the left lower quadrant. The patient with IBS can be placed into one of three categories: constipation-predominant, diarrhea-predominant, and pain-predominant (alternating bowel habits) depending on their main symptoms. The new Rome III criteria for diagnosis

Table 16.5 Rome III Criteria for Irritable Bowel Syndrome

At least 3 days per month of recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort for the previous 3 months, has associated with two of three features: 1.

Relieved with defecation; and/or 2.

Onset associated with a change in frequency of stool; and/or 3.

Onset associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool.

(Table 16.5) includes at least 3 days of recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort per month over the past 3 months with at least two of the following features: relief with defecation, onset associated with change in stool frequency, or onset associated with change in form and appearance of stool (106).

On physical examination, the findings of a palpable tender sigmoid colon or discomfort during insertion of the finger into the rectum and hard feces in the rectum are suggestive of IBS.

The diagnosis of IBS is usually based on history and physical examination, and although suggestive, especially in young women, the findings are not specific. A CBC, thyroid function study, stool sample to test for white cells and occult blood, and sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy or barium enema are usually required, particularly in older individuals and in young individuals who have not responded to initial treatment. The results of these studies are all normal in patients with IBS.

Examination of the chest includes inspection of the chest wall to identify asymmetry resulting from absence of the pectoralis muscle and inspection of the breast tissue to determine gestational age and detect a breast abscess. Boys and girls may have breast engorgement and produce milk; milk expression should not be attempted. Supernumerary nipples may be bilateral and may be associated with renal anomalies.

Examination of the lungs includes observations of the rate, depth, and nature of intercostal or sternal retractions. Breath sounds should be equal on both sides of the chest, and rales should not be heard after the first 1 to 2 hours of life. Diminished or absent breath sounds on one side suggest pneumothorax, collapsed lung, pleural effusion, or diaphragmatic hernia. Shift of the cardiac impulse away from a tension pneumothorax and diaphragmatic hernia and toward the collapsed lung is a helpful physical finding for differentiating these disorders. Subcutaneous emphysema of the neck or chest also suggests a pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum, whereas bowel sounds auscultated in the chest in the presence of a scaphoid abdomen suggest a diaphragmatic hernia.

The position of the heart in infants is more midline than in older children. The first heart sound is normal, whereas the second heart sound may not be split in the first day of life. Decreased splitting of the second heart sound is noted in PPHN, transposition of the great vessels, and pulmonary atresia. Heart murmurs in newborns are common in the delivery room and during the first day of life. Most of these murmurs are transient and are due to closure of the ductus arteriosus, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, or a small ventral septal defect. Pulses should be palpated in the upper and lower extremities (over the brachial and femoral arteries). Blood pressure in the upper and lower extremities should be measured in all patients with a murmur or heart failure. An upperto-lower extremity gradient of more than 10 to 20 mm Hg suggests coarctation of the aorta.

Inspection and Palpation In patients with severe MS, there may be a malar flush with pinched and blue facies. In patients with sinus rhythm and severe pulmonary hypertension or associated tricuspid stenosis (TS), the jugular venous pulse reveals prominent a waves due to vigorous right atrial systole. The systemic arterial pressure is usually normal or slightly low. An RV tap along the left sternal border signifies an enlarged RV. A diastolic thrill may rarely be present at the cardiac apex, with the patient in the left lateral recumbent position.

Auscultation The first heart sound (S1) is usually accentuated in the early stages of the disease and slightly delayed. The pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P2) also is often accentuated with elevated PA pressures, and the two components of the second heart sound (S2) are closely split. The opening snap (OS) of the mitral valve is most readily audible in expiration at, or just medial to, the cardiac apex. This sound generally follows the sound of aortic valve closure (A2) by 0.05–0.12 s. The time interval between A2 and OS varies inversely with the severity of the MS. The OS is followed by a low-pitched, rumbling, diastolic murmur, heard best at the apex with the patient in the left lateral recumbent position (see Fig. 267-5); it is accentuated by mild exercise (e.g., a few rapid sit-ups) carried out just before auscultation. In general, the duration of this murmur correlates with the severity of the stenosis in patients with preserved CO. In patients with sinus rhythm, the murmur often reappears or becomes louder during atrial systole (presystolic accentuation). Soft, grade I or II/VI systolic murmurs are commonly heard at the apex or along the left sternal border in patients with pure MS and do not necessarily signify the presence of MR. Hepatomegaly, ankle edema, ascites, and pleural effusion, particularly in the right pleural cavity, may occur in patients with MS and RV failure.

History and Physical Examination The chest discomfort, often severe enough to be described as frank pain, is typically located in the sub-sternal region or sometimes in the epigastrium, and radiates to the left arm, left shoulder, and/or neck. Anginal “equivalents” such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension.

Electrocardiogram ST-segment depression occurs in 20 to 25% of patients; it may be transient in patients without biomarker evidence of myocardial necrosis, but may be persistent for several days in NSTEMI. T-wave changes are common but are less specific signs of ischemia, unless they are new and deep T-wave inversions (≥0.3 mV).

Diastolic Murmurs In contrast to some systolic murmurs, diastolic heart murmurs always signify structural heart disease (Fig. 267-5). The murmur associated with acute, severe AR is relatively soft and of short duration because of the rapid rise in LV diastolic pressure and the progressive diminution of the aortic-LV diastolic pressure gradient. In contrast, the murmur of chronic severe AR is classically heard as a decrescendo, blowing diastolic murmur along the left sternal border in patients with primary valve pathology and sometimes along the right sternal border in patients with primary aortic root pathology.

With chronic AR, the pulse pressure is wide 1449 and the arterial pulses are bounding in character. These signs of significant diastolic run-off are absent in the acute phase. The murmur of pulmonic regurgitation is also heard along the left sternal border. It is most commonly due to pulmonary hypertension and enlargement of the annulus of the pulmonic valve. S2 is single and loud and may be palpable. There is a right ventricular/parasternal lift that is indicative of chronic right ventricular pressure overload. A less impressive murmur of PR is present after repair of tetralogy of Fallot or pulmonic valve atresia. In this postoperative setting, the murmur is softer and lower-pitched, and the severity of the accompanying pulmonic regurgitation can be underestimated significantly.

Child abuse must always be considered in the differential diagnosis of a child with fractures, especially in those younger than 3 years (see Chapter 22). Common fracture patterns that should increase the index of suspicion include multiple fractures in different stages of radiographic healing, metaphyseal corner fractures (shaking), fractures too severe for the history, or fractures in nonambulatory infants. Although spiral fractures of long bones were historically considered pathognomic for abuse, they can be seen in nonabuse situations.

When there is concern for child abuse, the child should have a full evaluation, which may include admission to the hospital. A thorough and well-documented physical examination should focus on soft tissue injuries, the cranium, and a funduscopic examination for retinal hemorrhages or detachment. A skeletal survey or a bone scan may be helpful in identifying other fractures.

The hip is a ball (femoral head) and socket (acetabulum) joint that is important for skeletal stability. The femoral head and acetabulum are interdependent for normal growth and development. The femoral neck and head, which contain the capital femoral epiphysis, are intra-articular. The blood supply to this region is unique because the blood vessels are extraosseous and lie on the surface of the femoral neck, entering the epiphysis peripherally. Thus, the blood supply to the femoral head is vulnerable to trauma, infection, and other causes that may increase intra-articular pressure. Damage to the blood supply can lead to avascular necrosis.

It is important to consider that gastric distention from aerophagia can severely compromise respirations.

This type of inflammatory disease of cranial arteries is an important cause of headache in older persons. All of our patients have been older than 55 years of age, most of them older than age 65. From a state of normal health, the patient develops an increasingly intense throbbing or nonthrobbing headache, often with superimposed sharp, stabbing pains. In a few patients the headache has had an almost explosive onset. The pain is usually unilateral, sometimes bilateral, and often localized to the site of the affected arteries in the scalp. The pain persists to some degree throughout the day and is particularly severe at night. It lasts for many months if untreated. The superficial temporal and other scalp arteries are frequently thickened and tender and without pulsation. Jaw claudication and ischemic nodules on the scalp, with ulceration of the overlying skin, have been described in severe cases.

Many of the patients feel generally unwell and have lost weight; some have a low-grade fever and anemia. Usually the sedimentation rate is greatly elevated (>50 mm/h and typically >75 mm/h) but elevation of the C-reactive protein (CRP) level is a more sensitive indicator of this inflammatory condition and is particularly helpful when the sedimentation rate is only mildly elevated. A few patients have a peripheral neutrophilic leukocytosis. Half of patients have generalized aching of proximal limb muscles, reflecting the presence of polymyalgia rheumatica (see Chap. 45, “Polymyalgia Rheumatica”). A relation of temporal arteritis to herpes zoster has been proposed.

The importance of early diagnosis relates to the threat of blindness from thrombosis of the ophthalmic or posterior ciliary arteries. This may be preceded by several episodes of amaurosis fugax (transient monocular blindness). Ophthalmoplegia may also occur but is less frequent, and its cause, whether neural or muscular, is not settled.

As indicated in Table 352-1, pain or abdominal discomfort is a key symptom for the diagnosis of IBS. These symptoms should be improved with defecation and/or have their onset associated with a change in frequency or form of stool. Painless diarrhea or constipation does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria to be classified as IBS. Supportive symptoms that are not part of the diagnostic criteria include defecation straining, urgency or a feeling of incomplete bowel movement, passing mucus, and bloating.

Abdominal Pain According to the current IBS diagnostic criteria, abdominal pain or discomfort is a prerequisite clinical feature of IBS. Abdominal pain in IBS is highly variable in intensity and location. It is frequently episodic and crampy, but it may be superimposed on a background of constant ache. Pain may be mild enough to be ignored or it may interfere with daily activities. Despite this, malnutrition due to inadequate caloric intake is exceedingly rare with IBS. Sleep deprivation is also unusual because abdominal pain is almost uniformly present only during waking hours. However, patients with severe IBS frequently wake repeatedly during the night; thus, nocturnal pain is a poor discriminating factor between organic and functional bowel disease. Pain is often exacerbated by eating or emotional stress and improved by passage of flatus or stools. In addition, female patients with IBS commonly report worsening symptoms during the premenstrual and menstrual phases.

The Alcohol Abstinence, or Withdrawal, Syndrome

This is the well-known symptom complex of tremulousness, hallucinations, seizures, confusion, and psychomotor and autonomic overactivity. Although a sustained period of chronic inebriation is the most obvious factor in the causation of these symptoms, they become manifest only after a period of relative or absolute abstinence from alcohol—hence the designation abstinence, or withdrawal, syndrome. Figure 41-1 illustrates this concept. Each of the major manifestations of the withdrawal syndrome may occur in more or less pure form and are so described below, but usually they occur in combination. Major withdrawal symptoms are observed mainly in the binge, or periodic, drinker, although the steady drinker is not immune if for some reason he stops drinking, such as during a hospital admission for surgery or a medical illness. The full syndrome, depicted further on, is called delirium tremens.

The most common single manifestation of the abstinence syndrome is tremulousness, often referred to as “the shakes” or “the jitters,” combined with general irritability and gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly nausea and vomiting. These symptoms first appear after several days of drinking, usually in the morning after a night’s abstinence. The patient “quiets his nerves” with a few drinks and is then able to drink for the rest of the day without undue distress. The symptoms return on successive mornings with increasing severity. The symptoms then become augmented, reaching their peak intensity 24 to 36 h after the complete cessation of drinking. Generalized tremor is the most obvious feature. It is of fast frequency (6 to 8 Hz), slightly irregular, and variable in severity, tending to diminish when the patient is in quiet surroundings and to increase with motor activity or emotional stress. The tremor may be so violent that the patient cannot stand without help, speak clearly, or eat without assistance. Sometimes there is little objective evidence of tremor, and the patient complains only of being “shaky inside.”

Reeling Gait of Intoxication

This is characteristic of inebriation with alcohol, sedative drugs, and antiepileptic drugs. The drunken patient totters, reels, tips forward and then backward, appearing each moment to be on the verge of losing his balance and falling. Control over the trunk and legs are greatly impaired. The steps are irregular and uncertain. Such patients may appear indifferent to the quality of their performance, but under certain circumstances they can momentarily correct the defect. As indicated above, the adjectives drunken and reeling are used frequently to describe the gait of cerebellar disease, but the similarities between them are only superficial. The severely intoxicated patient reels or sways in many different directions and seemingly makes little or no effort to correct the staggering by watching his legs or the ground, as occurs in cerebellar or sensory ataxia. Also, the variability of the drunken gait is noteworthy. Despite wide excursions of the body and deviation from the line of march, the drunken patient may, for short distances, be able to walk on a narrow base and maintain his balance. In contrast, the patient with cerebellar gait has great difficulty in correcting his balance if he sways or lurches too far to one side. Milder degrees of the drunken gait resemble the gait disorder that follows loss of labyrinthine function discussed below.

Anxiety disorder is a chronic state, some would say a disease, punctuated by recurrent attacks of acute anxiety or panic. The acute attacks are the hallmark of the disease and some psychiatrists are reluctant to make a diagnosis of anxiety neurosis in their absence. Because of the clinical features of panic attacks and particularly their episodic nature, simulating an acute medical condition, they are of special interest to neurologists and general physicians. While anxiety may be inferred from observing the activities of young children, and is reported as a form of nervousness by older children and adolescents, more often there are physical complaints at times of transition or stress during the day or year.

Panic attacks in their full form are prone to begin after this age and are almost as dramatic as seizures. They often begin with distressing feelings of dread and foreboding. The patient is assailed by a sense of strangeness, as though his body had changed or the surroundings were unreal. He is frightened, sometimes by the prospect of imminent death (angor animi) or of losing his mind or self-control. There may be a feeling of smothering. “I am dying” or “I can’t breathe” are characteristic expressions of alarm and panic. The heart races, breathing comes in rapid gasps, the pupils may be dilated, and the patient may sweat or tremble. The palpitation and breathing difficulties are so prominent that a cardiologist is often consulted. Some of our psychiatric colleagues identify breathlessness or a suffocating feeling as central to the diagnosis of panic (and attribute psychologic meaning to the symptom), but this is not sustained in our observations of affected patients. The symptoms abate spontaneously after 15 to 30 min, leaving the patient shaken, tense, perplexed, and often embarrassed. There is no confusion, and after the episode there is full memory of the event.

In our experience, delusions are more common in older patients and tend to appear only after weeks or months of more typical symptoms of depression. Common ones in experience with our patients have been gas poisoning in the house, unaccustomed suspiciousness, alleged home break ins, having inadequate money, or being stolen from or cheated. (Some of these arise in early dementia as well.) Hallucinations, when they occur, are

The depressed patient tends to move slowly, sighing is frequent, and speech is reduced. The mental life of such an individual may narrow to a single-minded concern about physical or mental health. In dialogue, the patient’s responses become so stereotyped that the listener can soon predict exactly what is going to be said. There is a poverty of ideation and sometimes a notable absence of insight. Consciousness is clear, and although there is no evidence of a schizophrenic type of thought disorder, delusional ideas, and less often hallucinations, may be prominent in some patients, justifying the term

When the fever subsided, she developed a maculopapular rash over the trunk and extremities with painful wrists and fingers. She also reports abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and headaches. Last week she returned from a trip to Africa where she spent several weeks, mostly in rural areas. Her temperature is 37.5℃ (99.5℉); pulse is 75/min; respiratory rate is 13/min, and blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg. A maculopapular rash is observed over the trunk and limbs. Both ankles are swollen and painful to active and passive motion. The abdomen is soft without organomegaly. Laboratory studies show the following:

The median presenting leukocyte count is about 15,000/μL. Between 25 and 40% of patients have counts <5000/μL, and 20% have counts >100,000/μL. Fewer than 5% have no detectable leukemic cells in the blood. The morphology of the malignant cell varies in different subsets. In AML, the cytoplasm often contains primary (nonspecific) granules, and the nucleus shows fine, lacy chromatin with one or more nucleoli characteristic of immature cells. Abnormal rod-shaped granules called Auer rods are not uniformly present, but when they are, myeloid lineage is virtually certain (Fig. 132-1). Poor neutrophil function may be noted functionally by impaired phagocytosis and migration and morphologically by abnormal lobulation and deficient granulation.

Platelet counts <100,000/μL are found at diagnosis in ~75% of patients, and about 25% have counts <25,000/μL. Both morphologic and functional platelet abnormalities can be observed, including large and bizarre shapes with abnormal granulation and inability of platelets to aggregate or adhere normally to one another.

Pretreatment Evaluation Once the diagnosis of AML is suspected, a rapid evaluation and initiation of appropriate therapy should follow. In addition to clarifying the subtype of leukemia, initial studies should evaluate the overall functional integrity of the major organ systems, including the cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, and renal systems (Table 132-4). Factors that have prognostic significance, either for achieving CR or for predicting the duration of CR, should also be assessed before initiating treatment, including cytogenetics and molecular markers (see above). Leukemic cells should be obtained from all patients and cryopreserved for future use as new tests and therapeutics become available. All patients should be evaluated for infection.

Most patients are anemic and thrombocytopenic at presentation. Replacement of the appropriate blood components, if necessary, should begin promptly. Because qualitative platelet dysfunction or the presence of an infection may increase the likelihood of bleeding, evidence of hemorrhage justifies the immediate use of platelet transfusion, even if the platelet count is only moderately decreased.

Physical Findings Splenomegaly is the most common physical finding, occurring in 20–70% of patients depending on health care screening frequency. Other less common findings include hepatomegaly (10–20%), lymphadenopathy (5–10%), and extramedullary disease (skin or subcutaneous lesions). The latter indicates CML transformation if a biopsy confirms the presence of sheets of blasts. Other physical findings are manifestations of complications of high tumor burden described earlier (e.g., cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, bleeding). High basophil counts may be associated with histamine overproduction causing pruritus, diarrhea, flushing, and even gastrointestinal ulcers.

Hematologic and Marrow Findings In untreated CML, leukocytosis ranging from 10–500 × 109/L is common. The peripheral blood differential shows left-shifted hematopoiesis with predominance of neutrophils and the presence of bands, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, promyelocytes, and blasts (usually ≤5%). Basophils and/or eosinophils are frequently increased. Thrombocytosis is common, but thrombocytopenia is rare and, when present, suggests a worse prognosis, disease acceleration, or an unrelated etiology. Anemia is present in one-third of patients. Cyclic oscillations of counts are noted in 25% of patients without treatment. Biochemical abnormalities include a low leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score and high levels of vitamin B12, uric acid, lactic dehydrogenase, and lysozyme. The presence of unexplained and sustained leukocytosis, with or without splenomegaly, should lead to a marrow examination and cytogenetic analysis.

Generally speaking, visceral adiposity correlates with hepatic fat content (Cornier, 201l). With obesity, excessive fat accumulates in the liver-hepatic steatosis, which is also called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In persons with the metabolic syndrome, steatosis can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis, as well as hepatocellular carcinoma. Indeed, one fourth of chronic liver disease cases worldwide are caused by NAFLD (Younossi, 2016). \10reover, NAFLD is strongly associated with both fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease (T argher, 2016).

LABORATORY STUDIES Blood Anemia is present in most cases, either alone or as part of bi-or pancytopenia; isolated neutropenia or thrombocytopenia is more unusual. Macrocytosis is common, and the smear may be dimorphic with a distinctive population of large red blood cells. Platelets are also large and lack granules. In functional studies, they may show marked abnormalities, and patients may have bleeding symptoms despite seemingly adequate numbers. Neutrophils are hypogranulated; have hyposegmented, ringed, or abnormally segmented nuclei; contain Döhle bodies; and may be functionally deficient. Circulating myeloblasts usually correlate with marrow blast numbers, and their quantity is important for classification and prognosis. The total white blood cell count (WBC) is usually normal or low, except in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. As in aplastic anemia, MDS can be associated with a clonal population of PNH cells. Genetic testing is commercially available for constitutional syndromes.

Bone Marrow The bone marrow is usually normal or hypercellular, but in about 20% of cases, it is sufficiently hypocellular to be confused with aplasia. No single characteristic feature of marrow morphology distinguishes MDS, but the following are commonly observed: dyserythropoietic changes (especially nuclear abnormalities) and ringed sideroblasts in the erythroid lineage; hypogranulation and hyposegmentation in granulocytic precursors, with an increase in myeloblasts; and megakaryocytes showing reduced numbers of or disorganized aGood, normal, –Y, del(5q), del (20q); poor, complex (≥3 abnormalities) or chromosome 7 abnormalities; intermediate, all other abnormalities. bCytopenias defined as hemoglobin <100 g/L, platelet count <100,000/μL, and absolute neutrophil count <1500/μL.

nuclei. Megaloblastic nuclei associated with defective hemoglobinization in the erythroid lineage are common. Prognosis strongly correlates with the proportion of marrow blasts. Cytogenetic analysis and fluorescent in situ hybridization can identify chromosomal abnormalities.

Bleeding from right colonic vascular ectasias in the elderly may be overt or occult; it tends to be chronic and only occasionally is hemodynamically significant. Endoscopic hemostatic therapy may be useful in the treatment of vascular ectasias, as well as discrete bleeding ulcers and postpolypectomy bleeding. Surgical therapy is generally required for major, persistent, or recurrent bleeding from the wide variety of colonic sources of GIB that cannot be treated medically, angiographically, or endoscopically.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT:

Measurement of the heart rate and blood pressure is the best way to initially assess a patient with GIB. Clinically significant bleeding leads to postural changes in heart rate or blood pressure, tachycardia, and, finally, recumbent hypotension. In contrast, the hemoglobin does not fall immediately with acute GIB, due to proportionate reductions in plasma and red cell volumes (i.e., “people bleed whole blood”). Thus, hemoglobin may be normal or only minimally decreased at the initial presentation of a severe bleeding episode. As extravascular fluid enters the vascular space to restore volume, the hemoglobin falls, but this process may take up to 72 h. Transfusion is recommended when the hemoglobin drops below 7 g/dL, based on a large randomized trial showing this restrictive transfusion strategy decreases rebleeding and death in acute UGIB compared with a transfusion threshold of 9 g/dL. Patients with slow, chronic GIB may have very low hemoglobin values despite normal blood pressure and heart rate. With the development of iron-deficiency anemia, the mean corpuscular volume will be low and red blood cell distribution width will increase.

Acute infections are most often subclinical and anicteric.

When they are clinically apparent, nausea and vomiting, headache, and malaise may precede jaundice by 1 to 2 weeks. Lowgrade fever is more common with hepatitis A. By the time jaundice develops, symptoms are usually improving. Serum transaminase levels vary, and their peaks do not correspond with disease severity (see Table 55-1). Peak levels that range from 400 to 4000 U/L are usually reached by the time jaundice develops. Serum bilirubin values typically continue to rise, despite falling serum transaminase levels, and peak at 5 to 20 mgl dL.

Any evidence for severe disease should prompt hospitalization. These include persistent nausea and vomiting, prolonged prothrombin time, low serum albumin level, hypoglycemia, high serum bilirubin level, or central nervous system symptoms. In most cases, however, clinical and biochemical recovery is complete within 1 to 2 months in all cases of hepatitis A, in most cases of hepatitis B, but in only a small proportion of cases of hepatitis C.

When patients are hospitalized, their feces, secretions, bedpans, and other articles in contact with the intestinal tract should be handled with glove-protected hands. Extra precautions, such as double gloving during delivery and surgical procedures, are recommended. Due to significant exposure of health-care personnel to hepatitis B, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2016a) recommend active and passive vaccination, described later. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C, so recommendations are for postexposure serosurveillance only.

Acute hepatitis has a case-fatality rate of 0.1 percent. For patients ill enough to be hospitalized, it may reach 1 percent. Most fatalities are due to fulminant hepatic necrosis, which in later pregnancy may resemble acute fatty liver. In these cases, hepatic encephalopathy is the usual presentation, and the mortality rate is 80 percent. Approximately half of patients with fulminant disease have hepatitis B infection, and co-infection with the delta agent is common.

Gastrointestinal manifestations such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and ileus may suggest acute gastroenteritis. Stress ulceration can lead to upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Cholestatic jaundice, with elevated levels of serum bilirubin (mostly conjugated) and alkaline phosphatase, may precede other signs of sepsis. Hepatocellular or canalicular dysfunction appears to underlie most cases, and the results of hepatic function tests return to normal with resolution of the infection. Prolonged or severe hypotension may induce acute hepatic injury or ischemic bowel necrosis.

Many tissues may be unable to extract oxygen normally from the blood, so that anaerobic metabolism occurs despite near-normal mixed venous oxygen saturation. Blood lactate levels rise early because of increased glycolysis as well as impaired clearance of the resulting lactate and pyruvate by the liver and kidneys. The blood glucose concentration often increases, particularly in patients with diabetes, although impaired gluconeogenesis and excessive insulin release on occasion produce hypoglycemia. The cytokine-driven acute-phase response inhibits the synthesis of transthyretin while enhancing the production of C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and complement components. Protein catabolism is often markedly accelerated. Serum albumin levels decline as a result of decreased hepatic synthesis and the movement of albumin into interstitial spaces.

The Patient With a Recent Stroke That May Not Be Complete

If hours have passed since the first symptoms of stroke but the syndrome is fluctuating or advancing, the basic problem is whether a thrombotic infarction (venous or arterial) will spread and involve more brain tissue; or if embolic, whether the ischemic tissue will become hemorrhagic or another embolus will occur; or if there is an arterial dissection, whether it will give rise to emboli. Therapies are controversial in most of these circumstances. In some centers, it is the practice to try to prevent propagation of a thrombus by administering heparin (or low-molecular-weight heparin) followed by warfarin, as discussed earlier. Some stroke deficits fluctuate with blood pressure, suggesting occlusion of the carotid or of another large vessel. Attention to adequate cerebral perfusion by omitting the patient’s usual blood pressure medications, ensuring adequate hydration and avoiding hemoconcentration, and potentially utilizing a head-down position may all assist in stabilizing the situation.

The Inevident or Misconstrued Syndromes of Cerebrovascular Disease

Although hemiplegia is the typical manifestation of stroke, cerebrovascular disease may manifest itself by signs that spare the motor pathways but have the same serious diagnostic and therapeutic implications. The following stroke syndromes tend to be overlooked.

Sometimes disregarded is a leaking aneurysm presenting as a sudden and intense generalized headache lasting hours or days and unlike any headache in the past. Examination may disclose no abnormality except for a slightly stiff neck and raised blood pressure. Failure to investigate such a case by imaging procedures and examination of the CSF may permit the occurrence of a later massive subarachnoid hemorrhage. Small cerebral hemorrhages, subdural hematomas, and brain tumors figure into the differential diagnosis, which is usually settled by a CT or MRI.

A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 36-hour history of lower abdominal pain that was sharp and initially intermittent, later becoming constant and severe. The patient also reported feeling nauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have diarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours before admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative.

On physical examination there was tenderness in the right iliac fossa with guarding. On vaginal examination a tender mass in the right adnexal region was felt. The patient subsequently underwent a transvaginal ultrasound examination for evaluation of adnexal pathology. The scan showed a markedly enlarged right ovary measuring up to 8 cm in long axis with echogenic stroma and peripherally distributed follicles. There was no internal vascularity when color Doppler was applied. A small amount of free fluid was seen in the pouch of Douglas. The diagnosis of ovarian torsion was made.

Ovarian torsion is the twisting of an ovary on its suspensory ligament, which contains arterial, venous, and lymphatic vessels (forming so-called vascular pedicle), leading to a compromised blood supply. Initially, the venous and lymphatic circulation is compromised, resulting in ovarian edema and enlargement. The arterial flow is maintained longer due to thicker and less compressible arterial walls. Prolonged torsion leads to increased internal ovarian pressure that eventually results in arterial thrombosis, ischemia of the ovarian tissue, and necrosis. If the correct diagnosis and treatment are delayed, the patient may develop generalized sepsis.

The symptoms are nonspecific, making the diagnosis of ovarian torsion challenging. There is often no significant past medical history.

The pain is referred.

The visceral afferent (sensory) nerve fibers from the ureter pass into the spinal cord, entering the first and second lumbar segments of the spinal cord. Pain is thus referred to cutaneous regions innervated by somatic sensory nerves from the same spinal cord levels.

The patient was investigated by a CT scan.

Traditionally, a plain radiograph was used to look for the radiopaque stone (90% of renal stones are radiopaque) and this often proceeded to intravenous urography to determine precise location of renal stones. Currently, low-dose CT of the collecting system is used to visualize the renal stones and pinpoint the level of obstruction, using low radiation dose and no intravenous contrast.

An ultrasound scan may also be useful to assess for pelvicaliceal dilation and may reveal stones at the pelviureteral junction or the vesicoureteric junction. Ultrasound is also valuable for assessing other causes of obstruction (e.g., tumors at and around the ureteric orifices in the bladder) and is particularly useful in pregnant women when imaging with the use of radiation is a concern.

Usually an intravenous urogram would be carried out to enable assessment of the upper urinary tracts and precise location of the stone.

Not infrequently, CT scans of the abdomen are also obtained. These scans not only give information about the kidneys, ureters, and bladder but also show the position of the stone and other associated pathology.

If this patient’s infrascapular pain was on the right and predominantly within the right lower abdomen, appendicitis would also have to be excluded. A CT scan would enable differentiation of appendicitis and urinary colic.

A 27-year-old woman was admitted to the surgical ward with appendicitis. She underwent an appendectomy. It was noted at operation that the appendix had perforated and there was pus within the abdominal cavity. The appendix was removed and the stump tied. The abdomen was washed out with warm saline solution. The patient initially made an uneventful recovery, but by day 7 she had become unwell, with pain over her right shoulder and spiking temperatures.

A 52-year-old woman visited her family physician with complaints of increasing lethargy and vomiting. The physician examined her and noted that compared to previous visits she had lost significant weight. She was also jaundiced, and on examination of the abdomen a well-defined 10-cm rounded mass was palpable below the liver edge in the right upper quadrant (Fig. 4.185).

The clinical diagnosis was carcinoma of the head of the pancreas.

It is difficult to appreciate how such a precise diagnosis can be made clinically when only three clinical signs have been described.

The patient’s obstruction was in the distal bile duct.

When a patient has jaundice, the causes are excessive breakdown of red blood cells (prehepatic), hepatic failure (hepatic jaundice), and posthepatic causes, which include obstruction along the length of the biliary tree.

The patient had a mass in her right upper quadrant that was palpable below the liver; this was the gallbladder.

In healthy individuals, the gallbladder is not palpable. An expanded gallbladder indicates obstruction either within the cystic duct or below the level of the cystic duct insertion (i.e., the bile duct).

The patient’s vomiting was related to the position of the tumor.

It is not uncommon for vomiting and weight loss (cachexia) to occur in patients with a malignant disease. The head of the pancreas lies within the curve of the duodenum, primarily adjacent to the descending part of the duodenum. Any tumor mass in the region of the head of the pancreas is likely to expand and may encase and invade the duodenum. Unfortunately, in this patient’s case, this happened, producing almost complete obstruction. Further discussion with the patient revealed that she was vomiting relatively undigested food soon after each meal.

A CT scan demonstrated further complications.

Pneumonia can present as right or left upper quadrant abdominal pain.

All female patients with an acute abdomen require a pelvic exam and a pregnancy test to rule out PID, ectopic pregnancy, and ovarian torsion.

McBurney’s point is located one-third of the distance from the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus.

“Hamburger sign”: If a patient wants to eat, consider a diagnosis other than appendicitis. Anorexia is 80% specific for appendicitis.

Psoas sign: Passive extension of the hip leading to RLQ pain.

Obturator sign: Passive internal rotation of the ﬂ exed hip leading to RLQ pain.

Rovsing’s sign: Deep palpation of the LLQ leading to RLQ pain.

In perforated appendix, partial pain relief is possible, but peritoneal signs (e.g., rebound, guarding, hypotension, ↑ WBC count, fever) will ultimately develop.

Children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with retrocecal appendices may have atypical presentations that may result in misdiagnosis and ↑ mortality.

Diagnosed by clinical impression.

Look for fever, mild leukocytosis (11,000–15,000 cells/μL) with left shift, and UA with a few RBCs and/or WBCs.

If the clinical diagnosis is unequivocal, no imaging studies are necessary. Otherwise, studies include the following:

KUB: Fecalith or loss of psoas shadow.

Ultrasound: Enlarged, noncompressible appendix.

CT scan with contrast (95–98% sensitive): Periappendiceal stranding or ﬂuid; enlarged appendix.

The patient should be NPO and should receive IV hydration and antibiotics with anaerobic and gram-coverage.

Immediate open or laparoscopic appendectomy is the definitive treatment. If appendicitis is not found, complete exploration of the abdomen is performed.

His symptoms only lasted for a few seconds and resolved spontaneously. This is the third time he experienced such an episode. He says that he recently started having nightmares. His father died of sudden cardiac death at the age of 45 years without a history of hypertension or any chronic cardiac disorder. A complete physical examination was normal. A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevations in V1, V2, and V3, and the presence of incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB). After a complete diagnostic evaluation, Brugada syndrome was diagnosed. He has prescribed a class I anti-arrhythmic drug, which is a sodium channel blocker that slows phase 0 depolarization in ventricular muscle fibers. The drug also blocks potassium channels and prolongs action potential duration, but it does not shorten phase 3 repolarization. The drug also has mild anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activity.

Affected individuals are often women in the third or fourth decade of life. Fatigue, dizziness, and even syncope may accompany palpitations, which can be disabling. Additional symptoms of chest pain, headaches, and gastrointestinal upset are common. It must be distinguished from appropriate sinus tachycardia and from focal atrial tachycardia, as discussed above. Misdiagnosis of physiologic sinus tachycardia with an anxiety disorder is common. Therapy is often ineffective or poorly tolerated. Careful titration of beta blockers and/ or calcium channel blockers may reduce symptoms. Clonidine and 1477 serotonin reuptake inhibitors have also been used. Ivabradine, a drug that blocks the If current causing sinus node depolarization, is promising but is not approved for use in the United States. Catheter ablation of the sinus node has been used, but long-term control of symptoms is usually poor, and it often leaves young individuals with a permanent pacemaker.

When symptomatic sinus tachycardia occurs with postural hypo-tension, the syndrome is called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Symptoms are often similar to those in patients with inappropriate sinus tachycardia. POTS is sometimes due to autonomic dysfunction following a viral illness and may resolve spontaneously over 3–12 months. Volume expansion with salt supplementation, oral fludrocortisone, compression stockings, and the α-agonist midodrine, often in combination, can be helpful. Exercise training has also been purported to improve symptoms.

The diagnosis is one of exclusion, and care should be taken to ensure that patients do not have intermittent dizziness due to TIA. In patients < 50 years of age, a history of recent trauma or of severe, abrupt-onset, or persistent pain (> 72 hours) should raise concern for vertebral artery dissection with TIAs.

A brain MRI with vascular imaging (e.g., MRA) is sometimes indicated to assess potential intracranial pathology, particularly cerebrovascular disease.

Episodic ataxia type 2 can be corroborated by genetic testing.

Tx: Can usually be prevented through migraine medication, diet, or lifestyle changes. Benzodiazepines or antiemetics may be tried. Surgical therapies are not indicated.

One of the most common causes of loss of consciousness 2° to an abrupt drop in cerebral perfusion. Etiologies include cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac outﬂow obstruction, vasovagal syncope, orthostatic hypotension, micturition-related syncope, basilar TIAs, and idiopathic causes. Presyncope is described as a feeling of imminent loss of consciousness without actual fainting. Commonly confused with seizures.

Patients may report a trigger (e.g., standing for long period of time, fear/sight of blood, Valsalva maneuver).

Ménière’s disease consists of recurrent episodes, but unlike BPPV, these usually last hours to days.

Unlike Ménière’s, vestibular migraine usually has no associated auditory or aural symptoms.

Rule out vertebral artery dissection in those with persistent head or neck pain and intermittent isolated dizziness or vertigo.

■Typically follows a prodrome of lightheadedness or dizziness, muff ed sounds, constricting vision, diffuse weakness, diaphoresis, or pallor. Leads to loss of consciousness and muscle tone for < 30 seconds and recovery within seconds.

Calcium-channel blockers represent a major therapeutic breakthrough for patients with coronary artery disease. They are effective in patients with hypertension and peripheral vascular disease. The mechanism of action is to block calcium movement across smooth muscle, therefore promoting vessel wall relaxation. Calcium channel blockers are useful in treating concurrent hypertension and ischemic heart disease as an alternative to beta-blockers, if needed. Additionally, these drugs are particularly effective in the elderly and African Americans. Side effects noted include headache, dizziness, constipation, gastroesophageal reﬂux, and peripheral edema. The addition of long-acting calcium-channel blockers made these preparations more amenable for use in hypertension. A relative contraindication for use of these drugs is the presence of congestive heart failure or conduction disturbances.

Hydralazine is a potent vasodilator used for years in obstetrics for severe hypertension associated with preeclampsia and eclampsia. The mechanism of action is direct relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, primarily arterial. Major side effects include headaches, tachycardia, and ﬂuid (sodium) retention that may result in paradoxical hypertension. Several combinations are used to counter the side effects and enhance antihypertensive effects. Diuretics may be added to reverse ﬂuid retention caused by excess sodium. When used in combination with beta-blockers, tachycardia and headaches may be controlled without compromising the objective of lowering blood pressure. Drug-induced lupus was widely stated as a potential side effect but is rare with normal therapeutic doses of 25 to 50 mg three times daily. Minoxidil is another extremely potent drug in this class but is of limited use to the gynecologist because of its side effects in women (beard growth). Because of minoxidil’s potency, only experienced practitioners should use it.

Beta-blockers were used extensively for years as antihypertensive agents. The mechanism of action is decreasing cardiac output and plasma renin activity, with some increase in total peripheral resistance. As a class, they are an excellent source of first-line therapy, especially for migraine sufferers. The original formulation, propranolol, is highly lipid soluble and contributed to bothersome side effects such as depression, sleep disturbances (nightmares in the elderly), and constipation in higher doses. Propranolol has a relative lack of beta selectivity, which promotes other undesirable phenomena. Formulations such as atenolol are water soluble, are beta1

to beta-blockers are asthma, sick sinus syndrome, or bradyarrhythmia. Beta-blockers are often used for the treatment of angina and after myocardial infarctions. However, if these drugs are acutely withdrawn, a rebound phenomenon of ischemia may occur, leading to acute myocardial infarction. Despite these potential problems, beta-blockers continue to be useful in counteracting reﬂex tachycardia, which often occurs with the use of smooth muscle relaxing drugs.

water soluble, are beta1 selective, and have fewer side effects than propranolol. At higher doses, beta2 effects emerge. There is no evidence to support speculation that beta1 selective agents may be safe for use in individuals who have asthma. An advantage of water-soluble agents is a longer half-life. Reduced dosing schedules improve compliance. Side effects of beta-blockers include an increase in triglyceride levels and a decrease in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and blunting of adrenergic release in response to hypoglycemia. NSAIDs may decrease the effectiveness of beta-blockers. Contraindications to beta-blockers are

Bleeding from right colonic vascular ectasias in the elderly may be overt or occult; it tends to be chronic and only occasionally is hemodynamically significant. Endoscopic hemostatic therapy may be useful in the treatment of vascular ectasias, as well as discrete bleeding ulcers and postpolypectomy bleeding. Surgical therapy is generally required for major, persistent, or recurrent bleeding from the wide variety of colonic sources of GIB that cannot be treated medically, angiographically, or endoscopically.

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT:

Measurement of the heart rate and blood pressure is the best way to initially assess a patient with GIB. Clinically significant bleeding leads to postural changes in heart rate or blood pressure, tachycardia, and, finally, recumbent hypotension. In contrast, the hemoglobin does not fall immediately with acute GIB, due to proportionate reductions in plasma and red cell volumes (i.e., “people bleed whole blood”). Thus, hemoglobin may be normal or only minimally decreased at the initial presentation of a severe bleeding episode. As extravascular fluid enters the vascular space to restore volume, the hemoglobin falls, but this process may take up to 72 h. Transfusion is recommended when the hemoglobin drops below 7 g/dL, based on a large randomized trial showing this restrictive transfusion strategy decreases rebleeding and death in acute UGIB compared with a transfusion threshold of 9 g/dL. Patients with slow, chronic GIB may have very low hemoglobin values despite normal blood pressure and heart rate. With the development of iron-deficiency anemia, the mean corpuscular volume will be low and red blood cell distribution width will increase.

Acute infections are most often subclinical and anicteric.

When they are clinically apparent, nausea and vomiting, headache, and malaise may precede jaundice by 1 to 2 weeks. Lowgrade fever is more common with hepatitis A. By the time jaundice develops, symptoms are usually improving. Serum transaminase levels vary, and their peaks do not correspond with disease severity (see Table 55-1). Peak levels that range from 400 to 4000 U/L are usually reached by the time jaundice develops. Serum bilirubin values typically continue to rise, despite falling serum transaminase levels, and peak at 5 to 20 mgl dL.

Any evidence for severe disease should prompt hospitalization. These include persistent nausea and vomiting, prolonged prothrombin time, low serum albumin level, hypoglycemia, high serum bilirubin level, or central nervous system symptoms. In most cases, however, clinical and biochemical recovery is complete within 1 to 2 months in all cases of hepatitis A, in most cases of hepatitis B, but in only a small proportion of cases of hepatitis C.

When patients are hospitalized, their feces, secretions, bedpans, and other articles in contact with the intestinal tract should be handled with glove-protected hands. Extra precautions, such as double gloving during delivery and surgical procedures, are recommended. Due to significant exposure of health-care personnel to hepatitis B, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2016a) recommend active and passive vaccination, described later. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C, so recommendations are for postexposure serosurveillance only.

Acute hepatitis has a case-fatality rate of 0.1 percent. For patients ill enough to be hospitalized, it may reach 1 percent. Most fatalities are due to fulminant hepatic necrosis, which in later pregnancy may resemble acute fatty liver. In these cases, hepatic encephalopathy is the usual presentation, and the mortality rate is 80 percent. Approximately half of patients with fulminant disease have hepatitis B infection, and co-infection with the delta agent is common.

The cardiovascular system is the system mainly affected in an individual who has lost a large quantity of blood. Arterial systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressures decrease, and the arterial pulse is rapid and feeble. The cutaneous veins collapse, and they fill slowly when compressed centrally. The skin is pale, moist, and slightly cyanotic. Respiration is rapid but may be shallow or deep.

Course of Arterial Blood Pressure Changes

Cardiac output decreases as a result of blood loss. The amount of blood removed when it is donated is approximately 10% of total blood volume; its removal is well tolerated, and mean arterial blood pressure changes little. This is not the case when greater amounts are lost from the circulation. The changes in Pa evoked by acute hemorrhage are illustrated in

Fig. 19.19 . If sufficient blood is rapidly withdrawn to decrease Pa to 50 mm Hg, the pressure then tends to rise spontaneously toward the control level over the next 20 or 30 minutes. In some individuals (curve A in

Fig.

19.20 ), this trend continues, and normal pressure is regained within a few hours. In others (curve B in

Fig. 19.20 ), the pressure rises initially after the cessation of hemorrhage. The pressure then begins to decline, and it continues to fall at an accelerating rate until death ensues. This progressive deterioration in cardiovascular function is termed hemorrhagic shock. At some time after the hemorrhage, the deterioration in the cardiovascular system becomes irreversible. A lethal outcome in patients with hemorrhagic shock can be prevented only temporarily by any known therapy, including massive transfusions of donor blood.

Patients can present with fatigue, malaise, nausea, vomiting, anorexic fever, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The most com-mon physical findings are jaundice and hepatomegaly. Because the disease is self-limited, the treatment is usually supportive. Patients who develop fulminant infection require aggressive therapy and should be transferred to a center capable of per-forming liver transplantation.Hepatitis B and C, on the other hand, can both lead to chronic liver

Decompensation may warrant balloon pericardiotomy and pericardial window.

Until recently, rheumatic fever (which affects the mitral valve more often than the aortic valve) was the most common cause of valvular heart disease in U.S. adults; the leading cause is now mechanical degeneration. Subtypes are listed in Table 2.1-18 along with their etiologies, presentation, diagnosis, and treatment.

Aortic aneurysms are most commonly associated with atherosclerosis. Most are abdominal, and > 90% originate below the renal arteries.

Usually asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on exam or radiologic study.

Risk factors include hypertension, high cholesterol, other vascular disease, a family history, smoking, gender (males > females), and age.

Exam demonstrates a pulsatile abdominal mass or abdominal bruits.

Ruptured aneurysm leads to hypotension and severe, tearing abdominal pain that radiates to the back.

Abdominal ultrasound for diagnosis or to follow an aneurysm over time. CT may be useful to determine the precise anatomy.

In asymptomatic patients, monitoring is appropriate for lesions < 5 cm.

Surgical repair is indicated if the lesion is > 5.5 cm (abdominal), > 6 cm (thoracic), or smaller but rapidly enlarging.

Emergent surgery for symptomatic or ruptured aneurysms.

A transverse tear in the intima of a vessel that results in blood entering the media, creating a false lumen and leading to a hematoma that propagates longitudinally. Most commonly 2° to hypertension. The most common sites of origin are above the aortic valve and distal to the left subclavian artery. Most often occurs at 40–60 years of age, with a greater frequency in males than in females.

Aortic aneurysm is most often associated with atherosclerosis, while aortic dissection is commonly linked to hypertension.

Substernal chest pain 2° to myocardial ischemia (O2 supply and demand mismatch). Prinzmetal’s (variant) angina mimics angina pectoris but is caused by vasospasm of coronary vessels. It classically affects young women at rest in the early morning and is associated with ST-segment elevation in the absence of cardiac enzyme elevation.

The classic triad consists of substernal chest pain or pressure (often described as a heaviness or pressure without pain), usually precipitated by stress or exertion and relieved by rest or nitrates.

Pain can radiate to the left arm, jaw, and neck and may be associated with shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, diaphoresis, or lightheadedness.

Examination of patients experiencing stable angina is generally unremarkable. Look for carotid and peripheral bruits suggesting atherosclerosis and hypertension.

Rule out pulmonary, GI, or other cardiac causes of chest pain.

Angina may be diagnosed from the history alone, but significant ST-segment changes on exercise stress test with ECG monitoring is diagnostic of CAD.

Women and diabetics classically experience “silent” ischemic events and present “atypically”; for this reason, it is necessary to maintain a high index of suspicion in this patient population.

Treat acute symptoms with ASA, O2 and/or IV nitroglycerin, and IV morphine, and consider IV β-blockers. The efficacy of nondihydropyridine CCBs (diltiazem, verapamil) and ACEIs has also been validated.

Patients with a suspected MI must be admitted and monitored until acute MI is ruled out by serial cardiac enzymes.

Treat chronic symptoms with nitrates, ASA, and β-blockers; CCBs are second-line agents for symptomatic control only.

Initiate risk factor reduction (e.g., smoking, cholesterol, hypertension). Hormone replacement therapy is not protective in postmenopausal women.

Women, diabetics, the elderly, and post–heart transplant patients may have atypical, clinically silent MIs.

History and Physical Examination The chest discomfort, often severe enough to be described as frank pain, is typically located in the sub-sternal region or sometimes in the epigastrium, and radiates to the left arm, left shoulder, and/or neck. Anginal “equivalents” such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension.

Electrocardiogram ST-segment depression occurs in 20 to 25% of patients; it may be transient in patients without biomarker evidence of myocardial necrosis, but may be persistent for several days in NSTEMI. T-wave changes are common but are less specific signs of ischemia, unless they are new and deep T-wave inversions (≥0.3 mV).

In the clinic

In emergency situations, when the airway is blocked above the level of the vocal folds, the median cricothyroid ligament can be perforated and a small tube inserted through the incision to establish an airway. Except for small vessels and the occasional presence of a pyramidal lobe of the thyroid gland, normally there are few structures between the median cricothyroid ligament and the skin.

In the clinic

A tracheostomy is a surgical procedure in which a hole is made in the trachea and a tube is inserted to enable ventilation.

A tracheostomy is typically performed when there is obstruction to the larynx as a result of inhalation of a foreign body, severe edema secondary to anaphylactic reaction, or severe head and neck trauma.

The typical situation in which a tracheostomy is performed is in the calm atmosphere of an operating theater. A small transverse incision is placed in the lower third of the neck anteriorly. The strap muscles are deviated laterally and the trachea can be easily visualized. Occasionally it is necessary to divide the isthmus of the thyroid gland. An incision is made in the second and third tracheal rings and a small tracheostomy tube inserted.

After the tracheostomy has been in situ for the required length of time, it is simply removed. The hole through which it was inserted almost inevitably closes without any intervention.

Patients with long-term tracheostomies are unable to vocalize because no air is passing through the vocal cords.

In the clinic

Laryngoscopy is a medical procedure that is used to inspect the larynx. The functions of laryngoscopy include the evaluation of patients with difficulty swallowing, assessment of the vocal cords, and assessment of the larynx for tumors, masses, and weak voice.

(BPH) refers to the histological findings of smooth muscle and fibroblast/epithelial cell pro-liferation in the transition zone of the prostate. Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) may be secondary to benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) causing progressive bladder outlet obstruc-tion but may also be due to numerous other conditions (e.g., urethral stricture, infection, overactive or neurogenic bladder, malignancy). Although some male patients with LUTS may have BPE, not all patients with an enlarged prostate have LUTS. The prevalence of LUTS attributed to BPH in men over the age of 50 is estimated at

Weight assessment can be challenging because normal weight range differs among indi- viduals, and different thresholds have been published defining thinness or underwzeight status. Body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight 1n kilograms /he1ght1n mezters 2') 1s a useful measure to assess body weight for height. For adults, a BMI of 18.5 kg/m 2has been employed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health

Organization (WHO) as the lower limit of2 normal body weight. Therefore, most adults with a BMI greater than or equal to 18.5 kg/m2 would not be considered tzo have a significantly low body weight. On the other hand, a BMI of lower than 17.0 kg/m 2has been considered by the WHO to indiczate moderate or severe thinness; therefore, an individual with a BMI less than 17. 0 kg/m 2would likely be considzered to have a significantly low weight An adult with a BMI between 17. 0 and 18.5 kg/mz, or even above 18.5 kg/m ,might be consid- ered to have a significantly low weight if clinical history or other physiological informa- tion supports this judgment.

For children and adolescents, determining a BMI-for-age percentile is useful (see, e.g., the CDC BMI percentile calculator for children and teenagers. As for adults, it is not pos- sible to provide definitive standards for judging whether a child’s or an adolescent’s weight is significantly low, and variations in developmental trajectories among youth limit the utility of simple numerical guidelines. The CDC has used a BMI-for-age below the 5th per- centile as suggesting underweight; however, children and adolescents with a BMI above this benchmark may be judged to be significantly underweight in light of failure to main- tain their expected growth trajectory. In summary, in determining whether Criterion A is met, the clinician should consider available numerical guidelines, as well as the individual’s body build, weight history, and any physiological disturbances.

Variability in body proportions occurs from fetal to adultlife. Newborns’ heads are significantly larger in proportion tothe rest of their body. This difference gradually disappears.Certain growth disturbances result in characteristic changesin the proportional sizes of the trunk, extremities, and head.Patterns requiring further assessment are summarized inTable 6-1.

Evaluating a child over time, coupled with a careful history and physical examination, helps determine whether the growth pattern is normal or abnormal. Parental heights may be useful when deciding whether to proceed with a further evaluation. Children, in general, follow their parents’ growth pattern, although there are many exceptions.

For a girl, midparental height is calculated as follows: −2.5 2

For a boy, midparental height is calculated as follows: +2.5 2

Actual growth depends on too many variables to makean accurate prediction from midparental height determination for every child. The growth pattern of a child with lowweight, length, and head circumference is commonly associated with familial short stature (see Chapter 173). Thesechildren are genetically normal but are smaller than most

Discrepant percentiles (e.g., weight 5th, length 5th, head circumference 50th, or other discrepancies)

Caloric insufficiency Midparental heights Thyroid hormone Growth factors, growth hormone testing Evaluation of pubertal children. A child who, by age, is preadolescent or adolescentand who starts puberty later than others may have the normal variant called constitutional short stature (see Chapter173); careful examination for abnormalities of pubertaldevelopment should be done, although most are normal. Anevaluation for primary amenorrhea should be consideredfor any female adolescent who has not reached menarche by15 years or has not done so within 3 years of thelarche. Lackof breast development by age 13 years also should be evaluated (see Chapter 174).

With regard to breast development (Fig. 29.3), Tanner stage 1 refers to the prepubertal state and includes no palpable breast tissue, with the areolae generally less than 2 cm in diameter. The nipples may be inverted, ﬂat, or raised. In Tanner stage 2, breast budding occurs, with a visible and palpable mound of breast tissue. The areolae begin to enlarge, the skin of the areolae thins, and the nipple develops to varying degrees. Tanner stage 3 is reﬂected by further growth and elevation of the entire breast. When the individual is seated and viewed from the side, the nipple is generally at or above the midplane of breast tissue. In most girls, Tanner stage 4 is defined by projection of the areola and papilla above the general breast contour in a secondary mound. Breast development is incomplete until Tanner stage 5, in which the breast is mature in contour and proportion. In most women, the nipple is more pigmented at this stage than earlier in

Anecdotal photographs and data such as these served to provide the basis for the theory that body fat, body mass, and menarche are linked. (From Wilkins L.

The nipple is generally below the midplane of breast tissue when the woman is seated and viewed from the side. Full breast development usually occurs over 3 to 3.5 years, but it may occur in as little as 2 years or not progress beyond stage 4 until the first pregnancy. Breast size is no indication of breast maturity.

Gait Disorder of Vestibulopathy

Patients with a chronic vestibulopathy show unsteadiness in standing and walking, often without widening their base, and an inability to descend stairs without holding onto the banister. They complain of a particular type of imbalance, usually with movement but at times when standing still—a sensation that may be likened to being on the deck of a rolling ship (mal de barquement). Running and turning quickly are even more impaired, with lurching in all directions. The patient has great difficulty in focusing his vision on a fixed target when he is moving or on a moving target when he is either stationary or moving. When the body is in motion or the head is moved suddenly, objects in the environment may appear momentarily blurred or actually jiggle up and down or from side to side (oscillopsia). Driving a car or reading on a train is difficult or impossible; even when walking, the patient may need to stop in order to read a sign. These abnormalities indicate a loss of stabilization of ocular fixation by the vestibular system during body movements (the vestibular-ocular reflex, or VOR). An elderly person has difficulty compensating for these abnormalities. Proof that the gait of such persons with vestibulopathy is dependent on visual clues comes from their performance blindfolded or in the dark, when their unsteadiness and staggering increase to the point of falling. When standing with eyes closed, they sway more than normal but generally do not fall over (i.e., they do not have a Romberg sign). The diagnosis is confirmed by testing labyrinthine function (caloric and rotational testing, electronystagmography, and posture platform testing).

Signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary depending on the infecting organism and the patient’s immune status. In typical pneumonias, the usual presentation is a patient with high fever, rigors, productive cough, chills, and pleuritic chest pain. Chest radiography often will show infiltrates (11). The following agents, listed in decreasing order, cause two-thirds of all bacterial pneumonias: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus inﬂuenza, Klebsiella pneumoniae, gram-negative organisms, and anaerobic bacteria. Atypical pneumonias are more insidious in onset than typical pneumonias. Patients have moderate fever without the characteristic rigors and chills. Additional symptoms include a nonproductive cough, headache, myalgias, and mild leukocytosis. Chest radiography reveals bronchopneumonia with a diffuse interstitial pattern; characteristically, the patient does not appear to be as ill as the x-ray suggests. Common causes of atypical pneumonia include viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia pneumoniae (also called the TWAR agent), and other rare agents.

A strong index of suspicion is required for diagnosis, especially in elderly and immunocompromised individuals, who have altered response mechanisms. This is true with “typical agents.” Subtle clues in the elderly include changes in mentation, confusion, and exacerbation of other illnesses. The febrile response may be entirely absent, and the results of the physical examination are not predictive of pneumonia. In high-risk groups, an increased respiratory rate of greater than 25 breaths per minute remains the most reliable sign of infection. Mortality in these high-risk groups of patients is strongly correlated with the ability of the host to mount normal defenses to the symptoms of fever, chills, and tachycardia.

All women suspected of having pneumonia should undergo chest radiography to establish the diagnosis and to detect alternate diagnoses such as congestive heart failure and tumors.

Pneumonia Pneumonia is the most common serious pneumococcal syndrome and is considered invasive when associated with a positive blood culture. Pneumococcal pneumonia can present as a mild community-acquired infection at one extreme and as a life-threatening disease requiring intubation and intensive support at the other.

presenting manifestations The presentation of pneumococcal pneumonia does not reliably distinguish it from pneumonia of other etiologies. In a subset of cases, pneumococcal pneumonia is recognized at the outset as associated with a viral upper respiratory infection and is characterized by the abrupt onset of cough and dyspnea accompanied by fever, shaking chills, and myalgias. The cough evolves from nonpurulent to productive of sputum that is purulent and sometimes tinged with blood. Patients may describe stabbing pleuritic chest pain and significant dyspnea indicating involvement of the parietal pleura. Among the elderly, the presenting clinical symptoms may be less specific, with confusion or malaise but without fever or cough. In such cases, a high index of suspicion is required because failure to treat pneumococcal pneumonia promptly in an elderly patient is likely to result in rapid evolution of the infection, with increased severity, morbidity, and risk of death.

findings on pHysical examination The clinical signs associated with pneumococcal pneumonia among adults include tachypnea (>30 breaths/min) and tachycardia, hypotension in severe cases, and fever in most cases (although not in all elderly patients). Respiratory signs are varied, including dullness to percussion in areas of the chest with significant consolidation, crackles on auscultation, reduced expansion of the chest in some cases as a result of splinting to reduce pain, bronchial breathing in a minority of cases, pleural rub in occasional cases, and cyanosis in cases with significant hypoxemia. Among infants with severe pneumonia, chest wall indrawing and nasal flaring are common. Nonrespiratory findings can include upper abdominal pain if the diaphragmatic pleura is involved as well as mental status changes, particularly confusion in elderly patients.

document (2) 

The patient is frequently febrile with tachycardia or may have a history of chills and/or sweats. Cough may be either nonproductive or productive of mucoid, purulent, or blood-tinged sputum. Gross hemoptysis is suggestive of CA-MRSA pneumonia. Depending on severity, the patient may be able to speak in full sentences or may be very short of breath. If the pleura is involved, the patient may experience pleuritic chest pain. Up to 20% of patients may have gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. Other symptoms may include fatigue, headache, myalgias, and arthralgias.

Findings on physical examination vary with the degree of pulmonary consolidation and the presence or absence of a significant pleural effusion. An increased respiratory rate and use of accessory muscles of respiration are common. Palpation may reveal increased or decreased tactile fremitus, and the percussion note can vary from dull to flat, reflecting underlying consolidated lung and pleural fluid, respectively. Crackles, bronchial breath sounds, and possibly a pleural friction rub may be heard on auscultation. The clinical presentation may not be so obvious in the elderly, who may initially display new-onset or worsening confusion and few other manifestations. Severely ill patients may have septic shock and evidence of organ failure.

When confronted with possible CAP, the physician must ask two questions: Is this pneumonia, and, if so, what is the likely etiology? The former question is typically answered by clinical and radiographic methods, whereas the latter requires the aid of laboratory techniques.

Clinical Diagnosis The differential diagnosis includes both infectious and noninfectious entities such as acute bronchitis, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and radiation pneumonitis. The importance of a careful history cannot be overemphasized. For example, known cardiac disease may suggest worsening pulmonary edema, while underlying carcinoma may suggest lung injury secondary to irradiation.

Influenza is most frequently described as a respiratory illness characterized by systemic symptoms, such as headache, feverishness, chills, myalgia, and malaise, as well as accompanying respiratory tract signs and symptoms, particularly cough and sore throat. In some cases, the onset is so abrupt that patients can recall the precise time they became ill. However, the spectrum of clinical presentations is wide, ranging from a mild, afebrile respiratory illness similar to the common cold (with either a gradual or an abrupt onset) to severe prostration with relatively few respiratory signs and symptoms. In most of the cases that

of the cases that come to a physician’s attention, the patient has a fever, with temperatures of 38°–41°C (100.4°–105.8°F). A rapid temperature rise within the first 24 h of illness is generally followed by gradual defervescence over 2–3 days, although, on occasion, fever may last as long as 1 week.

Examination of the chest includes inspection of the chest wall to identify asymmetry resulting from absence of the pectoralis muscle and inspection of the breast tissue to determine gestational age and detect a breast abscess. Boys and girls may have breast engorgement and produce milk; milk expression should not be attempted. Supernumerary nipples may be bilateral and may be associated with renal anomalies.

Examination of the lungs includes observations of the rate, depth, and nature of intercostal or sternal retractions. Breath sounds should be equal on both sides of the chest, and rales should not be heard after the first 1 to 2 hours of life. Diminished or absent breath sounds on one side suggest pneumothorax, collapsed lung, pleural effusion, or diaphragmatic hernia. Shift of the cardiac impulse away from a tension pneumothorax and diaphragmatic hernia and toward the collapsed lung is a helpful physical finding for differentiating these disorders. Subcutaneous emphysema of the neck or chest also suggests a pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum, whereas bowel sounds auscultated in the chest in the presence of a scaphoid abdomen suggest a diaphragmatic hernia.

The position of the heart in infants is more midline than in older children. The first heart sound is normal, whereas the second heart sound may not be split in the first day of life. Decreased splitting of the second heart sound is noted in PPHN, transposition of the great vessels, and pulmonary atresia. Heart murmurs in newborns are common in the delivery room and during the first day of life. Most of these murmurs are transient and are due to closure of the ductus arteriosus, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, or a small ventral septal defect. Pulses should be palpated in the upper and lower extremities (over the brachial and femoral arteries). Blood pressure in the upper and lower extremities should be measured in all patients with a murmur or heart failure. An upperto-lower extremity gradient of more than 10 to 20 mm Hg suggests coarctation of the aorta.

Raskin described a headache syndrome in older patients that shares with cluster headache a nocturnal occurrence (hypnic headache). It also may occur with daytime naps. However, it differs in being bilateral and unaccompanied by lacrimation and rhinorrhea. He has successfully treated a number of his patients with 300 mg of lithium carbonate or 75 mg of sustained-release indomethacin at bedtime. The nosologic position of this hypnic headache syndrome is undetermined.

Despite these considerations, the most hazardous cause of headache in the elderly is temporal (cranial) arteritis with or without polymyalgia rheumatica, as discussed further on.

The most common cause of generalized persistent headache, both in adolescents and adults, is probably mild depression or anxiety in one of its several forms. A small group of older patients has delusional symptoms involving pain and physical distortion of cranial structures. As the psychiatric symptoms subside, the headaches usually disappear. Odd cephalic pains, for example, a sensation of having a nail driven into the head (clavus hystericus), may occur in hysteria or psychosis and raise perplexing problems in diagnosis. The bizarre character of these pains, their persistence in the face of every known therapy, the absence of other signs of disease, and the presence of other manifestations of psychiatric disease provide the basis for correct diagnosis. Older children and adolescents sometimes have peculiar behavioral reactions to headache: screaming, looking dazed, clutching the head with an agonized look. Usually, migraine is the underlying disorder in these cases, the additional manifestations responding to therapeutic support and suggestion.

Migraine headaches are another common type of recurrent headaches and frequently begin in childhood. Headaches are stereotyped attacks of frontal, bitemporal, or unilateral, moderate to severe, pounding or throbbing pain that are aggravated by activity and last 1 to 72 hours. Associated symptoms include nausea, vomiting, pallor, photophobia, phonophobia, and an intense desire to seek a quiet dark room for rest. Toddlers may be unable to verbalize the source of their discomfort and exhibit episodes of irritability, sleepiness, pallor, and vomiting. Migraines can be associated with auras that may be typical (visual, sensory, dysphagic) or atypical. Aura can precede or coincide with the headache and typically persists for 15 to 30 minutes. Visual auras consist of spots, flashes, or lines of light that flicker in one or both visual fields. Atypical auras may also consist of brief episodes of unilateral or perioral

Acute: Single episode of pain without a history of such episodes. The “first and worst” headache, which raises concerns for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in adults, is commonly due to febrile illness related to upper respiratory tract infection in children. Regardless, more ominous causes of acute headache (hemorrhage, meningitis, tumor) must be considered.

Acute recurrent: Pattern of attacks of pain separated by symptom-free intervals. Primary headache syndromes, such as migraine or tension-type headache, usually cause this pattern. Infrequently recurrent headaches can sometimes also be attributed to certain epilepsy syndromes (benign occipital epilepsy), substance abuse, or recurrent trauma.

Chronic progressive: Most ominous of the temporal patterns— implies a gradually increasing frequency and severity of headache. The pathologic correlate is increasing ICP. Causes of this pattern include pseudotumor cerebri, brain tumor, hydrocephalus, chronic meningitis, brain abscess, and subdural collections.

This type of inflammatory disease of cranial arteries is an important cause of headache in older persons. All of our patients have been older than 55 years of age, most of them older than age 65. From a state of normal health, the patient develops an increasingly intense throbbing or nonthrobbing headache, often with superimposed sharp, stabbing pains. In a few patients the headache has had an almost explosive onset. The pain is usually unilateral, sometimes bilateral, and often localized to the site of the affected arteries in the scalp. The pain persists to some degree throughout the day and is particularly severe at night. It lasts for many months if untreated. The superficial temporal and other scalp arteries are frequently thickened and tender and without pulsation. Jaw claudication and ischemic nodules on the scalp, with ulceration of the overlying skin, have been described in severe cases.

Many of the patients feel generally unwell and have lost weight; some have a low-grade fever and anemia. Usually the sedimentation rate is greatly elevated (>50 mm/h and typically >75 mm/h) but elevation of the C-reactive protein (CRP) level is a more sensitive indicator of this inflammatory condition and is particularly helpful when the sedimentation rate is only mildly elevated. A few patients have a peripheral neutrophilic leukocytosis. Half of patients have generalized aching of proximal limb muscles, reflecting the presence of polymyalgia rheumatica (see Chap. 45, “Polymyalgia Rheumatica”). A relation of temporal arteritis to herpes zoster has been proposed.

The importance of early diagnosis relates to the threat of blindness from thrombosis of the ophthalmic or posterior ciliary arteries. This may be preceded by several episodes of amaurosis fugax (transient monocular blindness). Ophthalmoplegia may also occur but is less frequent, and its cause, whether neural or muscular, is not settled.

Migraine with Brainstem Aura (Basilar Migraine)

An uncommon form of the migraine syndrome with prominent premonitory brainstem symptoms was described by Bickerstaff. These patients, usually children with a family history of migraine, first develop visual phenomena like those of typical migraine except that they occupy much or the whole of both visual fields (temporary cortical blindness may occur). There may be associated vertigo, staggering, incoordination of the limbs, dysarthria, and tingling in both hands and feet, and sometimes around both sides of the mouth but curiously, rarely is there paralysis. These symptoms last 10 to 30 min and are followed by headache, which is usually occipital. Some patients, at the stage when the headache would have been likely to begin, may faint, and others become confused or stuporous, a state that may persist for several hours or longer. Exceptionally, there is an alarming period of coma or quadriplegia. The symptoms closely resemble those caused by ischemia in the territory of the basilar-posterior cerebral arteries—hence the name basilar, or vertebrobasilar migraine. Subsequent studies have indicated that basilar migraine, although more common in children and adolescents, affects men and women more or less equally over a wide age range, and that the condition is not always benign and transient because of rare instances with residual deficits.

The initial attack is not easily identifiable as a benign condition and various forms of imaging are reasonably performed in order to exclude basilar artery and upper brainstem disease. The issue of risk of causing stroke from the administration of intrarterial contrast is often raised and is unresolved. With recurrent similar attacks, the diagnosis becomes clearer and the use of imaging becomes less necessary.

Episodes of cyclic vomiting or periodic recurrent abdominal pain have been linked to migraine as a result of the frequent co-occurrence of these symptoms with headache or typical migraine at other times. Pallor, lethargy, and mild headache are common. This episodic disorder seems to be a problem almost exclusively of children. The results of diagnostic investigation are normal but one cannot be faulted for pursuing some form of testing with the initial occurrence of the syndrome.

TRANSIENT OR SuDDEN VISuAL LOSS Amaurosis Fugax This term refers to a transient ischemic attack of the retina (Chap. 446). Because neural tissue has a high rate of metabolism, interruption of blood flow to the retina for more than a few seconds results in transient monocular blindness, a term used interchangeably with amaurosis fugax. Patients describe a rapid fading of vision like a curtain descending, sometimes affecting only a portion of the visual field. Amaurosis fugax usually results from an embolus that becomes stuck within a retinal arteriole (Fig. 39-5). If the embolus breaks up or passes, flow is restored and vision returns quickly to normal without permanent damage. With prolonged interruption of blood flow, the inner retina suffers infarction. Ophthalmoscopy reveals zones of whitened, edematous retina following the distribution of branch retinal arterioles. Complete occlusion of the central retinal artery produces arrest of blood flow and a milky retina with a cherry-red fovea (Fig. 39-6). Emboli are composed of cholesterol (Hollenhorst plaque), calcium, or platelet-fibrin debris. The most common source is an atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid artery or aorta, although emboli also can arise from the heart, especially in patients with diseased valves, atrial fibrillation, or wall motion abnormalities.

Occurs when the iris dilates and pushes against the lens of the eye, disrupting ﬂow of aqueous humor into the anterior chamber. Pressure in the posterior chamber then pushes the peripheral iris forward and blocks the angle.

Risk factors include family history, older age, Asian ethnicity, hyperopia, prolonged pupillary dilation (prolonged time in a dark area, stress, medications), anterior uveitis, and lens dislocation.

Hx/PE: Classically presents with extreme eye pain, blurred vision, headache, nausea, and vomiting. A hard, red eye is seen (from acute closure of a narrow anterior chamber angle); the pupil is dilated and nonreactive to light. IOP is ↑. If it resolves spontaneously prior to presentation (e.g., with pupillary constriction in sunlight), ophthalmologic examination may reveal narrow angles in one or both eyes.

Dx: Diagnosis is based on clinical history and examination. Those that resolve may mimic a migraine headache with blurred vision; the distinction is that the headaches and blurred vision are more likely to be triggered by darkness (due to pupillary dilation) rather than by bright lights (migraine).

FIguRE 39-13 Optic disc drusen are calcified, mulberry-like deposits of unknown etiology within the optic disc, giving rise to “pseudopapilledema.” 204 scotomas from damage to the optic disc. With increasing age, drusen tend to become more exposed on the disc surface as optic atrophy develops. Hemorrhage, choroidal neovascular membrane, and AION are more likely to occur in patients with optic disc drusen. No treatment is available.

Vitreous Degeneration This occurs in all individuals with advancing age, leading to visual symptoms. Opacities develop in the vitreous, casting annoying shadows on the retina. As the eye moves, these distracting “floaters” move synchronously, with a slight lag caused by inertia of the vitreous gel. Vitreous traction on the retina causes mechanical stimulation, resulting in perception of flashing lights. This photopsia is brief and is confined to one eye, in contrast to the bilateral, prolonged scintillations of cortical migraine. Contraction of the vitreous can result in sudden separation from the retina, heralded by an alarming shower of floaters and photopsia. This process, known as vitreous detachment, is a common involutional event in the elderly. It is not harmful unless it damages the retina. A careful examination of the dilated fundus is important in any patient complaining of floaters or photopsia to search for peripheral tears or holes. If such a lesion is found, laser application can forestall a retinal detachment. Occasionally a tear ruptures a retinal blood vessel, causing vitreous hemorrhage and sudden loss of vision. On attempted ophthalmoscopy the fundus is hidden by a dark haze of blood. Ultrasound is required to examine the interior of the eye for a retinal tear or detachment. If the hemorrhage does not resolve spontaneously, the vitreous can be removed surgically. Vitreous hemorrhage also results from the fragile neovascular vessels that proliferate on the surface of the retina in diabetes, sickle cell anemia, and other ischemic ocular diseases.

Dx:

Acute peripheral vestibulopathy demonstrates the following:

An abnormal vestibulo-ocular reﬂex (VOR) as determined by a bedside head impulse test (i.e., rapid head rotation from lateral to center while staring at the examiner’s nose).

A predominantly horizontal nystagmus that always beats in one direction, opposite the lesion.

No vertical eye misalignment by alternate cover testing.

If patients are “high risk” (i.e., if they have atypical eye findings or any neurologic symptoms or signs, cannot stand independently, have head or neck pain, are > 50 years of age, or have one or more stroke risk factors), they should be imaged by MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging.

For low-risk patients, consider caloric testing as ancillary support for the diagnosis.

Labyrinthitis (with auditory symptoms) is mimicked by lateral pontine/ cerebellar stroke (AICA arterial territory). Vestibular neuritis (without auditory symptoms) is mimicked by lateral medullary/cerebellar stroke (PICA arterial territory).

Tx: Acute treatment consists of corticosteroids given < 72 hours after symptom onset and vestibular sedatives (e.g., meclizine). The condition usually subsides spontaneously within weeks to months. Once the hyperacute stage has passed, cautious engagement in normal physical activities and exercise should be encouraged.

A cause of recurrent vertigo with auditory symptoms that affects at least 1 in 500 in the United States. More common among females.

Hx/PE: Presents with recurrent episodes of severe vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, or ear fullness, often lasting hours to days. Nausea and vomiting are typical. Patients progressively lose low-frequency hearing over years and may become deaf on the affected side.

Mothers who breastfeed experience both shortand longterm health benefits. Decreased risk of postpartum hemorrhages, more rapid uterine involution, longer period of amenorrhea, and decreased postpartum depression have been observed. Similarly, there is an association between a long lactation of 12 to 23 months (cumulative lactation of all pregnancies) and a significant reduction of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes in the mother. Cumulative lactation of more than 12 months also correlates with reduced risk of ovarian and breast cancer.

Adequacy of milk intake can be assessed by voidingand stooling patterns of the infant. A well-hydrated infantvoids six to eight times a day. Each voiding should soak, notmerely moisten, a diaper, and urine should be colorless. By5 to 7 days, loose yellow stools should be passed at least fourtimes a day. Rate of weight gain provides the most objectiveindicator of adequate milk intake. Total weight loss after birthshould not exceed 7%, and birth weight should be regained by10 days. The mean feeding frequency during the early weekspostpartum is 8 to 12 times per day. An infant may be adequately hydrated while not receiving enough milk to achieveadequate energy and nutrient intake. Telephone follow-up isvaluable during the interim between discharge and the firstdoctor visit to monitor the progress of lactation. A follow-upvisit should be scheduled by 3 to 5 days of age, and again by 2 weeks of age.

In 2016, 81 percent of U.S. newborns were initially breastfed, 52 percent were still breastfed at 6 months, and 31 percent at 1 year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016). According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017 e), exclusive breastfeeding is preferred until 6 months. In many hospitals, breastfeeding begins in the delivery room. Most term newborns thrive best when fed 8 to 12 times daily for approximately 15 minutes each episode. Preterm or growth-restricted newborns require feedings at shorter intervals. Breastfeeding is discussed further in Chapter 36 (p. 656).

Because most neonates actually receive little nutriment for the first 3 or 4 days of life, they progressively lose weight until the flow of maternal milk is established or other feeding is instituted. Preterm neonates lose relatively more weight and regain their birthweight more slowly. Conversely, growth-restricted but otherwise healthy newborns regain their initial weight more quickly than those born preterm. With proper nourishment, birthweight of term newborns usually is regained by 10 days.

For the irst 2 or 3 days after birth, the colon contains sot, brown-green meconium. his consists of desquamated epithelial cells from the intestinal tract, mucus, epidermal cells, and lanugo (fetal hair) that have been swallowed along with amnionic luid.

The characteristic color results from bile pigments. During fetal life and for a few hours after birth, the intestinal contents are sterile, but bacteria quickly colonize the bowel contents.

Meconium stooling is seen in 90 percent of newborns within the irst 24 hours, and most of the rest within 36 hours. Usually, newborns irst void shortly ater birth but may not until the second day. Meconium and urine passage indicates patency of the gastro intestinal and urinary tracts, respectively. Failure of the newborn to stool or urinate ater these times suggests a congenital defect, such as Hirschsprung disease, imperforate anus, or posterior urethral valve. Ater the third or fourth day, as a result of milk ingestion, meconium is replaced by light-yellow, soter, homogenous feces.

• Care of Breasts

The nipples require little attention other than cleanliness and attention to skin issures. Fissured nipples render nursing painful, and they may have a deleterious influence on milk production. These cracks also provide a portal of entry for pyogenic bacteria. Because dried milk is likely to accumulate and irritate the nipples, washing the areola with water and mild soap is helpful before and ater nursing. When the nipples are irritated or fissured, some recommend topical lanolin and a nipple shield for 24 hours or longer. Although specific evidence supporting this practice is lacking, nipple pain usually subsides by 10 days (Dennis, 2014). If issuring is severe, the newborn should not be permitted to nurse on the afected side. Instead, the breast is emptied regularly with a pump until the lesions are healed. Poor latching of the neonate to the breast can create such issures. For example, the newborn may take into its mouth only the nipple, which is then is forced against the hard palate during suckling. Ideally, the nipple and areola are both taken in to evenly distribute suckling forces. Moreover, the force of the hard palate against the lactiferous sinuses aids their eicient emptying, while the nipple is thereby positioned closer to the soft palate.

Critically ill patients with alcoholic hepatitis have short-term (30-day) mortality rates >50%. Severe alcoholic hepatitis is heralded by coagulopathy (prothrombin time increased >5 s), anemia, serum albumin concentrations <25 g/L (2.5 mg/dL), serum bilirubin levels >137 μmol/L (8 mg/dL), renal failure, and ascites. A discriminant function calculated as 4.6 X (the prolongation of the prothrombin time above control [seconds]) + serum bilirubin (mg/dL) can identify patients with a poor prognosis (discriminant function >32). A Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score (Chap. 368) ≥21 also is associated with significant mortality in alcoholic hepatitis. The presence of ascites, variceal hemorrhage, deep encephalopathy, or hepatorenal syndrome predicts a dismal prognosis. The pathologic stage of the injury can be helpful in predicting prognosis. Liver biopsy should be performed whenever possible to establish the diagnosis and to guide the therapeutic decisions.

Laboratory Features The serum aminotransferases aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (previously designated SGOT and SGPT) increase to a variable degree during the prodromal phase of acute viral hepatitis and precede the rise in bilirubin level (Figs. 360-2 and 360-4). The level of these enzymes, however, does not correlate well with the degree of liver cell damage. Peak levels vary from 400–4000 IU or more; these levels are usually reached at the time the patient is clinically icteric and diminish progressively during the recovery phase of acute hepatitis. The diagnosis of anicteric hepatitis is based on clinical features and on aminotransferase elevations.

Jaundice is usually visible in the sclera or skin when the serum bilirubin value is >43 μmol/L (2.5 mg/dL). When jaundice appears, the serum bilirubin typically rises to levels ranging from 85–340 μmol/L (5–20 mg/dL). The serum bilirubin may continue to rise despite falling serum aminotransferase levels. In most instances, the total bilirubin is equally divided between the conjugated and unconjugated fractions. Bilirubin levels >340 μmol/L (20 mg/dL) extending and persisting late into the course of viral hepatitis are more likely to be associated with severe disease. In certain patients with underlying hemolytic anemia, however, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and sickle cell anemia, a high serum bilirubin level is common, resulting from superimposed hemolysis. In such patients, bilirubin levels >513 μmol/L (30 mg/dL) have been observed and are not necessarily associated with a poor prognosis.

Laboratory features of chronic hepatitis B do not distinguish adequately between histologically mild and severe hepatitis. Aminotransferase elevations tend to be modest for chronic hepatitis B but may fluctuate in the range of 100−1000 units. As is true for acute viral hepatitis B, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) tends to be more elevated than aspartate aminotransferase (AST); however, once cirrhosis is established, AST tends to exceed ALT. Levels of alkaline phosphatase activity tend to be normal or only marginally elevated. In severe cases, moderate elevations in serum bilirubin (51.3−171 μmol/L [3−10 mg/

This term is a misnomer, how-ever, because most of these tests measure not liver function but rather cell damage.

the patient’s cardiovascular status can be obtained by palpating peripheral pulses. In gen-eral, systolic blood pressure (SBP) must be 60 mmHg for the carotid pulse to be palpable, 70 mmHg for the femoral pulse, and  80 mmHg for the radial pulse. Any episode of hypotension (defined as a SBP <90 mmHg) is assumed to be caused by hem-orrhage until proven otherwise. Patients with rapid massive blood loss may have paradoxical bradycardia.13 Blood pressure and pulse should be measured at least every 5 minutes in patients with significant blood loss until normal vital sign

Testing of Blood Pressure and Heart Rate

These are among the simplest and most important tests of autonomic function and most laboratories have automated techniques to quantitate them. McLeod and Tuck state that in changing from the recumbent to the standing position, a fall of more than 30 mm Hg systolic and 15 mm Hg diastolic is abnormal; others give figures of 20 and 10 mm Hg. They caution that the arm on which the cuff is placed must be held horizontally when standing, so that the decline in arm pressure will not be obscured by the added hydrostatic pressure. As emphasized in Chap. 17 on syncope, the determination of blood pressure in orthostatic testing is ideally done by having the patient remain supine for as long as it is practical before testing, and shifting from a supine to standing position, without the interposition of sitting. Moreover, blood pressure is most informative if measured immediately after standing and again at approximately 1 and 3 min. The expected response is a momentary and slight increase in pressure that is usually not detected with a manual blood pressure cuff, followed by a slight drop within seconds of standing, and then a slow recovery during the first minute. Persistent hypotension at 1 min indicates sympathetic adrenergic failure and the later measurement affirms this if blood pressure fails to recover or continues to decline (Fig. 25-5).

The cardiovascular system is the system mainly affected in an individual who has lost a large quantity of blood. Arterial systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressures decrease, and the arterial pulse is rapid and feeble. The cutaneous veins collapse, and they fill slowly when compressed centrally. The skin is pale, moist, and slightly cyanotic. Respiration is rapid but may be shallow or deep.

Course of Arterial Blood Pressure Changes

Cardiac output decreases as a result of blood loss. The amount of blood removed when it is donated is approximately 10% of total blood volume; its removal is well tolerated, and mean arterial blood pressure changes little. This is not the case when greater amounts are lost from the circulation. The changes in Pa evoked by acute hemorrhage are illustrated in

Fig. 19.19 . If sufficient blood is rapidly withdrawn to decrease Pa to 50 mm Hg, the pressure then tends to rise spontaneously toward the control level over the next 20 or 30 minutes. In some individuals (curve A in

Fig.

19.20 ), this trend continues, and normal pressure is regained within a few hours. In others (curve B in

Fig. 19.20 ), the pressure rises initially after the cessation of hemorrhage. The pressure then begins to decline, and it continues to fall at an accelerating rate until death ensues. This progressive deterioration in cardiovascular function is termed hemorrhagic shock. At some time after the hemorrhage, the deterioration in the cardiovascular system becomes irreversible. A lethal outcome in patients with hemorrhagic shock can be prevented only temporarily by any known therapy, including massive transfusions of donor blood.

Alcohol consumption, psychosocial stress, and low levels of physical activity also may contribute to hypertension. Adoption, twin, and family studies document a significant heritable component to blood pressure levels and hypertension. Family studies controlling for a common environment indicate that blood pressure heritabilities are in the range 15–35%. In twin studies, heritability estimates of blood pressure are ~60% for males and 30–40% for females.

Anteroposterior and frog-leg radiographs of the hip are usually normal. Ultrasonography may reveal a joint effusion. It is mandatory to rule out septic arthritis in the presence of effusion with a joint aspiration and cell count.

The mainstay of treatment is bed rest and minimal weight bearing until the pain resolves. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication is usually sufficient to decrease pain. Limiting strenuous activity and exercise for 1 to 2 weeks following recovery is helpful. Follow-up will help ensure that there is no deterioration. Lack of improvement necessitates further evaluation for more serious disorders.

Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCPD) is idiopathic avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis) of the capital epiphysis of the femoral head. The etiology is unclear, but it is likely caused by an interruption of the blood supply to the capital femoral epiphysis. There may be an associated hypercoagulability state (factor V Leiden).

LCPD commonly presents in patients 3 to 12 years of age, with a mean age of 7 years. It is four to five times more common in boys.

Patients may not present for several weeks because of minimaldiscomfort; the classic presentation is a child with an atraumatic, painless limp. There may be mild or intermittent hip/groin, anterior thigh, or knee pain. Decreased internal rotationand abduction with some discomfort, thigh muscle spasm, andanterior thigh muscular atrophy may be present. Patients havedelayed bone age.

FIGURE 157-1 Acute septic arthritis of the sternoclavicular joint.

A man in his forties with a history of cirrhosis presented with a new onset of fever and lower neck pain. He had no history of IV drug use or previous catheter placement. Jaundice and a painful swollen area over his left sternoclavicular joint were evident on physical examination. Cultures of blood drawn at admission grew group B Streptococcus. The patient recovered after treatment with IV penicillin. (Courtesy of Francisco M. Marty, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston; with permission.) common among patients with rheumatoid arthritis and may resemble a flare of the underlying disease.

The usual presentation consists of moderate to severe pain that is uniform around the joint, effusion, muscle spasm, and decreased range of motion. Fever in the range of 38.3–38.9°C (101–102°F) and sometimes higher is common but may not be present, especially in persons with rheumatoid arthritis, renal or hepatic insufficiency, or conditions requiring immunosuppressive therapy. The inflamed, swollen joint is usually evident on examination except in the case of a deeply situated joint such as the hip, shoulder, or sacroiliac joint. Cellulitis, bursitis, and acute osteomyelitis, which may produce a similar clinical picture, should be distinguished from septic arthritis by their greater range of motion and less-than-circumferential swelling. A focus of extraarticular infection, such as a boil or pneumonia, should be sought. Peripheral-blood leukocytosis with a left shift and elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein level are common.

Plain radiographs show evidence of soft-tissue swelling, joint-space widening, and displacement of tissue planes by the distended capsule. Narrowing of the joint space and bony erosions indicate advanced infection and a poor prognosis. Ultrasound is useful for detecting effusions in the hip, and CT or MRI can demonstrate infections of the sacroiliac joint, the sternoclavicular joint, and the spine very well.

Elongation of the nerve root by straight-leg raising or by flexing the leg at the hip and extending it at the knee (Lasègue maneuver discussed earlier) is the most consistent of all pain-provoking signs. During straight-leg raising, the patient can distinguish between the discomfort of ordinary tautness of the hamstring and the sharper, less-familiar root pain, particularly when asked to compare the experience with that on the normal side. Many variations of the Lasègue maneuver have been described (with numerous eponyms), the most useful of which is accentuation of the pain by dorsiflexion of the foot (Bragard sign) or of the great toe (Sicard sign). The Lasègue maneuver with the healthy leg may evoke sciatic pain on the contralateral side), but usually of lesser degree (Fajersztajn sign). However, the presence of the “crossed straight-leg-raising sign” is highly indicative of a ruptured disc as the cause of sciatica (Hudgkins). With the patient standing, forward bending of the trunk will cause flexion of the knee on the affected side (Neri sign). Sciatica may be provoked by forced flexion of the head and neck, coughing, or pressure on both jugular veins, all of which increase the intraspinal pressure (Naffziger sign). Marked inconsistencies in response to these tests raise the suspicion of psychologic factors or of referred muscular pain.

An antalgic posture, referred to as sciatic scoliosis, is maintained by reflex contraction of the paraspinal muscles, which can be both seen and palpated. In walking, the knee is slightly flexed, and weight bearing on the painful leg is brief and cautious on the ball of the foot, giving a limp. It is particularly painful for the patient to go up and down stairs.

The signs of more severe spinal root compression are impairment of sensation, loss or diminution of tendon reflexes, and muscle weakness, as summarized in

Table 10-1.

and markedly decreased range of movement. The onset may be sudden or insidious with symptoms noted when the joint is moved only, such as during a diaper change, or if parents become aware of decreased voluntary movement of a joint or limb. Toddlers may exhibit a limp or refuse to walk. In septic arthritis of the hip, the lower limb may be preferentially held in external rotation and flexion to minimize pain from pressure on the joint capsule. Similarly the knee and elbow joints usually are held in flexion. The joints of the lower extremity are most often involved: the knees (40%), the hips (20%), and the ankles (14%). Small joints, such as those of the hand, usually are involved after penetrating trauma or closed fist injuries.

Minor genital tract symptoms that have been ignored may precede development of the early arthritis-dermatitis syndrome associated with disseminated gonococcal infection. A history of febrile illness antedating the development of monarticular arthritis characterizes late gonococcal arthritis.

Reactive arthritis is typically symmetric, polyarticular, and usually involves the large joints, especially the hips. Patients may have had a preceding episode of gastroenteritis or urethritis. Urethritis may appear with the arthritis.

Leukocytosis and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are common. Arthrocentesis is important to distinguish among the causes of arthritis (Table 118-2). Adolescents with acute infectious arthritis should have urethral, cervical, rectal, and pharyngeal examinations and cultures or nucleic acid amplification tests performed for Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

excess results from an increase in the secretion of estradiol by the testicles or by nontesticular tumors, nutri-tional alterations such as protein and fat deprivation, endocrine disorders (hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism), and hepatic dis-ease (nonalcoholic and alcoholic cirrhosis). Refeeding gyne-comastia is related to the resumption of pituitary gonadotropin secretion after pituitary shutdown. Androgen deficiency may initiate gynecomastia.

Mammography and ultrasonography are used to differentiate breast tissues. Dominant masses or areas of firmness, irregular-ity, and asymmetry suggest the possibility of a breast cancer, particularly in the older male. Gynecomastia generally does not predispose the male breast to cancer. However, the hypoandro-genic state of Klinefelter’s syndrome (XXY), in which gyneco-mastia is usually evident, is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Gynecomastia

in the elderly; some of these drugs are listed in Table 60–2. The greatest changes are in phase I reactions, ie, those carried out by microsomal P450 systems. There are much smaller changes in the ability of the liver to carry out conjugation (phase II) reactions (see Chapter 4). Some of these changes may be caused by decreased liver blood flow (Table 60–1), an important variable in the clearance of drugs that have a high hepatic extraction ratio. In addition, there is a decline with age of the liver’s ability to recover from injury, eg, that caused by alcohol or viral hepatitis. Therefore, a history of recent liver disease in an older person should lead to caution in dosing with drugs that are cleared primarily by the liver, even after apparently complete recovery from the hepatic insult. Finally, malnutrition and diseases that affect hepatic function—eg, heart failure—are more common in the elderly. Heart failure may dramatically alter the ability of the liver to metabolize drugs by reducing hepatic blood flow. Similarly, severe nutritional deficiencies, which occur more often in old age, may impair hepatic function.

HEV is an enterically transmitted, water-borne infection that usually produces a self-limiting disease. The virus typically infects young to middle-aged adults. HEV is a zoonotic disease with animal reservoirs that include monkeys, cats, pigs, and dogs. Epidemics have been reported in Asia and the Indian subcontinent, sub-Saharan Africa, and Mexico, and sporadic cases are seen in Western nations, particularly where pig farming is common and in travelers returning from regions of high incidence. Of greater importance, HEV infection accounts for 30% to 60% of cases of sporadic acute hepatitis in India, exceeding the frequency of HAV. A characteristic feature of HEV infection is the high mortality rate among pregnant women, approaching 20%. In most cases, HEV is not associated with chronic liver disease or persistent viremia. The average incubation period following exposure is 4 to 5 weeks.

http://ebooksmedicine.net

Discovered in 1983, HEV is an unenveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus in the Hepevirus genus. Virions are shed in stool during the acute illness. Before the onset of clinical illness, HEV RNA and HEV virions can be detected by PCR in stool and serum. The onset of rising serum aminotransferases, clinical illness, and elevated IgM anti-HEV titers are virtually simultaneous. Symptoms resolve in 2 to 4 weeks, during which time the IgM titers fall and IgG anti-HEV titers rise.

Cough results from stimulation of irritant receptors in the airway mucosa. Acute cough generally is associated with respiratory infections or irritant exposure (smoke) and subsides as the infection resolves or the exposure is eliminated. The characteristics of the cough and the circumstances under which the cough occurs help in determining the cause. Sudden onset after a choking episode suggests foreign body aspiration. Morning cough may be due to the accumulation of excessive secretions during the night from sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, or bronchial infection. Nighttime coughing is a hallmark of asthma and can also be caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease. Cough exacerbated by lying flat may be due to postnasal drip, sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, or reflux. Recurrent coughing with exercise is suggestive of exercise-induced asthma/bronchospasm. Paroxysmal cough suggests pertussis or foreign body aspiration. A repetitive, staccato cough occurs in chlamydial infections in infants. A harsh, brassy, seal-like cough suggests croup, tracheomalacia, or psychogenic (habit) cough. The last, which is most common in teenagers, disappears during sleep. Younger children can develop a throat-clearing habit cough, which also disappears during sleep.

asthma and allergy. Exacerbating factors include viral infections, exposure to allergens and irritants (e.g., smoke, strong odors, fumes), exercise, emotions, and change in weather/humidity. Nighttime symptoms are common. Rhinosinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (especially aspirin) can aggravate asthma. Treatment of these conditions may lessen the frequency and severity of the asthma.

During acute episodes, tachypnea, tachycardia, cough, wheezing, and a prolonged expiratory phase may be present. Physical findings may be subtle. Classic wheezing may not be prominent if there is poor air movement from airway obstruction. As the attack progresses, cyanosis, diminished air movement, retractions, agitation, inability to speak, tripod sitting position, diaphoresis, and pulsus paradoxus (decrease in blood pressure of >15 mm Hg with inspiration) may be observed. Physical examination may show evidence of other atopic diseases such as eczema or allergic rhinitis.

Objective measurements of pulmonary function (spirometry) help establish the diagnosis and direct the treatment of asthma. Spirometry is used to monitor response to treatment, assess degree of reversibility with therapeutic intervention, and measure the severity of an asthma exacerbation. Children older than 5 years of age can perform spirometry maneuvers. Variability in predicted peak flow reference values make spirometry preferred to peak flow measures in the diagnosis of asthma. For younger children who cannot perform spirometry maneuvers or peak flow, a therapeutic trial of controller medications helps in the diagnosis of asthma.

Sinus ailments frequently occur in middle-age individuals. Acute infection is usually located in the maxillary and frontal sinuses. Classically, infection in the maxillary sinus results from obstruction of the ostia found in the medial wall of the nose. Fever, malaise, a vague headache, and pain in the maxillary teeth are early symptoms. Reports of “fullness” in the face or exploding pressure behind the eyes often are elicited as well as increasing pain with bending over. Pressure and percussion over the malar areas can cause severe pain. Purulent exudates in the middle meatus of the nose or

common colds per year, with the most affected being younger children and children attending day care. Infection is suggested by the presence of sore throat, fever, and poor appetite, especially with a history of exposure to others with colds. Chronic infectious rhinosinusitis, or sinusitis, should be suspected if there is mucopurulent nasal discharge with symptoms that persist beyond 10 days (see Chapter 104). Classic signs of acute sinusitis in older children include facial tenderness, tooth pain, headache, and fever.

Five clinical findings are most useful in diagnosis: (i) maxillary toothache, (ii) poor response to nasal decongestants, (iii) abnormal transillumination, (iv) colored visible purulent nasal secretions, and (v) a history of colored nasal discharge. When four or more features are present, the likelihood of sinusitis is high, and when none is present, sinusitis is highly unlikely (2).

Rhinitis can be divided into allergic and nonallergic rhinitis (Table 79-1). Nonallergic rhinitis describes a group of nasal diseases in which there is no evidence of allergic etiology. It can be divided further into nonanatomic and anatomic etiologies. The most common form of nonallergic rhinitis in children is infectious rhinitis, which may be acute or chronic. Acute infectious rhinitis (the common cold) is caused by viruses, including rhinoviruses and coronaviruses, and typically resolves within 7 to 10 days (see Chapter 102).

Chronic bronchitis is diagnosed on clinical grounds: it is defined by the presence of a persistent productive cough for at least 3 consecutive months in at least 2 consecutive years. It is common among cigarette smokers and urban dwellers in smog-ridden cities; some studies indicate that 20% to 25% of men in the 40to 65-year-old age group have the disease. In early stages of the disease, the cough raises mucoid sputum, but airflow is not obstructed. Some patients with chronic bronchitis have evidence of hyperresponsive airways, with intermittent bronchospasm and wheezing (asthmatic bronchitis), while other bronchitic patients, especially heavy smokers, develop chronic outflow obstruction, usually with associated emphysema (COPD).

The distinctive feature of chronic bronchitis is hypersecretion of mucus, beginning in the large airways.

Central respiratory depression (e.g., anesthesia, sedation, or coma) 244 few minutes, is productive of benign-appearing mucoid sputum, and generally does not cause discomfort. Cough may occur in the context of other respiratory symptoms that together point to a diagnosis; for example, cough accompanied by wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness after exposure to a cat or other sources of allergens suggests asthma. At times, however, cough is the dominant or sole symptom of disease, and it may be of sufficient duration and severity that relief is sought. The duration of cough is a clue to its etiology. Acute cough (<3 weeks) is most commonly due to a respiratory tract infection, aspiration, or inhalation of noxious chemicals or smoke. Subacute cough (3–8 weeks in duration) is a common residuum of tracheobronchitis, as in pertussis or “postviral tussive syndrome.” Chronic cough (>8 weeks) may be caused by a wide variety of cardiopulmonary diseases, including those of inflammatory, infectious, neoplastic, and cardiovascular etiologies. When initial assessment with chest examination and radiography is normal, cough-variant asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, nasopharyngeal drainage, and medications (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) are the most common causes of chronic cough.

Details as to the sound, the time of occurrence during the day, and the pattern of coughing infrequently provide useful etiologic clues. Regardless of cause, cough often worsens upon first lying down at night, with talking, or with the hyperpnea of exercise; it frequently improves with sleep. An exception may involve the cough that occurs only with certain allergic exposures or exercise in cold air, as in asthma. Useful historical questions include what circumstances surround the onset of cough, what makes the cough better or worse, and whether or not the cough produces sputum.

Chronic Obstructive COPD is the greatest risk factor for the development of postoperative pulmonary com-Pulmonary Disease plications. COPD encompasses both chronic bronchitis and emphysema, disease entities that often occur in tandem. Cigarette smoke is implicated in the pathogenesis of both, and any treatment plan must include cessation of smoking (242). Chronic bronchitis is defined as the presence of productive cough on most days for at least 3 months per year and for at least 2 successive years (243). It is characterized by chronic airway inﬂammation and excessive mucus production. The histologic changes of emphysema include destruction of alveolar septa and distension of airspaces distal to terminal alveoli. The destruction of alveoli results in air trapping, loss of pulmonary elastic recoil, collapse of the airways in expiration, increased work of breathing, and significant ventilation-perfusion mismatching (243). The impaired ability to cough effectively and clear secretions predisposes patients with COPD to atelectasis and pneumonia in the postoperative period.

Patients with COPD and a history of heavy smoking account for most postoperative pulmonary complications in gynecologic surgical patients. The severity of COPD can be determined preoperatively via a thorough history and physical examination. According to recommendations regarding the use of preoperative pulmonary function tests by the American College of Physicians, these should be reserved for individuals in whom COPD is suspected, but unconfirmed (237,241). Typically, patients with COPD demonstrate impaired expiratory air ﬂow, manifested by diminished FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC).

Data suggest that arterial blood gas measurements may show varying degrees of hypoxemia and hypercapnia: routine use of preoperative arterial blood gas measurement does not stratify patients into a higher risk subset for postoperative complications (236).

Exhalation during normal breathing is passive, but it becomes active during exercise and hyperventilation. The most important muscles of exhalation are those of the abdominal wall (rectus abdominis, internal and external oblique, and transversus abdominis) and the internal intercostal muscles, which oppose the external intercostal muscles (i.e., they pull the ribs downward and inward). The inspiratory muscles do the work of breathing. During normal breathing, this workload is low, and the inspiratory muscles have significant reserve. Respiratory muscles can be trained to do more work, but there is a limit to the work that they can perform. Respiratory muscle weakness can impair movement of the chest wall, and respiratory muscle fatigue is a major factor in the development of respiratory failure.

Lung Embryology, Development, Aging, and Repair

The epithelium of the lung arises as a pouch from the primitive foregut at approximately 22 to 26 days after fertilization of the ovum. This single lung bud branches into primitive right and left lungs. Over the next 2 to 3 weeks, further branching occurs to create the irregular dichotomous branching pattern. The pathologist Lynne Reid described “three laws of lung development”: (1) The bronchial tree has developed by week 16 of intrauterine

2023-11-29 14:13:42,494 query: A 22-year-old woman presents to the emergency department for abdominal pain. The patient has been trying to get pregnant and was successful recently, but now she is experiencing abdominal pain, contractions, and a bloody vaginal discharge. According to her last appointment with her primary care provider, she is 10 weeks pregnant. The patient has a past medical history of constipation, anxiety, and substance abuse. She is not currently taking any medications. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 107/58 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a bloody vaginal discharge and an open cervix. The patient is initially extremely grateful for the care she is receiving and thanks the doctor and the nursing staff for saving her baby. Upon hearing the news that she is having a spontaneous abortion, the patient becomes angry and aggressive and states that her physician and the medical staff are incompetent, evil, and she is going to sue all of them. The patient is left to grieve but upon entering the room again you notice that the patient has new lacerations over her wrists and that some of the medical equipment in the room is broken.

Incomplete Abortion An incomplete abortion is a partial expulsion of the pregnancy tissue. Although most patients have vaginal bleeding, only some have passed tissue. Lower abdominal cramping is invariably present, and the pain may be described as resembling labor. On physical examination, the cervix is dilated and effaced, and bleeding is present. Often, clots are admixed with products of conception. If the bleeding is profuse, the patient should be examined promptly for tissue protruding from the cervical os; removal of this tissue with a ring forceps may reduce the bleeding. A vasovagal bradycardia may occur and responds to removal of the tissue. A complete blood count, maternal blood type, and Rh determination should be obtained; Rh-negative patients should receive RhoGAM. If the patient is febrile, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy should be administered.

Management of Spontaneous Abortion

In women with stable vital signs and mild vaginal bleeding, three management options exist: expectant management, medical treatment, and suction curettage. Despite a wide range (25% to 76%) of success cited in the literature, expectant management may remain a desirable option for a stable and carefully counseled patient (23,24). Medical management with 800 μgof misoprostol placed vaginally can be up to 84% effective in achieving complete abortion (25). For incomplete abortion, the misoprostol dose can be reduced to 600 μg orally or 400 μg sublingually, with efficacy greater than 90% (26). Suction curettage should be performed in women with excessive bleeding, unstable vital signs, or in whom reliable follow-up is a concern.

Cervical lacerations are not usually problematic unless they cause hemorrhage or extend to the vagina. Rarely, the cervix may be entirely or partially avulsed from the vagina in the anterior, posterior, or lateral fornices, an injury termed coporrhxis. Another rare injury is when the entire vaginal portion of the cervix is avulsed-annular or circular detachment. These injuries sometimes follow forceps deliveries performed through an incompletely dilated cervix with the blades applied over the cer vix. In some women, cervical tears reach into the lower uterine segment and involve the uterine artery and its major branches. They occasionally extend into the peritoneal cavity. More severe lacerations usually manifest as external hemorrhage or as a hematoma, however, they may occasionally be unsuspected. In the Israeli study just cited, almost 11 percent of women with a cervical laceration required blood transfusions (Melamed, 2009).

At times, the edematous anterior cervical lip is compressed berween the fetal head and maternal symphysis pubis. This usually is of little consequence and resolves spontaneously. Rarely, this causes severe ischemia, and the anterior lip may undergo necrosis and subsequently separate from the rest of the cervix.

As with vulvovaginal lacerations, cervical tears can be more fully appreciated with adequate exposure, which may be best attained with transfer to an operating room. An assistant applies irm downward pressure on the uterus, while the operator exerts gentle traction on the lips of the cervix with ring forceps. A second assistant can provide even better exposure with right-angle vaginal wall retractors or Breisky vaginal retractors. Use of suction devices can also aid viewing.

In general, cervical lacerations of 1 and even 2 cm are not repaired unless they are bleeding. Such tears heal rapidly and ultimately create an irregular, sometimes stellate appearing, external cervical os that indicates previous delivery.

Chronic ectopic pregnancy is a condition in which the pregnancy does not completely resorb during expectant management. The condition arises when there is persistence of the chorionic villi with bleeding into the tubal wall, which is distended slowly and does not rupture. It may arise from chronic bleeding from the fimbriated end of the fallopian tube with subsequent tamponade. In a series of 50 patients with a chronic ectopic pregnancy, pain was present in 86%, vaginal bleeding was present in 68%, and both symptoms were present in 58% (234). Ninety percent of the patients had amenorrhea ranging from 5 to 16 weeks (mean, 9.6 weeks). Most patients develop a pelvic mass that usually is symptomatic. The β-hCG level usually is low but may be absent; ultrasonography may be helpful in the diagnosis; rarely, bowel involvement or ureteral compression or obstruction exists (234,235).

This condition is treated surgically with removal of the affected tube. Often, the ovary must be removed because there is inﬂammation with subsequent adhesion development. A hematoma may be present secondary to chronic bleeding.

Cervical Pregnancy The incidence of cervical pregnancy in the United States ranges from

Pregnancy 1 in 2,400 to 1 in 50,000 pregnancies and accounts for less than 1% of ectopic pregnancies (236,237). The cause of cervical ectopic pregnancies is unknown and the rare occurrence prevents identification of known risk factors. The incidence does appear to be higher with in vitro fertilization procedures, accounting for 3.7% of IVF-related ectopic pregnancies (238).

The clinical criteria for diagnosing a cervical pregnancy include the following findings (239): 1.

Uterus is smaller than the surrounding distended cervix; 2.

3.

4.

Profuse bleeding on manipulation of cervix.

Patients classically present with painless vaginal bleeding, but reports of associated cramping and pain are published (240).

Types of Ectopic Pregnancy

Spontaneous Resolution Some ectopic pregnancies resolve by resorption or by tubal abortion, obviating the need for medical or surgical therapy (221–225). The proportion of ectopic pregnancies that resolve spontaneously and the reason they do so while others do not are unknown. There are no specific criteria for patient selection that predict successful outcome after spontaneous resolution. A falling hCG level is the most common indicator used, but tubal rupture can occur even with falling hCG levels. Patients with low initial levels of β-hCG are generally the best candidates for expectant management, and there is a reported 88% success rate of spontaneous remission with an initial β-hCG level less than 200 mU/mL (226). These patients should be followed with serial β-hCG levels and active management initiated if these levels plateau or rise or the patient develops abdominal pain or signs of tubal rupture (190).

Persistent ectopic pregnancy occurs when a patient underwent conservative surgery (e.g., salpingostomy, fimbrial expression) and viable trophoblastic tissue remains. Histologically, there is no identifiable embryo, the implantation usually is medial to the previous tubal incision, and residual chorionic villi are confined to the tubal muscularis. Peritoneal trophoblastic tissue implants may be responsible for persistence (182,183,227–230).

IBS is a disorder that affects all ages, although most patients have their first symptoms before age 45. Older individuals have a lower reporting frequency. Women are diagnosed with IBS two to three times as often as men and make up 80% of the population with severe IBS. As indicated in Table 352-1, pain or abdominal discomfort is a key symptom for the diagnosis of IBS. These symptoms should be improved with defecation and/or have their onset associated with a change in frequency or form of stool. Painless diarrhea or constipation does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria to be classified as IBS. Supportive symptoms that are not part of the diagnostic criteria include defecation straining, urgency or a feeling of incomplete bowel movement, passing mucus, and bloating.

Abdominal Pain According to the current IBS diagnostic criteria, abdominal pain or discomfort is a prerequisite clinical feature of IBS. Abdominal pain in IBS is highly variable in intensity and location. It is frequently episodic and crampy, but it may be superimposed on a background of constant ache. Pain may be mild enough to be ignored or it may interfere with daily activities. Despite this, malnutrition due to inadequate caloric intake is exceedingly rare with IBS. Sleep deprivation is also unusual because abdominal pain is almost uniformly present only during waking hours. However, patients with severe IBS frequently wake repeatedly during the night; thus, nocturnal pain is a poor discriminating factor between organic and functional bowel disease. Pain is often exacerbated by eating or emotional stress and improved by passage of flatus or stools. In addition, female patients with IBS commonly report worsening symptoms during the premenstrual and menstrual phases.

Based on MRI studies in osteoarthritic knees comparing those with and without pain and on studies mapping tenderness in unanesthetized joints, likely sources of pain include synovial inflammation, joint effusions, and bone marrow edema. Modest synovitis develops in many but not all osteoarthritic joints. Some diseased joints have no synovitis, whereas others have synovial inflammation that approaches the severity of joints with rheumatoid arthritis (Chap. 380). The presence of synovitis on MRI is correlated with the presence and severity of knee pain. Capsular stretching from fluid in the joint stimulates nociceptive fibers there, inducing pain. Increased focal loading as part of the disease not only damages cartilage but probably also injures the underlying bone. As a consequence, bone marrow edema appears on the MRI; histologically, this edema signals the presence of microcracks and scar, which are the consequences of trauma. These lesions may stimulate bone nociceptive fibers. Also, hemostatic pressure within bone rises in OA, and the increased pressure itself may stimulate nociceptive fibers, causing pain.

Painmayarisefromoutside the joint also, including bursaenearthe joints.Commonsourcesofpainnearthekneeareanserinebursitisand iliotibial band syndrome.

Persons with chronic OA pain may develop nervous system alterations as a consequence of disease, changes which decrease inhibitory controls on nociception and its distribution. This may produce allodynia and hyperalgesia in some patients with OA.

Joint pain from OA is activity-related. Pain comes on either during or just after joint use and then gradually resolves. Examples include knee or hip pain with going up or down stairs, pain in weight-bearing joints when walking, and, for hand OA, pain when cooking. Early in disease, pain is episodic, triggered often by a day or two of overactive useofadiseasedjoint,suchasapersonwithkneeOAtakingalongrun and noticing a few days of pain thereafter. As disease progresses, the pain becomes continuous and even begins to be bothersome at night. Stiffness of the affected joint may be prominent, but morning stiffness is usually brief (<30 min).

Insofar as lumbar stenosis can cause a cauda equina syndrome, its differential diagnosis is also considered in Chap. 42 on diseases of the spinal cord.

Degenerative Osteoarthritis of the Spine

Chronic and recurring back pain caused by degenerative arthritic disease is among the most common disorders in general practice. It occurs in later life and may involve all or any part of the spine but is most prevalent in the cervical and lumbar regions. The pain is described as a stiffness that is centered in the affected part of the spine. It is increased initially by movement and is associated with limitation of motion but is often worse on arising in the morning. In contrast to the spinal claudicatory syndrome of lumbar stenosis, warming up and progressive mobilization make the pain better. There is a notable absence of systemic symptoms such as fatigue, malaise, or fever, and, more importantly, there are usually no features of radicular compression although vague aching may be felt in a sciatic distribution. In contrast to conventional lumbar root compression, the straight-leg raising tests do not elicit pain. The sitting position is usually comfortable, although stiffness and discomfort are accentuated when the erect posture is resumed.

The severity of the symptoms often bears little relation to the radiologic changes; pain may be present despite minimal radiographic findings; conversely, marked osteophytic overgrowth with spur formation, ridging, bridging of vertebrae, narrowing of disc spaces, subluxation of posterior joints on flexion, and air in the disc spaces can be seen in both symptomatic and asymptomatic persons.

With reference to the most common of these symptoms, the neck and shoulder pain, in any sizable group of patients older than 50 years of age, approximately 40 percent will be found at times to have some clinical abnormality of the neck, usually crepitus or pain, with restriction of lateral flexion and rotation (less often of extension). Pallis and colleagues, in a survey of 50 patients, all of them older than 50 years of age and none with neurologic complaints, found that 75 percent showed radiologic evidence of narrowing of the cervical spinal canal as a result of osteophytosis of the posterior vertebral bodies or of narrowing of the intervertebral foramina because of osteoarthropathy at the apophyseal joints; thickening of the ligaments (both the ligamentum flavum posteriorly and the posterior longitudinal ligament anteriorly) adds to the narrowing of the canal. However, only half of the patients with radiologic abnormalities showed physical signs of root or cord involvement such as changes in the tendon reflexes in the arms, briskness of reflexes and impairment of vibratory sense in the legs, and sometimes Babinski signs. The occasional finding of a Babinski sign in older individuals who had never had a stroke or complained of neurologic symptoms is often explained by an otherwise inevident cervical osteophyte (Savitsky and Madonick).

The pain is usually centered at the base of the neck or higher, often radiating to an area above the scapula. When brachialgia is also present, it takes several forms: a sharp pain in the preor postaxial border of the limb, extending to the elbow, wrist, or fingers; or a persistent dull ache in the forearm or wrist, sometimes with a burning sensation. Discomfort may be elicited by coughing, Valsalva maneuver, or neck extension, or neck flexion may induce electrical feelings down the spine (Lhermitte symptom). Rarely, the pain is referred substernally.

An urgent surgical procedure was performed.

Burr holes were placed around the region of the hematoma and it was evacuated. The small branch of the middle meningeal artery was ligated and the patient spent a few days in the intensive care unit. Fortunately the patient made an uneventful recovery.

A 35-year-old man was involved in a fight and sustained a punch to the right orbit. He came to the emergency department with double vision.

The double vision was only in one plane.

Examination of the orbits revealed that when the patient was asked to look upward the right eye was unable to move superiorly when adducted. There was some limitation in general eye movement. Assessment of the lateral rectus muscle (abducent nerve [VI]), superior oblique muscle (trochlear nerve [IV]), and the rest of the eye muscles (oculomotor nerve [III]) was otherwise unremarkable.

The patient underwent a CT scan.

A CT scan of the facial bones demonstrated a fracture through the floor of the orbit (Fig. 8.293).

A careful review of this CT scan demonstrated that the inferior oblique muscle had been pulled inferiorly with the fragment of bone in the fracture. This produced a tethering effect, so when the patient was asked to gaze in the upward direction, the left eye was able to do so but the right eye was unable to because of the tethered inferior oblique muscle.

The patient underwent surgical exploration to elevate the small bony fragment and return the inferior oblique to its appropriate position. On follow-up the patient had no complications.

A 25-year-old man complained of significant swelling in front of his right ear before and around mealtimes. This swelling was associated with considerable pain, which was provoked by the ingestion of lemon sweets.

A 65-year-old man is referred to you from his primary care physician (PCP) for evaluation and management of pos-sible osteoporosis. He saw his PCP for evaluation of low back pain. X-rays of the spine showed some degenerative changes in the lumbar spine plus several wedge deformities in the thoracic spine. The patient is a long-time smoker (up to two packs per day) and has two to four glasses of wine with dinner, more on the weekends. He has chronic bronchitis, presumably from smoking, and has been treated on numerous occasions with oral prednisone for exacerba-tions of bronchitis. He is currently on 10 mg/d prednisone. Examination shows kyphosis of the thoracic spine, with some tenderness to fist percussion over the thoracic spine. The dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measure-ment of the lumbar spine is “within the normal limits,” but the radiologist noted that the reading may be misleading because of degenerative changes. The hip measurement shows a T score (number of standard deviations by which the patient’s measured bone density differs from that of a normal young adult) in the femoral neck of –2.2. What further workup should be considered, and what therapy should be initiated?

Images are obtained during a single breath-holding maneuver that allows less motion artifact and collection of continuous data over a larger volume of lung than is possible with conventional CT. Data from the imaging procedure can be reconstructed in coronal or sagittal planes (Fig. 307-3A), as well as the traditional cross-sectional (axial) view.

Further refinements in detector technology have allowed production of scanners with additional detectors along the scanning axis (z-axis). These multidetector CT (MDCT) scanners can obtain multiple slices in a single rotation that are thinner and can be acquired in a shorter period of time. This results in enhanced resolution and

increased image reconstruction ability. As the technology has progressed, higher numbers (currently up to 64) of detectors are used to produce clearer final images. MDCT allows for even shorter breath holds, which are beneficial for all patients but especially children, the elderly, and the critically ill. However, it should be noted that despite the advantages of MDCT, there is an increase in radiation dose compared to single-detector CT to consider.

In MDCT, the additional detectors along the z-axis result in improved use of the contrast bolus. This and the faster scanning times and increased resolution have all led to improved imaging of the pulmonary vasculature and the ability to detect segmental and subsegmental emboli.

The diagnosis is one of exclusion, and care should be taken to ensure that patients do not have intermittent dizziness due to TIA. In patients < 50 years of age, a history of recent trauma or of severe, abrupt-onset, or persistent pain (> 72 hours) should raise concern for vertebral artery dissection with TIAs.

A brain MRI with vascular imaging (e.g., MRA) is sometimes indicated to assess potential intracranial pathology, particularly cerebrovascular disease.

Episodic ataxia type 2 can be corroborated by genetic testing.

Tx: Can usually be prevented through migraine medication, diet, or lifestyle changes. Benzodiazepines or antiemetics may be tried. Surgical therapies are not indicated.

One of the most common causes of loss of consciousness 2° to an abrupt drop in cerebral perfusion. Etiologies include cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac outﬂow obstruction, vasovagal syncope, orthostatic hypotension, micturition-related syncope, basilar TIAs, and idiopathic causes. Presyncope is described as a feeling of imminent loss of consciousness without actual fainting. Commonly confused with seizures.

Suicide attempts are a common and unfortunate consequence of major depression. The lifetime risk of completing suicide in patients previously hospitalized with MDD may be as high as 15%. Overdose is the most common method used in suicide attempts, and antidepressants, especially the TCAs, are frequently involved. Overdose can induce lethal arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. In addition, blood pressure changes and anticholinergic effects including altered mental status and seizures are sometimes seen in TCA overdoses. A 1500 mg dose of imipramine or amitriptyline (less than 7 days’ supply at antidepressant doses) is enough to be lethal in many patients. Toddlers taking 100 mg will likely show evidence of toxicity. Treatment typically involves cardiac monitoring, airway support, and gastric lavage. Sodium bicarbonate is often administered to displace the TCA from cardiac sodium channels.

An overdose with an MAOI can produce a variety of effects including autonomic instability, hyperadrenergic symptoms, psychotic symptoms, confusion, delirium, fever, and seizures. Management of MAOI overdoses usually involves cardiac monitoring, vital signs support, and lavage.

Compared with TCAs and MAOIs, the other antidepressants are generally much safer in overdose. Fatalities with SSRI overdose alone are extremely uncommon. Similarly, SNRIs tend to be much safer in overdose than the TCAs. However, venlafaxine has been associated with some cardiac toxicity in overdose and appears to be less safe than SSRIs. Bupropion is associated with seizures in overdose, and mirtazapine may be associated with sedation, disorientation, and tachycardia. With the newer agents, fatal overdoses often involve the combination of the antidepressant with other drugs, including alcohol. Management of overdose with the newer antidepressants usually involves emptying of gastric contents and vital sign support as the initial intervention.

Antidepressants are commonly prescribed with other psychotropic and nonpsychotropic agents. There is potential for drug interactions with all antidepressants, but the most serious of these involve the MAOIs and, to a lesser extent, the TCAs.

Treatment of Overdose

This consists of the support of ventilation and administration of naloxone (Narcan), or the longer-acting nalmefene, both specific antidotes to the opiates and also to the synthetic analgesics. The dose of naloxone in adults is usually 0.4 to 0.5 mg and repeated in larger increments (the second dose is typically 2 mg) every 2 min to a dose of 15 mg intravenously as outlined by Boyer. For children, a higher initial dose of 0.1 mg/kg is recommended. Intranansal preparations of 2 mg and 4 mg are available for emergency treatment but are less consistently effectively than the intravenous preparation. The improvements in circulation and respiration and reversal of miosis are usually dramatic. Failure of naloxone to produce such a response should cast doubt on the diagnosis of opioid intoxication. A narcotic withdrawal response may be seen and can be dramatic and resistant to treatment. If an adequate respiratory and pupillary response to naloxone is obtained, the patient should nonetheless be observed for up to 24 h and further doses of naloxone (50 percent higher than the ones previously found effective) can be given intramuscularly as often as necessary.

Naloxone has less direct effect on consciousness, however, and the patient may remain drowsy for many hours. This is not harmful provided respiration is well maintained. Although nalmefene has a plasma half-life of 11 h, compared to 60 to 90 min for naloxone, it has no clear advantage in emergency practice. Gastric lavage is a useful measure if the drug was taken orally. This procedure may be efficacious many hours after ingestion, as one of the toxic effects of opioids is ileus, which causes some of the drug to be retained in the stomach. Concerns of precipitating opioid withdrawal by giving naloxone are generally unfounded.

As a rule, narcolepsy has a gradual onset between the ages of 15 and 35 years; in fully 90 percent of narcoleptics, the condition is established by age 25. Narcolepsy is usually the first symptom, less often cataplexy, and rarely sleep paralysis. The essential disorder is one of frequent attacks of irresistible sleepiness. Several times a day, usually after meals or while sitting in class or in other boring or sedentary situations, the affected person is assailed by an uncontrollable desire to sleep. The eyes close, the muscles relax, breathing deepens slightly, and by all

The periods of sleep rarely last longer than 15 min unless the patient is reclining, when he may continue to sleep for an hour or longer. At the conclusion of a nap, the patient feels somewhat refreshed. It should be emphasized that there are many narcoleptics who tend to be pervasively drowsy throughout the day.

Signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary depending on the infecting organism and the patient’s immune status. In typical pneumonias, the usual presentation is a patient with high fever, rigors, productive cough, chills, and pleuritic chest pain. Chest radiography often will show infiltrates (11). The following agents, listed in decreasing order, cause two-thirds of all bacterial pneumonias: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus inﬂuenza, Klebsiella pneumoniae, gram-negative organisms, and anaerobic bacteria. Atypical pneumonias are more insidious in onset than typical pneumonias. Patients have moderate fever without the characteristic rigors and chills. Additional symptoms include a nonproductive cough, headache, myalgias, and mild leukocytosis. Chest radiography reveals bronchopneumonia with a diffuse interstitial pattern; characteristically, the patient does not appear to be as ill as the x-ray suggests. Common causes of atypical pneumonia include viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia pneumoniae (also called the TWAR agent), and other rare agents.

A strong index of suspicion is required for diagnosis, especially in elderly and immunocompromised individuals, who have altered response mechanisms. This is true with “typical agents.” Subtle clues in the elderly include changes in mentation, confusion, and exacerbation of other illnesses. The febrile response may be entirely absent, and the results of the physical examination are not predictive of pneumonia. In high-risk groups, an increased respiratory rate of greater than 25 breaths per minute remains the most reliable sign of infection. Mortality in these high-risk groups of patients is strongly correlated with the ability of the host to mount normal defenses to the symptoms of fever, chills, and tachycardia.

All women suspected of having pneumonia should undergo chest radiography to establish the diagnosis and to detect alternate diagnoses such as congestive heart failure and tumors.

P. aeruginosa, or (rarely) S. pneumoniae. Aspiration pneumonia is typically a polymicrobial infection involving both aerobes and anaerobes. A significant pleural effusion should be tapped for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. If the fluid has a pH of <7, a glucose level of <2. 2 mmol/L, and a lactate dehydrogenase concentration of >1000 U/L or if bacteria are seen or cultured, then it should be completely drained; a chest tube is often required and video-assisted thoracoscopy may be needed for late treatment or difficult cases.

Follow-Up Fever and leukocytosis usually resolve within 2–4 days in otherwise healthy patients with CAP, but physical findings may persist longer. Chest radiographic abnormalities are slowest to resolve (4–12 weeks), with the speed of clearance depending on the patient’s age and underlying lung disease. Patients may be discharged from the hospital once their clinical conditions, including comorbidities, are stable. The site of residence after discharge (nursing home, home with family, home alone) is an important discharge timing consideration, particularly for elderly patients. For a hospitalized patient, a follow-up radiograph ∼4–6 weeks later is recommended. If relapse or recurrence is documented, particularly in the same lung segment, the possibility of an underlying neoplasm must be considered.

The prognosis of CAP depends on the patient’s age, comorbidities, and site of treatment (inpatient or outpatient). Young patients without comorbidity do well and usually recover fully after ~2 weeks. Older patients and those with comorbid conditions can take several weeks longer to recover fully. The overall mortality rate for the outpatient group is <1%. For patients requiring hospitalization, the overall mortality rate is estimated at 10%, with ~50% of deaths directly attributable to pneumonia.

The main preventive measure is vaccination (Chap. 148). Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices should be followed for influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.

Pneumonia Pneumonia is defined as inﬂammation of the distal lung that includes terminal airways, alveolar spaces, and the interstitium. Pneumonia may have multiple causes, including viral and bacterial infections or aspiration. Aspiration pneumonia is usually the result of depressed awareness commonly associated with the use of drugs and alcohol or anesthesia. Viral pneumonias are caused by multiple infectious agents, including inﬂuenza A or B, parainﬂuenza virus, or respiratory syncytial virus. Most viral syndromes are spread by aerosolization associated with coughing, sneezing, and even conversation. Incubation is short, requiring only 1 to 3 days before the acute onset of fever, chills, headache, fatigue, and myalgias. Symptom intensity is directly related to intensity of the host febrile reaction. Pneumonia develops in only 1% of patients who have a viral syndrome, but mortality rates may reach 30% in immunocompromised individuals and the elderly. An additional risk is the development of secondary bacterial pneumonias after the initial viral insult. These infections are more common in elderly patients and may explain the high fatality in this group (8). Staphylococcal pneumonias, which often arise from a previous viral infection, are extremely lethal regardless of patient age. The best treatment for viral pneumonia is prevention by immunization. Treatment is supportive and consists mostly of administration of antipyretics and ﬂuids.

Bacterial pneumonia is classified as either community acquired or nosocomial, and in many cases the classification determines prognosis and antibiotic therapy. Risk factors that contribute to mortality are chronic cardiopulmonary diseases, alcoholism, diabetes, renal failure, malignancy, and malnutrition. Prognostic features associated with poor outcome include greater than two lobe involvement, respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths per minute on presentation, severe hypoxemia (<60 mm Hg on room air), hypoalbuminemia, and septicemia. Pneumonia is a common cause of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a mortality rate between 50% and 70% (9,10).

In many other ways they are similar, except for their severity. Many cases terminate fatally in 2 to 4 days, but in others, survival is longer.

Trigeminal neuralgia (See also “Trigeminal Neuralgia” in Chap. 9) The frequent and important disease of the fifth nerve is trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux). This condition has been known since ancient times, having been described by Arateus in the first century A.D., by John Locke in 1677, by Nicolaus Andre in 1756, and by John Fothergill in 1776 (according to Katusic et al). The overall incidence rate for both sexes combined is 4.3 per 100,000 persons per year, but it is higher for women than for men (in a ratio of 3:2) and is much higher in the elderly. The mean age of onset is 52 to 58 years for the idiopathic form and 30 to 35 years for the symptomatic forms, the latter being caused by trauma or vascular, neoplastic, and demyelinative diseases. In the last decade it has become apparent, mainly from the work of Jannetta, that a proportion of cases result from compression and secondary demyelination of trigeminal nerve rootlets by small branches of the basilar artery (see Love and Coakham).

The characteristic features of trigeminal neuralgia are its paroxysmal facial pain, its unilaterality, the tendency to involve the second and third divisions of the trigeminal nerve, an intensity that makes the patient grimace or wince (tic), the presence of a trigger point on the face, the lack of demonstrable sensory or motor deficit, and its response in more than half of the cases to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia and its differentiation from other forms of intermittent facial pain described below—as well as from cluster headache, dental neuralgia, temporomandibular joint pain, and atypical facial pain—is usually not difficult, especially if there is a trigger point and no demonstrable evidence of sensory or motor impairment. Furthermore, the vascular compressive form is difficult to diagnose without high-resolution neuroimaging or exposure at operation and most such cases are therefore characterized as idiopathic until revealed as vascular in causation.

Pneumonia Pneumonia is the most common serious pneumococcal syndrome and is considered invasive when associated with a positive blood culture. Pneumococcal pneumonia can present as a mild community-acquired infection at one extreme and as a life-threatening disease requiring intubation and intensive support at the other.

presenting manifestations The presentation of pneumococcal pneumonia does not reliably distinguish it from pneumonia of other etiologies. In a subset of cases, pneumococcal pneumonia is recognized at the outset as associated with a viral upper respiratory infection and is characterized by the abrupt onset of cough and dyspnea accompanied by fever, shaking chills, and myalgias. The cough evolves from nonpurulent to productive of sputum that is purulent and sometimes tinged with blood. Patients may describe stabbing pleuritic chest pain and significant dyspnea indicating involvement of the parietal pleura. Among the elderly, the presenting clinical symptoms may be less specific, with confusion or malaise but without fever or cough. In such cases, a high index of suspicion is required because failure to treat pneumococcal pneumonia promptly in an elderly patient is likely to result in rapid evolution of the infection, with increased severity, morbidity, and risk of death.

findings on pHysical examination The clinical signs associated with pneumococcal pneumonia among adults include tachypnea (>30 breaths/min) and tachycardia, hypotension in severe cases, and fever in most cases (although not in all elderly patients). Respiratory signs are varied, including dullness to percussion in areas of the chest with significant consolidation, crackles on auscultation, reduced expansion of the chest in some cases as a result of splinting to reduce pain, bronchial breathing in a minority of cases, pleural rub in occasional cases, and cyanosis in cases with significant hypoxemia. Among infants with severe pneumonia, chest wall indrawing and nasal flaring are common. Nonrespiratory findings can include upper abdominal pain if the diaphragmatic pleura is involved as well as mental status changes, particularly confusion in elderly patients.

Painless thyroiditis, or “silent” thyroiditis, occurs in patients with underlying autoimmune thyroid disease and has a clinical course similar to that of subacute thyroiditis. The condition occurs in up to 5% of women 3–6 months after pregnancy and is then termed postpartum thyroiditis. Typically, patients have a brief phase of thyrotoxicosis lasting 2–4 weeks, followed by hypothyroidism for 4–12 weeks, and then resolution; often, however, only one phase is apparent. The condition is associated with the presence of TPO antibodies antepartum, and it is three times more common in women with type 1 diabetes mellitus. As in subacute thyroiditis, the uptake of 99mTc pertechnetate or radioactive iodine is initially suppressed. In addition to the painless goiter, silent thyroiditis can be distinguished from subacute thyroiditis by a normal ESR and the presence of TPO antibodies. Glucocorticoid treatment is not indicated for silent thyroiditis. Severe thyrotoxic symptoms can be managed with a brief course of propranolol, 20–40 mg three or four times daily. Thyroxine replacement may be needed for the hypothyroid phase but should be withdrawn after 6–9 months, as recovery is the rule. Annual follow-up thereafter is recommended, because a proportion of these individuals develop permanent hypothyroidism. The condition may recur in subsequent pregnancies.

Patients receiving cytokines such as IFN-α or IL-2 may develop painless thyroiditis. IFN-α, which is used to treat chronic hepatitis B or C and hematologic and skin malignancies, causes thyroid dysfunction in up to 5% of treated patients. It has been associated with painless thyroiditis, hypothyroidism, and Graves’ disease, and is most common in women with TPO antibodies prior to treatment. For discussion of amiodarone, see “Amiodarone Effects on Thyroid Function,” below.

Hyperfunctioning nodules present with hyperthyroidism and local symptoms (dysphagia, dyspnea, cough, choking sensation) and are associated with a  family history (especially medullary thyroid cancer).

An ↑ risk of malignancy is associated with a history of neck irradiation, “cold” nodules on radionuclide scan, male sex, age < 20 or > 70, firm and fixed solitary nodules, a  family history (especially medullary thyroid cancer), and rapidly growing nodules with hoarseness.

Innervation of the Kidneys

Renal nerves regulate RBF, GFR, and salt and water reabsorption by the nephron. The nerve supply to the kidneys consists of sympathetic nerve fibers that originate in the celiac plexus. There is no corresponding parasympathetic innervation. Adrenergic fibers innervating the kidneys release norepinephrine and lie adjacent to the smooth muscle cells of the major branches of the renal artery (interlobar, arcuate, and interlobular arteries) as well as the afferent and efferent arterioles. In addition, sympathetic nerves innervate the renin-producing granular cells of the afferent arterioles. Renin secretion is stimulated by increased sympathetic activity. Nerve fibers also innervate the proximal tubule, loop of Henle, distal tubule, and collecting duct; activation of these nerves enhances Na+ reabsorption by these nephron segments.

Assessment of Renal Function

The coordinated actions of the nephron’s various segments determine the final amount of a substance that appears in urine. This represents three general processes (1) glomerular

CHAPTER 33 Elements of Renal Function

This relationship permits quantification of the amount of substance x excreted in urine versus the amount returned to the systemic circulation in renal venous blood. Thus for any substance that is neither synthesized nor metabolized, the amount that enters the kidneys is equal to the amount that leaves the kidneys in urine plus the amount that leaves the kidneys in renal venous blood.

The principle of renal clearance emphasizes the excretory function of the kidneys; it considers only the rate at which a substance is excreted into urine and not its rate of return to the systemic circulation in the renal vein. Therefore in terms of mass balance (

Eq. 33.1 ) the urinary excretion rate of substance x (Ux × V̇ ) is proportional to the plasma concentration of substance x (

Renal Loss of Potassium Drugs can increase renal K+ excretion by a variety of different mechanisms. Diuretics are a particularly common cause, due to associated increases in distal tubular Na+ delivery and 306 distal tubular flow rate, in addition to secondary hyperaldosteronism. Thiazides have a greater effect on plasma K+ concentration than loop diuretics, despite their lesser natriuretic effect. The diuretic effect of thiazides is largely due to inhibition of the Na+-Cl– cotransporter NCC in DCT cells. This leads to a direct increase in the delivery of luminal Na+ to the principal cells immediately

document (2) 

Knowledge of the factors controlling potassium secretion by the cortical collecting tubule principal cell can be helpful in understanding the basis for treatment of the hyperkalemia, especially if discontinuing the offending agent is not a reasonable clinical option. Potassium secretion is encouraged by a higher urine flow rate, increased distal delivery of sodium, distal delivery of a poorly reabsorbed anion (such as bicarbonate), and/or administration of a loop diuretic. Therefore, the approach to treatment in this patient should include intravenous 0.9% NaCl to expand the ECF and deliver more Na+ and Cl− to the

CHAPTER 36 Potassium, Calcium, and Phosphate Homeostasis

Although an acute (e.g., within hours) increase in aldosterone levels enhances the activity of Na+,K+-ATPase, K+ excretion does not increase immediately. The reason for this relates to the effect of aldosterone on Na+ reabsorption and tubular flow. Aldosterone stimulates reabsorption of Na+ and water and thus decreases tubular flow. Reduction in flow in turn decreases K+ secretion (as discussed in more detail later). However, chronic stimulation of Na+ reabsorption increases the ECFV and thereby returns tubular flow to normal. These actions allow a direct stimulatory effect of aldosterone on the ASDN to enhance K+ excretion.

Although AVP does not affect urinary K+ excretion, this hormone does promote secretion of K+ by the ASDN (Fig.

36.8 ). AVP increases the electrochemical driving force for exit of K+ across the apical membrane of principal cells by stimulating uptake of Na+ across the apical membrane of these cells. The increased Na+ uptake reduces the electrical potential difference across the apical membrane (i.e., the interior of the cell becomes less negatively charged). Despite this effect, AVP does not change K+ secretion by these nephron segments. The reason for this relates to the effect of AVP on tubular fluid flow. AVP decreases flow of tubular fluid by stimulating water reabsorption. The decrease in tubular flow in turn reduces secretion of K+ (explained later). The inhibitory effect of decreased flow of tubular fluid offsets the stimulatory effect of AVP on the electrochemical driving force for exit of K+ across the apical membrane (see

document (4) 

and Cl− to the cortical collecting tubule. In addition, because the trimethoprim molecule must be protonated to inhibit ENaC, alkalinization of the renal tubule fluid enhances distal tubular K+ secretion. As an alternative to inducing bicarbonaturia to assist in potassium secretion, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor may be administered to induce a kaliuresis. However, in the case presented here, for acetazolamide to be effective, the non-AG metabolic acidosis in this patient would first need to be corrected; Acetazolamide would, thus, require the coadministration of intravenous sodium bicarbonate for maximal benefit. Finally, systemic

maximal benefit. Finally, systemic hyperkalemia directly suppresses renal ammoniagenesis, ammonium excretion, and, thus, acid excretion. Correcting the hyperkalemia with a potassium-binding resin (Kayexalate) is sometimes appropriate in these patients; the subsequent decline in the plasma K+ concentration will also increase urinary ammonium excretion, helping correct the acidosis.

Migrainous neuralgia may be localized to the mouth. Episodes of pain and remission without an identifiable cause and a lack of relief with local anesthesia are important clues. Trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux) can involve the entire branch or part of the mandibular or maxillary branch of the fifth cranial nerve and can produce pain in one or a few teeth. Pain may occur spontaneously or may be triggered by touching the lip or gingiva, brushing the teeth, or chewing. Glossopharyngeal neuralgia produces similar acute neuropathic symptoms in the distribution of the ninth cranial nerve. Swallowing, sneezing, coughing, or pressure on the tragus of the ear triggers pain that is felt in the base of the tongue, pharynx, and soft palate and may be referred to the temporomandibular joint. Neuritis involving the maxillary and mandibular divisions of the trigeminal nerve (e.g., maxillary sinusitis, neuroma, and leukemic infiltrate) is distinguished from ordinary toothache by the neuropathic quality of the pain. Occasionally, phantom pain follows tooth extraction. Pain and hyperalgesia behind the ear and on the side of the face in the day or so before facial weakness develops often constitute the earliest symptom of Bell’s palsy. Likewise, similar symptoms may precede visible lesions of herpes zoster infecting the seventh nerve (Ramsey-Hunt syndrome) or trigeminal nerve. Postherpetic neuralgia may follow either condition. Coronary ischemia may produce pain exclusively in the face and jaw; as in typical angina pectoris, this pain is usually reproducible with increased myocardial demand.

Herpes gingivostomatitis involves the gingivae and the vermilion border of the lips. Herpes labialis (cold sores or fever blisters) is limited to the vermilion border involving skin and mucous membranes. Clinical manifestations of primary HSV gingivostomatitis include typical oropharyngeal vesicular lesions with high fever, malaise, stinging mouth pain, drooling, fetid breath, and cervical lymphadenopathy.

Herpetic skin lesions are quite painful and characteristically begin as erythematous papules that quickly progress tothe characteristically grouped, 2-to 4-mm, fluid-filled vesicles on an erythematous base. Removal of the vesicle roofreveals a small, sharply demarcated ulcer with a punched-outappearance. The characteristic grouped vesicles distinguishHSV from chickenpox (see Chapter 97). Within several days,the vesicles become pustular, rupture, and encrust. Diagnosisis made clinically, or with viral culture, fluorescent antibody staining, or polymerase chain reaction. Scarring is uncommon, but there may be residual hyperpigmentation. After primary infection, the virus remains latent in nerve dorsal rootganglia. About 20% to 40% of adults experience recurrentoral episodes of HSV labialis throughout life. Recurrencesoccur in roughly the same location and may be preceded byprodromal symptoms of tingling or burning without fever orlymphadenopathy.

Emergency consent requires the surgeon to consider if and how possible interven-tions might save a patient’s life, and if successful, what kind of disability might be anticipated. Surgical emergencies are one of the few instances where the limits of patient autonomy are freely acknowledged, and surgeons are empowered by law and ethics to act promptly in the best interests of their patients according to the surgeon’s judgment.

Routine Laboratory Testing Patients with new-onset HF and those with chronic HF and acute decompensation should have a complete blood count, a panel of electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, hepatic enzymes, and a urinalysis. Selected patients should have assessment for diabetes mellitus (fasting serum glucose or oral glucose tolerance test), dyslipidemia (fasting lipid panel), and thyroid abnormalities (thyroid-stimulating hormone level).

Electrocardiogram (ECG) A routine 12-lead ECG is recommended. The major importance of the ECG is to assess cardiac rhythm and determine the presence of LV hypertrophy or a prior MI (presence or absence of Q waves) as well as to determine QRS width to ascertain whether the patient may benefit from resynchronization therapy (see below). A normal ECG virtually excludes LV systolic dysfunction.

Chest X-Ray A chest x-ray provides useful information about cardiac size and shape, as well as the state of the pulmonary vasculature, and may identify noncardiac causes of the patient’s symptoms. Although patients with acute HF have evidence of pulmonary hypertension, interstitial edema, and/or pulmonary edema, the majority of patients with chronic HF do not. The absence of these findings in patients with chronic HF reflects the increased capacity of the lymphatics to remove interstitial and/or pulmonary fluid.

MEDICAL TREATMENT (FIG. 284-4)

The management of chronic severe MR depends to some degree on its cause. Warfarin should be provided once AF intervenes with a target INR of 2–3. Novel oral anticoagulants are not approved for this indication. Cardioversion should be considered depending on the clinical context and LA size. In contrast to the acute setting, there are no large, long-term prospective studies to substantiate the use of vasodilators for the treatment of chronic, isolated severe MR with preserved LV systolic function in the absence of systemic hypertension. The severity of MR in the setting of an ischemic or nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy may diminish with aggressive guideline-directed treatment of heart failure including the use of diuretics, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, digitalis, and biventricular pacing (cardiac resynchronization therapy [CRT]) when otherwise indicated. Asymptomatic patients with severe MR in sinus rhythm with normal LV size and systolic function should avoid isometric forms of exercise.

Patients with acute severe MR require urgent stabilization and preparation for surgery. Diuretics, intravenous vasodilators (particularly sodium nitroprusside), and even intraaortic balloon counterpulsation may be needed for patients with post-MI papillary muscle rupture or other forms of acute severe MR.

document (2) 

Postoperative CHF frequently results from excessive administration of intravenous ﬂuids and blood products. Other common postoperative causes are myocardial infarction, systemic infection, pulmonary embolism, and cardiac arrhythmias. The cause of postoperative heart failure must be diagnosed because, to be successful, treatment should be directed simultaneously to the underlying cause. Postoperative diagnosis of CHF is more difficult than preoperative diagnosis because the signs and symptoms of CHF are not specific and may result from other causes. The most reliable method of detecting CHF is chest radiography, in which the presence of cardiomegaly or evidence of pulmonary edema is a helpful diagnostic feature.

Acute postoperative CHF frequently manifests as pulmonary edema. Treatment of pulmonary edema may include the use of intravenous furosemide, supplemental oxygen, morphine sulfate, and elevation of the head of the bed. Intravenous aminophylline may be useful if cardiogenic asthma is present. Electrocardiography, in addition to laboratory evaluation, including arterial blood gas, serum electrolyte, and renal function chemistry measurements, should be obtained expediently. If the patient’s condition does not improve rapidly, she should be transferred to an intensive care unit.

Arrhythmias Nearly all arrhythmias found in otherwise healthy patients are asymptomatic and of limited consequence. In patients with underlying cardiac disease, however, even brief episodes of arrhythmias may result in significant cardiac morbidity and mortality.

The basic principles of therapy are not different in the geriatric age group from those described in Chapter 11, but the usual cautions regarding altered pharmacokinetics and blunted compensatory mechanisms apply. Because of its safety, nondrug therapy (weight reduction in the obese and moderate salt restriction) should be encouraged. Thiazides are a reasonable first step in drug therapy. The hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, and hyperuricemia caused by these agents are more relevant in the elderly because of the higher prevalence in these patients of arrhythmias, type 2 diabetes, and gout.

Thus, use of low antihypertensive doses— rather than maximum diuretic doses—is important. Calcium channel blockers are effective and safe if titrated to the appropriate response. They are especially useful in patients who also have atherosclerotic angina (see Chapter 12). Beta blockers are potentially hazardous in patients with obstructive airway disease and are considered less useful than calcium channel blockers in older patients unless chronic heart failure is present. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are also considered less useful in the elderly unless heart failure or diabetes is present. The most powerful drugs, such as minoxidil, are

On cortical sensory testing (e.g., two-point discrimination, graphesthesia), abnormalities are often found but primary sensation is usually intact. Anterior parietal infarction may present as a pseudothalamic syndrome with contralateral loss of primary sensation from head to toe. Dysesthesias or a sense of numbness and, rarely, a painful state may also occur.

Focal Sensory Seizures These seizures generally are due to lesions in the area of the postcentral or precentral gyrus. The principal symptom of focal sensory seizures is tingling, but additional, more complex sensations may occur, such as a rushing feeling, a sense of warmth, or a sense of movement without detectable motion. Symptoms typically are unilateral; commonly begin in the arm or hand, face, or foot; and often spread in a manner that reflects the cortical representation of different bodily parts, as in a Jacksonian march. Their duration is variable; seizures may be transient, lasting only for seconds, or persist for an hour or more. Focal motor features may supervene, often becoming generalized with loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic jerking.

PREVALENCE, MORBIDITY, AND MORTALITY

Gait and balance problems are common in the elderly and contribute to the risk of falls and injury. Gait disorders have been described in 15% of individuals older than 65. By age 80 one person in four will use a mechanical aid to assist with ambulation. Among those 85 and older, the prevalence of gait abnormality approaches 40%. In epidemiologic studies, gait disorders are consistently identified as a major risk factor for falls and injury.

In most patients, the condition improves spontaneously 1–3 years after onset. While pain usually improves, many patients are left with some limitation of shoulder motion. Early mobilization of the arm following an injury to the shoulder may prevent the development of this disease. Physical therapy provides the foundation of treatment for adhesive capsulitis. Local injections of glucocorticoids and NSAIDs may also provide relief of symptoms. Slow but forceful injection of contrast material into the joint may lyse adhesions and stretch the capsule, resulting in improvement of shoulder motion. Manipulation under anesthesia may be helpful in some patients.

Lateral epicondylitis, or tennis elbow, is a painful condition involving the soft tissue over the lateral aspect of the elbow. The pain originates ator near the siteof attachment of the commonextensorsto the lateral epicondyle and may radiate into the forearm and dorsum of the wrist. The pain usually appears after work or recreational activities involving repeated motions of wrist extension and supination against resistance. Most patients with this disorder injure themselves in activities other than tennis, such as pulling weeds, carrying suitcases or briefcases, or using a screwdriver. The injury in tennis usually occurs when hitting a backhand with the elbow flexed. Shaking hands and opening doors can reproduce the pain. Striking the lateral elbow against a solid object may also induce pain.
