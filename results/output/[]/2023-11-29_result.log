2023-11-29 14:02:08,559 query: A junior orthopaedic surgery resident is completing a carpal tunnel repair with the department chairman as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take? 

2023-11-29 14:02:08,559 options:  <A> Disclose the error to the patient and put it in the operative report. <B> Tell the attending that he cannot fail to disclose this mistake. <C> Report the physician to the ethics committee. <D> Refuse to dictate the operative report.

Types of medical May involve patient identification, diagnosis, monitoring, nosocomial infection, medications, errors procedures, devices, documentation, handoffs. Medical errors should be disclosed to patients, independent of immediate outcome (harmful or not).

“Symptoms, then, are in reality nothing but the cry from suffering organs.” “Man is an intelligence in servitude to his organs.” “When every part of the machine is correctly adjusted and in perfect harmony, health will hold dominion over the human organism by laws as natural and immutable as the laws of gravity.” —Andrew T.

In this section, we have divided the High-Yield Facts into the major Organ Systems. Within each Organ System are several subsections, including Embryology, Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, and Pharmacology. As you progress through each Organ System, refer back to information in the previous subsections to organize these basic science subsections into a “vertically integrated” framework for learning. Below is some general advice for studying the organ systems by these subsections.

Relevant embryology is included in each organ system subsection. Embryology tends to correspond well with the relevant anatomy, especially with regard to congenital malformations.

Several topics fall under this heading, including gross anatomy, histology, and neuroanatomy. Do not memorize all the small details; however, do not ignore anatomy altogether. Review what you have already learned and what you wish you had learned. Many questions require two or more steps. The first step is to identify a structure on anatomic cross section, electron micrograph, or photomicrograph. The second step may require an understanding of the clinical significance of the structure.

Alternative means to warn or protect those at risk is not possible

Self-harm is likely

Steps can be taken to prevent harm

Examples of exceptions to patient confidentiality (many are state specific) include the following (“The physician’s good judgment SAVED the day”):

Suicidal/homicidal patients.

Abuse (children, elderly, and/or prisoners).

Duty to protect—state-specific laws that sometimes allow physician to inform or somehow protect potential Victim from harm.

Epileptic patients and other impaired automobile drivers.

Reportable Diseases (eg, STIs, hepatitis, food poisoning); physicians may have a duty to warn public officials, who will then notify people at risk. Dangerous communicable diseases, such as TB or Ebola, may require involuntary treatment.

Patient is not adherent. Attempt to identify the reason for nonadherence and determine his/her willingness to change; do not coerce the patient into adhering and do not refer him/her to another physician.

A patient’s family member asks you not to disclose the results of a test if the prognosis is poor because the patient will be “unable to handle it.”

Attempt to identify why the family member believes such information would be detrimental to the patient’s condition. Explain that as long as the patient has decision-making capacity and does not indicate otherwise, communication of information concerning his/her care will not be withheld. However, if you believe the patient might seriously harm himself/herself or others if informed, then you may invoke therapeutic privilege and withhold the information.

Patient is suicidal. Assess the seriousness of the threat. If it is serious, suggest that the patient remain in the hospital voluntarily; patient can be hospitalized involuntarily if he/she refuses.

Discounted fee-for-Patient pays for each individual service at a discounted rate predetermined by providers and payers service (eg, PPOs).

Medicare and Medicaid—federal social healthcare programs that originated from amendments to the Social Security Act.

Medicare is available to patients ≥ 65 years old, < 65 with certain disabilities, and those with end-stage renal disease.

Embryology, and Neuroscience 715

This section is a database of top-rated basic science review books, sample examination books, software, websites, and apps that have been marketed to medical students studying for the USMLE Step 1. For each recommended resource, we list (where applicable) the Title, the First Author (or editor), the Current Publisher, the Copyright Year, the Number of Pages, the Approximate List Price, the Format of the resource, and the Number of Test Questions. Finally, each recommended resource receives a Rating. Within each section, resources are arranged first by Rating and then alphabetically by the first author within each Rating group.

For a complete list of resources, including summaries that describe their overall style and utility, go to www.firstaidteam.com/bonus

A letter rating scale with six different grades reflects the detailed student evaluations for Rated Resources. Each rated resource receives a rating as follows:

The Rating is meant to reflect the overall usefulness of the resource in helping medical students prepare for the USMLE Step 1. This is based on a number of factors, including:

The cost

The readability of the text or usability of the app

The appropriateness and accuracy of the material

The quality and number of sample questions

The quality of written answers to sample questions

The quality and appropriateness of the illustrations (eg, graphs, diagrams, photographs)

The length of the text (longer is not necessarily better)

The quality and number of other resources available in the same discipline

The importance of the discipline for the USMLE Step 1

Please note that ratings do not reflect the quality of the resources for purposes other than reviewing for the USMLE Step 1. Many books with lower ratings are well written and informative but are not ideal for boards preparation. We have not listed or commented on general textbooks available in the basic sciences.

Evaluations are based on the cumulative results of formal and informal surveys of thousands of medical students at many medical schools across the country. The ratings represent a consensus opinion, but there may have been a broad range of opinion or limited student feedback on any particular resource.

Please note that the data listed are subject to change in that:

Basal cell carcinoma Most common skin cancer. Found in sun-exposed areas of body (eg, face). Locally invasive, but rarely metastasizes. Waxy, pink, pearly nodules, commonly with telangiectasias, rolled borders A , central crusting or ulceration. BCCs also appear as nonhealing ulcers with infiltrating growth B or as a scaling plaque (superficial BCC) C . Basal cell tumors have “palisading” (aligned) nuclei D .

Keratoacanthoma Seen in middle-aged and elderly individuals. Rapidly growing, resembles squamous cell carcinoma. Presents as dome-shaped nodule with keratin-filled center. Grows rapidly (4-6 weeks) and may spontaneously regress

E .

Melanoma Common tumor with significant risk of metastasis. S-100 tumor marker. Associated with dysplastic nevi; fair-skinned persons are at  risk. Depth of tumor (Breslow thickness) correlates with risk of metastasis. Look for the ABCDEs: Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation, Diameter > 6 mm, and Evolution over time. At least 4 different types of melanoma, including superficial spreading F , nodular G , lentigo maligna H , and acral lentiginous (highest prevalence in African-Americans and Asians) I . Often driven by activating mutation in BRAF kinase. Primary treatment is excision with appropriately wide margins. Metastatic or unresectable melanoma in patients with BRAF V600E mutation may benefit from vemurafenib, a BRAF kinase inhibitor.

Tumor grade vs stage Differentiation—degree to which a tumor resembles its tissue of origin. Well-differentiated tumors (often less aggressive) closely resemble their tissue of origin, whereas poorly differentiated tumors (often more aggressive) do not.

Anaplasia—complete lack of differentiation of cells in a malignant neoplasm.

Grade Degree of cellular differentiation and mitotic activity on histology. Ranges from low grade (well-differentiated) to high grade (poorly differentiated, undifferentiated, or anaplastic). Low grade High grade

Stage Degree of localization/spread based on site and size of 1° lesion, spread to regional lymph nodes, presence of metastases. Based on clinical (c) or pathologic (p) findings. Stage T generally has more prognostic value than

Lymphgrade (eg, a high-stage yet low-grade tumor is node N tumor). Stage determines Survival. Blood or lymphatic vessel

TNM staging system (Stage = Spread):

Spread to otherT = Tumor size/invasiveness, N = Node organs and tissues involvement, M = Metastases, eg, cT3N1M0. Each TNM factor has independent prognostic value; N and M are often most important.

Cancer epidemiology Skin cancer (basal > squamous >> melanoma) is the most common cancer (not included below).

Hydronephrosis Distention/dilation of renal pelvis and calyces A . Usually caused by urinary tract obstruction (eg, renal stones, severe BPH, congenital obstructions, cervical cancer, injury to ureter); other causes include retroperitoneal fibrosis, vesicoureteral reflux. Dilation occurs proximal to site of pathology. Serum creatinine becomes elevated if obstruction is bilateral or if patient has an obstructed solitary kidney. Leads to compression and possible atrophy of renal cortex and medulla.

Urinary incontinence Mixed incontinence has features of both stress and urgency incontinence.

Acute cystitis Inflammation of urinary bladder. Presents as suprapubic pain, dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency. Systemic signs (eg, high fever, chills) are usually absent. Risk factors include female sex (short urethra), sexual intercourse, indwelling catheter, diabetes mellitus, impaired bladder emptying. Causes:

Staphylococcus saprophyticus—seen in sexually active young women (E coli is still more common in this group)

Proteus mirabilis—urine has ammonia scent Labs: ⊕ leukocyte esterase. ⊕ nitrites (indicate gram ⊝ organisms). Sterile pyuria (pyuria with ⊝ urine cultures) could suggest urethritis by Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis. Treatment: antibiotics (eg, TMP-SMX, nitrofurantoin).

Abdominal aortic Usually associated with atherosclerosis. Risk factors include history of tobacco use,  age, male aneurysm sex, family history. May present as palpable pulsatile abdominal mass (arrows in A point to outer dilated calcified aortic wall, with partial crescent-shaped non-opacification of aorta due to flap/ clot). Most often infrarenal (distal to origin of renal arteries).

Traumatic aortic Due to trauma and/or deceleration injury, most commonly at aortic isthmus (proximal descending rupture aorta just distal to origin of left subclavian artery). X-ray may reveal widened mediastinum.

Longitudinal intimal tear forming a false lumen. Associated with hypertension, bicuspid aortic valve, inherited connective tissue disorders (eg, Marfan syndrome). Can present with tearing, sudden-onset chest pain radiating to the back +/− markedly unequal BP in arms. CXR can show mediastinal widening. Can result in organ ischemia, aortic rupture, death. Two types:

Stanford type A (proximal): involves Ascending aorta (red arrow in

A ). May extend to aortic arch or descending aorta (blue arrow in

A ). May result in acute aortic regurgitation or cardiac tamponade. Treatment: surgery.

Stanford type B (distal): involves only descending aorta (Below left subclavian artery). Treatment: β-blockers, then vasodilators.

Angina Chest pain due to ischemic myocardium 2° to coronary artery narrowing or spasm; no myocyte necrosis.

Stable—usually 2° to atherosclerosis (≥ 70% occlusion); exertional chest pain in classic distribution (usually with ST depression on ECG), resolving with rest or nitroglycerin.

document (2) 

Testicular torsion Rotation of testicle around spermatic cord and vascular pedicle. Commonly presents in males 12–18 years old. May occur after an inciting event (eg, trauma) or spontaneously. Characterized by acute, severe pain, high-riding testis, and absent cremasteric reflex. Treatment: surgical correction (orchiopexy) within 6 hours, manual detorsion if surgical option unavailable in timeframe. If testis is not viable, orchiectomy. Orchiopexy, when performed, should be bilateral because the contralateral testis is at risk for subsequent torsion.

Varicocele Dilated veins in pampiniform plexus due to  venous pressure; most common cause of scrotal enlargement in adult males; most often on left side because of  resistance to flow from left gonadal vein drainage into left renal vein; can cause infertility because of • temperature; diagnosed by standing clinical exam/Valsalva maneuver (distension on inspection and “bag of worms” on palpation; augmented by Valsalva) or ultrasound A ; does not transilluminate. Treatment: consider surgical ligation or embolization if associated with pain or infertility.

Extragonadal germ cell Arise in midline locations. In adults, most commonly in retroperitoneum, mediastinum, pineal, and tumors suprasellar regions. In infants and young children, sacrococcygeal teratomas are most common.

Scrotal masses Benign scrotal lesions present as testicular masses that can be transilluminated (vs solid testicular tumors).

Congenital hydrocele Common cause of scrotal swelling A in infants, Transilluminating swelling. due to incomplete obliteration of processus vaginalis. Most spontaneously resolve within 1 year.

Germ cell tumors account for ∼ 95% of all testicular tumors. Arise from germ cells that produce sperm. Most often occur in young men. Risk factors: cryptorchidism, Klinefelter syndrome. Can present as a mixed germ cell tumor. Do not transilluminate. Usually not biopsied (risk of seeding scrotum), removed via radical orchiectomy.

Nutcracker syndrome—compression of left renal vein between superior mesenteric artery and aorta. Characterized by abdominal (flank) pain and gross hematuria (from rupture of thin-walled renal varicosities).

Superior mesenteric artery syndrome— characterized by intermittent intestinal obstruction symptoms (primarily postprandial pain) when SMA and aorta compress transverse (third) portion of duodenum. Typically occurs in conditions associated with diminished mesenteric fat (eg, low body weight/malnutrition).

Celiac trunk Branches of celiac trunk: common hepatic, splenic, and left gastric. These constitute the main blood supply of the foregut. Strong anastomoses exist between:

Pathologic blood in portal HTN Flow through TIPS, re-establishing normal fow direction

Varicesof gut, butt, and caput (medusae) are commonly seen with portal hypertension.

Treatment with a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) between the portal vein and hepatic vein relieves portal hypertension by shunting blood to the systemic circulation, bypassing the liver. TIPS can precipitate hepatic encephalopathy due to  clearance of ammonia from shunting.

Pectinate line Also called dentate line. Formed where endoderm (hindgut) meets ectoderm.

Above pectinate line: internal hemorrhoids, adenocarcinoma.

Internal hemorrhoids receive visceral innervation and are therefore not painful.

Below pectinate line: external hemorrhoids, anal fissures, squamous cell carcinoma.

External hemorrhoids receive somatic innervation (inferior rectal branch of pudendal nerve) and are therefore painful if thrombosed.

Anal fissure—tear in anal mucosa below Pectinate line. Pain while Pooping; blood on toilet Paper. Located Posteriorly because this area is Poorly Perfused. Innervated by Pudendal nerve. Associated with low-fiber diets and constipation.

Anatomy of the heart

LA is the most posterior part of the heart A ; enlargement of the LA (eg, in mitral stenosis) can lead to compression of the esophagus (dysphagia) and/or the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, a branch of the vagus nerve, causing hoarseness (Ortner syndrome).

RV is the most anterior part of the heart and most commonly injured in trauma.

Key:

LAD and its branches supply anterior 2/3 of interventricular septum, anterolateral papillary muscle, and anterior surface of LV. Most commonly occluded.

PDA supplies AV node (dependent on dominance), posterior 1/3 of interventricular septum, posterior 2/3 walls of ventricles, and posteromedial papillary muscle.

RCA supplies SA node (blood supply independent of dominance). Infarct may cause nodal dysfunction (bradycardia or heart block). Right (acute) marginal artery supplies RV.

Dominance:

Right-dominant circulation (85%) = PDA arises from RCA.

Left-dominant circulation (8%) = PDA arises from LCX.
